 Hours after soldiers blocked opposition deputies from examining ballots in the disputed July 6 elections, the government party assured the nation Monday that a new congress will be certified by a Sept. 1 deadline. Soldiers wearing helmets and carrying automatic rifles stopped about 150 opposition representatives late Sunday night from entering a room at the Legislative Palace where millions of ballots are being held. The deputies-elect said the ballots would prove opposition charges that the governing <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>, rigged the election. The army is required to guard the ballots until the election is certified. The air of antagonism at the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, now sitting as an electoral college, raised the question of whether the review will be finished in time for the president to swear in a new chamber by the constitutional deadline. The <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> holds a slim plurality in the chamber. Once the chamber finishes ratifying 26 disputed congressional races, it is supposed to move on to the presidential election. By custom, the outgoing chief executive formally introduces his successor to the nation on Sept. 1 during his final state-of-the-union address. Failure to do so would be an embarrassing breach of tradition, even though the new president is not sworn in until Dec. 1. Missing the deadline could `` interrupt the constitutional order and put the nation on the threshold of a coup d'etat'' <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s best-known political commentators, said Monday in the independent daily El Universal. The confrontation between soldiers and deputies was the latest in a series of incidents that marked the review of an election which produced unprecedented opposition gains. It was front-page news throughout <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Before dawn on Monday, a few hours after the incident, the leader of the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> delegation, <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON>, told reporters `` there will be a chamber on time'' despite the conflict. The showdown prompted two prominent Roman Catholic clergymen to issue statements. The archbishops of <LOCATION> Zacatecas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> <PERSON> Barragan </PERSON>, and of <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Disan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON>, said they hoped common sense would prevail and the electoral college would finish by Sept. 1. The PRI-dominated <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has said the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> candidate, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, won with 50.36 percent of the vote. Mexican presidents serve single, six-year terms beginning on Dec. 1. The <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> has won every presidential election since it was created in 1929. <PERSON> Lucia </PERSON> <PERSON> Santes </PERSON>, a leader of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> in southeastern <LOCATION> Tabasco </LOCATION> state, meanwhile said she had switched to the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>. She said she had been the object of `` low blows, envy and rancor'' and that the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> `` represents the real option for change.'' The Santes defection was a blow to supporters of <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, presidential candidate for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the largest opposition party, who ran strongly in <LOCATION> Tabasco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> came in second place in presidential voting but maintains that a fair count would make him the winner. Late Monday, <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> filed criminal charges against <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calles </PERSON>, the technical secretary, accusing them of violating the electoral code by not releasing individual results from nearly half of the 55,000 voting stations nationwide. <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> also is interior minister. `` We asked that the -LRB- vote -RRB- information be made known and that the authorities fulfill their responsibility,'' <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> said. He brought charges against the two earlier this month but was told he needed to file personally with the federal attorney general's office.

 Temperatures fell, the wind died down and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> arrived Monday, improving conditions for weary firefighters battling forest fires that have charred thousands of acres of <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, especially in Yellowstone National Park. A first wave of 612 infantrymen from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, landed at <LOCATION> Bozeman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, and headed for the 157,000-acre Clover Mist fire in <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s northeastern corner. Soldiers were to help prevent the fire, one of 10 burning in the park involving about 350,000 acres, from crossing into <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Custer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> or commercial areas of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s Shoshone National Forest Park spokeswoman <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON> said it was possible some of the soldiers might remain in the southern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> towns of <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and Silvergate to help protect them from the Clover Mist fire burning about 3 miles to the south. Approximately 3,000 firefighters were at work in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, the nation's first national park. Elsewhere, reinforcements were called out in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> to back up firefighters working to keep the 700-acre Eagle Bar fire away from a timber sale tract in the <ORGANIZATION> Payette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON> said two 20-member crews were on the scene and three more were expected; an order was put in for 280 more people. Wind blew at only 5 to 15 mph Monday in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, down from Saturday's 60 mph gusts. However, the park's south entrance remained closed, forcing visitors coming from the south to detour about 150 miles to the park's west entrance at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, Mont. The northern gate and two eastern entries remained open. Other roads closed included the road from the south entrance to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thumb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Junction </LOCATION>, on the shore of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>; the road from <ORGANIZATION> Madison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junction </ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> <PERSON> Juction </PERSON> and on to Indian <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>; and from <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> to Canyon Junction, an east-west shortcut between the western and eastern sides of the main road that circles the park in a rough hourglass pattern. The closings basically cut off the shortest route between the west and north entrances. And closing the Norris-Canyon road meant the trip from <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Junction </LOCATION> on the western side of the park to the famous Fishing Bridge in the east went from 39 miles up to 54, by way of the Old Faithful geyser. The majority of the park remained accessible. In addition, the <LOCATION> Grant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> area, which contains a hotel, campground, visitor center and park staff dormitories, was closed, as were the Norris, <LOCATION> Pebble </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Madison </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> campgrounds. The park contains 12 campgrounds. South of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>, in Grand Teton National Park and the <ORGANIZATION> Bridger-Teton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, the Hunter fire that had grown to more than 2,900 acres in one day had calmed Monday, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bright </PERSON>, fire information officer. In addition, firefighters completed bulldozer lines around the southwest and northwest flanks of the Hunter blaze, and officials allowed residents evacuated Saturday to return to their homes, as well as guests of the <ORGANIZATION> Teton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Lost </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranch </LOCATION>, Bright said. Meanwhile, a preliminary investigation concluded that a helicopter involved in firefighting efforts in the <ORGANIZATION> Bighorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> crashed after it lost power to its rear rotor, which stabilizes the craft. Investigators are unsure why the rotor lost power, fire information officer <PERSON> Harvalou </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> said. Last Friday's crash killed <PERSON> Merrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON>, 51, a <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> communications technician, and injured the pilot and two other passengers. Officials in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> took advantage of the calmer, cooler weather to have crews dig a fire line by hand in rugged terrain along the southern edge of the 13-day-old Warm Springs Creek fire, southeast of <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>. `` They'll be right at the burning edge,'' fire information officer <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Krepps </PERSON> said Monday. He said the 37,200-acre fire was only smoldering there Monday, allowing crews to go in with less risk. Officials predicted the fire would be contained Tuesday night. Elsewhere in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, 20 smokejumpers parachuted into the <LOCATION> Storm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> fire that has burned 22,000 acres of the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness, and 80 more were to be taken in by four-wheel drive vehicles, said Beartooth District Ranger <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaquith </PERSON>. The fire raced eight miles in a matter of hours Saturday, kicked up by high wind, he said. The Hellroaring Creek fire, in a different section of the same giant wilderness area northeast of Yellowstone National Park, had covered an estimated 24,400 acres by Monday. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pittman </PERSON> said about 360 firefighters were working on the blaze, which officials hope will burn into natural barriers. In southeastern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, officials called for reinforcements to help battle a blaze out of control south of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lands </ORGANIZATION> said the <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> fire _ fanned by wind blowing at 35 to 40 mph _ had grown to 10,000 to 12,000 acres, but firefighters expected to contain the blaze Tuesday.

<HEAD>Reports Up To 710 Soviets Killed In Afghan Rocket Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A British newspaper said Tuesday up to 710 Soviet soldiers and civilians were killed in a rocket attack by Afghan rebels on a military base north of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> said its account of the rocket assault, that occurred either Aug. 10 or 11, was based on reports received in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, from Afghan guerrillas. Earlier reports had surfaced from diplomatic and guerrilla sources of the attack on the <LOCATION> Kalagay </LOCATION> military base 100 miles north of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, but they had few details and a lower death toll. <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bone </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION> reported a spokesman for a guerrilla group said the rockets devastated the Kalagay ammunition depot and turned the Soviet compound into an inferno. Bone quoted the spokesman, who was not identified, as saying, `` Maybe it was lucky but it was a good hit and our greatest day.'' Western diplomatic sources in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> had said at least 109 Soviet soldiers died at <LOCATION> Kalagay </LOCATION>. Bone said the casualties were much higher according to a report written on cloth by <PERSON> Muhibullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, a guerrilla commander in the <LOCATION> Kalagay </LOCATION> district, and received in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bone </PERSON> said <PERSON> Muhibullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>'s report quoted a leader of the government militia as saying 598 Soviet soldiers and 112 Soviet civilians were killed and 284 Soviets were wounded. He wrote that the report said the guerrillas fired eight 107mm rockets into the supply base. Western reporters generally are barred from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and there was no independent confirmation of conflicting claims by the government and guerrillas. If the report attributed to <PERSON> Muhibullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> was accurate, it would be possibly the worst single loss by <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> forces since they entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to help the Marxist government battle the rebels. Under an accord signed by <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> with Soviet participation last April, all Soviet military personnesl are to be withdrawn from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Feb. 15. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had up to 115,000 troopers in the country but announced that half of the force had been removed as of Aug. 15 according to the withdrawal schedule. The anti-communist guerrillas did not participate in the peace negotiations and have vowed to continue their fight.

 Hurricane forecasters Monday were tracking three tropical depressions, the closest one expected to gradually strengthen as it moves into the western <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. The newest tropical depression formed Monday in the middle <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, east of the <LOCATION> Lesser </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antilles </LOCATION>. The westward-moving system's highest sustained winds were near 35 mph around a center roughly 325 miles east of the island of <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION> reported at 10:30 p.m. Monday. The depression was moving about 20 to 25 mph. An <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> reconnaissance aircraft was scheduled to investigate the depression Tuesday morning. Forecasters were most concerned with the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> depression, which was moving west-northwest at about at about 15 to 20 mph and had highest sustained winds of near 35 mph, the hurricane center said. The poorly organized depression was about 175 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>. `` The one in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> probably has the best potential,'' said forecaster <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Case </PERSON>. `` Once it moves into the western <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, it seems more favorable for development.'' Some strengthening was expected over the next 24 hours, <ORGANIZATION> Case </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. `` Any time there's a tropical depression southeast of us at this time of year, you need to pay attention,'' Case added. Of the tropical activity, <PERSON> Case </PERSON> said it was `` quite normal'' at this point in the hurricane season, which began June 1 and ends Nov. 30. `` We're really approaching the peak of the season,'' he said. Little strengthening was expected in the newly formed depression unless it slowed its forward speed, Case said. Meanwhile, the most distant system, located about 200 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antao </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> west </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, was moving northwest at 15 to 20 mph into colder water, and little change in strength was expected until a gradual decrease late Tuesday. Its highest sustained winds were estimated near 35 mph. Depressions are upgraded to named tropical storms when their sustained winds reach 39 mph and to hurricanes when winds hit 74 mph. There have been two tropical storms so far in the 1988 <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> hurricane season, but neither reached hurricane strength.

 Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told a veterans group Monday `` absolutely no influence was used'' to get him into the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> during the height of the Vietnam War. In brief remarks to a convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, the Republican vice presidential nominee: `` Influence was not even necessary if I had chosen to use it, which I never would have. `` The reason is because my <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> unit had openings before I applied, they had openings when I applied, and they had openings after I applied. So there was absolutedly no influence used.'' The crowd of about 2,500 veterans cheered and whistled turing the hastily called appearance, in which the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator joked: `` My national guard unit was never called up to active duty, but let me say that after these last 72 hours no one can say I've never faced combat.'' Presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his aides have sought to play down suggestions that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s candidacy needed shoring up after a rocky week dominated by the controversy over whether <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, a pro-military conservative on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, pulled strings to enter the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in 1969 as his college draft deferment was about to end. In a report in Tuesday's editions of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, the guard official who swore in <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he received no special treatment. Retired major general <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahner </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that `` there had to have been a vacancy before he enlisted.'' The -LRB- <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> -RRB- Plain Dealer reported, however, that records show the guard under a virtual freeze on recruitment imposed 49 days before <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s enlistment on May 19, 1969. The documents also appear to contradict assertions from some former <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officers that the Guard had more than 200 vacancies and therefore was open to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> without special treatment or favoritism, the story said. At the VFW conference, where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had appeared earlier Monday, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also said he hoped to put the issue of his military record behind him so attention could be focused on `` the real issues'' of the campaign. `` The question before all of us is: Not what <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> did 20 years in the past _ but what either President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or President <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will do in the future to secure world peace,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. The circumstances surrounding <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s unplanned, last-minute appearance before the veterans group were in dispute. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> LaDue </PERSON>, the spokesman for the organization, said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was invited Monday after Illinois Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> intervened with Commander in Chief Earl Stock. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> is a key <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporter in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> press secretary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON> said <PERSON> Stock </PERSON> made the invitation. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, communications director for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, said members of the VFW encouraged <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> to persuade <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to appear. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> flew back to the nation's capital Sunday, accompanied by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign chairman and top strategist, to meet with the new campaign staff assembled for him by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> departed from his prepared remarks to a Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on Monday to defend his running mate: `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> served in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, signing up in a unit that had vacancies at the time and now he is under shrill partisan attack,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, his voice rising. `` So let his attackers cast the first stone. He served honorably. True, he did n't go to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, but his unit was n't sent. `` But there's another truth _ he did not go to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, he did not burn his draft card and he damned sure did n't burn the American flag,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, drawing cheers and a standing ovation from the veterans. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is scheduled to return to the campaign trail Wednesday, certain to face more questions about the Guard issue and how he got into law school when he did not meet admission requirements. He is to attend legislative conferences in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, before traveling to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, where aides say he will deliver a major address to the Enlisted Association of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, composed of current and former enlisted personnel. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> reported that during his 1980 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> referred to himself in political pamphlets as a `` Vietnam-era veteran.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> dropped the reference after objections by some <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> combat veterans. Although the reference was technically correct, <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> said that his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> duty was not the type of service implied in the leaflet. In the interview, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also said his influential family did n't pull strings to get him admitted to <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> The staff that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign has assembled for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is a group with substantial experience in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and presidential politics. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, a longtime <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> adviser and member of the president's `` kitchen cabinet,'' is chairing <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s campaign. His deputy is <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Canzeri </PERSON>, known as an expert detail man during his years in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House. <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, long a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> intimate, is a savvy strategist who has been at <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s side in most of his political decisions. <PERSON> Canzeri </PERSON> served <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>, titan of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s moderate wing, for nearly 20 years. A presidential assistant and deputy to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>, <PERSON> Canzeri </PERSON> was known as a Mr. <PERSON> Fixit </PERSON> in the White House for his quick humor and ability to get things done. <PERSON> Canzeri </PERSON> resigned in 1982 under a cloud after accepting mortgages from friends at favorable interest rates and double-billing the White House and the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for `` $ 700 and change'' for two dinners he gave while out of the country preparing for presidential trips. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> later concluded that <PERSON> Canzeri </PERSON> did not violate federal law. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON>, was <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>'s spokesman and also worked at the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House.

<HEAD>Valerie Harper Denies She Tried to Control `Valerie' Show</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Actress <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> denied from the witness stand Monday that she demanded absolute control over the TV series she was fired from, declaring, `` I was n't trying to be <PERSON> Genghis </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>.'' `` I wanted to have participation, early knowledge of stories so I would be in a partnership on the show,'' she said of her situation comedy series `` Valerie.'' Ms. <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> was called to the stand by attorneys for <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION>, the production company suing her for alleged breach of contract. She is countersuing the company, contending it wrongfully fired her from the show. Attorney <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Engel </PERSON> sought to show that Ms. <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> was aware of all aspects of her 1985 contract with <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> and tried to renegotiate it because she craved more money and total control over all aspects of the show. Ms. <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> denied this, saying that she left business matters in the hands of her husband, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cacciotti </PERSON>, and left the contract to her agent and lawyer whose advice she later came to doubt. `` I'm not good with contracts,'' she said, holding the <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> document. `` I read these and start to get cross-eyed.'' Ms. <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> acknowledged that even before the pilot for `` Valerie'' was sold, her relations with other members of the production staff began to erode. The first problem, she said, arose when <PERSON> Cacciotti </PERSON>'s name was left off the list of credits on the pilot for `` Valerie'' even though he had acted as supervising producer. `` I was disappointed and hurt,'' she said. `` It felt like a betrayal.'' She told jurors that she and <PERSON> Cacciotti </PERSON> have been business partners since 1979 and have been married just over a year. <PERSON> Engel </PERSON> enumerated the financial terms of the contract that brought Ms. <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> $ 1.5 million for the first one-and-a-half seasons on the air and provided profit shares and escalating salaries for her and her husband in subsequent years.

She faulted herself for letting too many unwritten agreements stay out of the contract. `` There was a rush to sign the contract and -LRB- they said -RRB- we'll work out the details later,'' she said Ms. <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> said, she sought to renegotiate her contract later to increase her salary and put in writing her creative participation in story ideas for each episode. By then, she conceded, she felt she was losing the right to affect story lines. `` The consultation I had enjoyed had eroded and the relationship with -LRB- the producers -RRB- had started to turn,'' she said. `` What you thought you had was total control,'' said <PERSON> Engel </PERSON>. `` I would disagree,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>. `` I wanted participation, not control ... I was n't trying to be <PERSON> Genghis </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>. I wanted participation with people I loved and respected.'' <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> fired Ms. <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> from the show a year ago and replaced her with <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>. The show is now known as `` The <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> Family.'' Ms. <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>'s testimony came on her 48th birthday, but the event was not mentioned in the courtroom.

 The basement warren called The Hole where fire claimed seven lives is one of hundreds of illegal `` social clubs'' dotting the city's poorer neighborhoods that continue to operate despite repeated police raids. More than 30 people were injured in the fire at the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> club Sunday afternoon as 60 to 100 panicked patrons tried to escape through the lone exit. Despite periodic campaigns to close them down, social clubs _ a local term everyone admits is misleading _ have been centers of urban problems ranging from noise and double-parking to gambling, prostitution and drug dealing. Police had raided The Hole five times since March to try to shut it down. Rife with building, health and fire code violations, the clubs repeatedly have been the scene of serious fires, including one in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> three years ago that killed five people. Such clubs are common in large cities. In 1967 a police raid on an illegal club in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> _ `` blind pig'' was the local term _ sparked days of rioting. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, alcohol is sold without a license at more than 200 locations, according to estimates by police precinct commanders. Clubs have operated in the past at another 400 locations and could reopen any time. Some were closed under the city's `` padlock law,'' which allows police to shutter a location for a year if two crimes are committed on the site within a 12-month period. But police have been unable to close many other clubs. The Hole, first raided in May 1984, is a prime example. Police hit the club five times between March 22 and July 26, seizing cash and liquor and arresting a total of nine people, most of them employees charged with selling liquor without a state license. But the club never stayed closed because the police could n't get even the two criminal convictions needed under the padlock law. When the fire broke out Sunday most of the cases were still plodding through the city's overloaded court system. In the three that were resolved, defendants were allowed to plead guilty to disorderly conduct and pay fines of between $ 50 and $ 100. `` That is useless to us,'' said Deputy Inspector <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Biehler </PERSON>, because disorderly conduct does not qualify as a criminal conviction under the padlock law. The fines were particularly puny compared to those prescribed for violations of the liquor law _ about $ 10,000 each. Despite the label, places like The Hole are neither social nor clubs. `` The consumption of alcohol is often of secondary importance,'' a state task force report said. `` The primary function of these operations has developed into prostitution, gambling, drugs and trafficking in stolen property.'' City police have made 1,128 arrests at clubs in the past 12 months. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> liquor licenses cost up to $ 5,100 and are good for three years. But many people do not apply for one, often because they have a criminal record or plan to employ others who do. Also, if a bar is not licensed it does n't have to worry about state inspectors `` coming in and seeing things they do n't want seen,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Chernela </PERSON>, spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Liquor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. Just about anyone can go to a social club, despite the term's implication of exclusivity An employee usually keeps an eye on the door, but a club member is generally anyone who walks in on a given night. Or morning. While the city's licensed bars are required to close by 4 a.m., social clubs often are open until dawn or later, usually to the distress of neighborhood residents. When the police do stage a raid, securing evidence is problematic. `` When we come in, a lot of things hit the floor and go down the toilet,'' <PERSON> Biehler </PERSON> said. Owners are rarely convicted. `` When you arrest a bartender, you have n't arrested the guy who's really calling the shots, and so the place is back in business with a new bartender the next day,'' <PERSON> Chernela </PERSON> said. `` After a tragedy like this everyone looks at the government, but it's a very difficult problem,'' said <PERSON> Chernela </PERSON>. `` You close them and they just spring back up.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigoloff </PERSON>, the corporate `` White Knight'' who rescued <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc. from bankruptcy five years ago, on Sunday announced a management-led leveraged buyout offer of $ 12 a share The retail giant, including the Builder's Emporium and <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Furniture </ORGANIZATION> stores, also announced a net loss of $ 12.4 million for the second quarter ended July 30, said company spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sitrick </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sigoloff </PERSON> disclosed that <ORGANIZATION> WII </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a firm he established with members of his <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> management team, will offer to purchase nearly 40 million shares of outstanding common stock, <PERSON> Sitrick </PERSON> said. He said WII stands for W-2 or <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> 2. The offer is nearly $ 3 higher than <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION>' closing stock price of 9 -RRB- on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> last Friday. `` While I have strong confidence in the long-term viability and prospects of our continuing businesses,'' <PERSON> Sigoloff </PERSON> said in a prepared statement, `` it has become increasingly clear to me, as well as the other directors of the company, that our stockholders want to maximize the value of their investment in the company in the immediate near-term.'' The 39,846,600 shares sought in the merger deal represent about 83 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION>' outstanding shares, <PERSON> Sitrick </PERSON> said. The offer is scheduled to be in effect from Aug. 26 to Oct. 20, he said. It is expected that the principal investors in <ORGANIZATION> WII </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> will be institutional investors, including <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which promised no problems in arranging financing for the buyout, <PERSON> Sitrick </PERSON> said. The offer is void if fewer than 50 percent of outstanding shares are sold, he said. The company's net loss for the second quarter amounted to 28 cents a share, with reported earnings of $ 10.4 million, or 19 cents a share, on sales of $ 937.9 million and losses from discontinued operation of $ 22.8 million, or 47 cents a share. In April 1982, <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION>, with assets estimated at about $ 3 billion, became the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company to file for bankruptcy protection. But less than two years later, creditors approved a plan allowing <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> to emerge from Chapter 11 proceedings. Analysts had predicted it would take <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> at least five years to erase the accumulated red ink. The force behind the comeback was <PERSON> Sigoloff </PERSON>, who earned the nickname `` Ming the Merciless'' for the tough-minded business moves and hard-nosed cost cutting he employed to resuscitate two other <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> companies in the 1970s: <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Daylin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sigoloff </PERSON> reorganized <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> by selling off seasonal divisions such as <ORGANIZATION> MacGregor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Golf </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> At the same time he revamped store displays and appeared in television commercials and offered his personal guarantee of renewed product quality and service.

<HEAD>British Arms Sales Boom: From Bullets To Jet Fighters

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is booming as an arms dealer, supplanting the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as wealthy <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s biggest supplier and edging out long-time rival <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> globally as purveyor of everything from bullets to jet fighters. Less particular than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> about who buys its increasingly sophisticated wares, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has doubled its sales in the past three years through a mixture of politics, hard-sell and technical advances. The most glittering prize is a $ 17 billion deal clinched last month with <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> that includes 50 Tornado fighter-bombers. It underlines <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s major advantage over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>: there are no political constraints on British arms sales to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Arab enemies. `` The number of restrictions the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has on sales is preposterous,'' says <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Tusa </PERSON>, analyst at the London-based <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Saudis have made it clear that they are not going to be told any longer by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, ` You can have what you want _ but only a third of it and not for another five years and providing you do n't base it where you want to','' he said in an interview. With the ink just dry on the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> deal, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Younger </PERSON> was back in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, this time in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, talking arms. About the same time, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> blocked the sale of Maverick air-to-surface missiles that were to accompany 40 American F-18 fighters <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> had agreed to buy, throwing doubt on the near $ 2 billion deal. `` Our friends and friendly rivals have their problems,'' acknowledged an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, requesting anonymity. With a staff of 250, the organization's main job is to oil the wheels of sales drives by privately owned British armament manufacturers, such as the airplane giant British Aerospace, and also check that they do n't sell to banned countries. These include <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which is officially under a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> arms embargo since the 1982 invasion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. According to <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> figures, between 1985 and 1987 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> doubled to 12 percent its share of the world arms market outside the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> says, is now the world's third largest arms supplier, ranking well behind the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> probably gives away more than we sell worldwide,'' said one official _ and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but pushing <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> down to fourth place. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> signed defense contracts worth $ 4 billion in 1985. In 1986, the figure was nearly $ 9 billion with a first major Saudi contract to buy Tornado planes, and last year contracts totaled an estimated $ 5.6 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chief Sir <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, who received a knighthood this year on Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s recommendation, says <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 1987 figure keeps it ahead of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. In 1986, with the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> deal, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> moved temporarily into second place, ahead of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has assiduously cultivated the oil-rich Saudis on official visits and rolled out the red carpet for King Fahd in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. She slips in plugs for British armaments during foreign trips, including recently in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> are competing for a multimillion-dollar order for nuclear-powered submarines. British officials, arms manufacturers and some analysts say prime factors in the increased sales are improved weapons and warplanes, including the multinational Tornado developed with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, and the free-enterprise atmosphere generated by nearly a decade of <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> government. `` It is a fact that we're producing more things with fewer people,'' said a British official, adding the 130,000-strong workforce in the defense industry has declined slightly in the past few years. He requested anonymity. Others familiar with the secretive world of arms sales say <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has also been hurt by a tradition of gearing arms exports to Third World countries on generous credit terms. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, marketing director for <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION>, one of five British defense electronics manufacturers, said that with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> cutting defense spending, companies are forced to expand foreign sales. `` We have to go and slug it out in the market place in the major countries,'' said <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> in an interview. <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION> says its annual turnover from defense sales has more than trebled to $ 850 million since 1980, with sonar systems going to the Swedish, <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> and South Korean navies, an $ 850 million communications network for the Australian army, and smaller deals with <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and an unidentified Far Eastern country. But British manufacturers have suffered some big failures too. The most expensive was the scrapping of the Nimrod spy plane in 1986, after nine years' work by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> costing nearly $ 1.7 billion. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> ordered the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airborne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warning </ORGANIZATION> and Command System instead.

 Soldiers manned barricades in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s capital Monday and most shops were closed as merchants heeded student calls for a nationwide strike to demand a return to democracy, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> news service said The general strike was expected to be a test for President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, who came to power Friday and is <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s first civilian leader in the 26 years since a military coup replaced democracy with one-party rule. A messenger representing student groups, defying an 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. curfew, ran through residential areas of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> to rally support for the strike, the Japanese news agency reported from the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> capital. Soldiers stood at major points in the center of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, where barbed wire barricades had been erected to guard against demonstrators, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> said, adding that people were seen cutting palm trees on the roads to set up barricades against the military. The report quoted unidentified sources as saying a large number of demonstrators rode trucks into the capital on Sunday night. An <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> diplomat in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> said the city was `` relatively quiet'' Monday morning. For the sixth straight day Sunday, authorities released people arrested in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> during Aug. 8-12 riots that prompted the resignation of <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, after only 17 days in power. Troops fired into crowds of demonstrators in the riots, and the government said 112 people were killed. Official Radio <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> said 100 people were freed Sunday, bringing the total reported released in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> to 408. Thousands of people are still believed detained. On Saturday, people demonstrated peacefully in <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s second-largest city, and in five other towns, according to Radio <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> The state-run newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Working </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday that during the Aug. 8-12 protests, hysterical mobs decapitated at least five people, including three police officers, in the <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Okkalapa </LOCATION>. `` Two of the -LRB- policemen's -RRB- heads were stuck on bamboo poles and one was put on a stool for all to see,'' according to the newspaper, obtained Sunday from a Western embassy in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. The report said the protesters then burned the bodies. One of the victims was a civilian mistaken for an intelligence agent and beheaded after a mob stoned him to death, it said. `` The leader of the demonstration in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Okkalapa </LOCATION> township wore a hood to hide his face as he screamed at the top of his voice for the emergence of the ` <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> government,''' the newspaper said. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, the country's leading dissident, was arrested with several other prominent figures July 29-30. Among those seized was Sein Win, the <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The wave of turmoil in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> began July 27, when leader <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON> resigned and <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> came to power. A retired army general, <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> was widely hated for ruthlessly suppressing dissent, and disturbances began almost immediately. At first peaceful, the demonstrations became violent on Aug. 8 and security personnel fired shots to disperse the crowds. Some protesters fought back and the government said 112 people were killed and 267 wounded in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. Diplomats there believe hundreds may have been killed. The violence continued until Aug. 12, when <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> resigned. But smaller, student-led protests continued almost daily to press for an end to one-party rule and for economic reforms. The <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> diplomat said the government was unlikely to agree to multi-party democracy after a quarter-century of iron-fisted control by the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, founded by Gen. Ne Win. The general led the March 2, 1962, coup that toppled the elected government of Prime Minister U Nu. <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> media also have rejected the idea of returning to a multi-party system, noting in recent days that the government during <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s 14 years of democracy was corrupt and inefficient. But officials have said in recent days that the current government also is corrupt. A <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat, who asked for anonymity, said Saturday that <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> has remained silent on the issue. The president did not flatly reject democracy in his speech Friday before the emergency party session that elected him.

The band, which had six Top 10 hits during the series that ran from 1966 to 1968, is enjoying a revival of its show on cable television. `` I'm closer in spirit to their ages now,'' guitarist <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Tork </PERSON>, 46, said Saturday before performing at convention. `` I thought I was older then.'' <PERSON> Tork </PERSON> was joined by fellow <PERSON> Monkees </PERSON> <PERSON> Micky </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolenz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Davy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> at the convention, but <PERSON> Nesmith </PERSON> declined to attend.

 Supermarket checker <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> says she's glad her moment in the spotlight as solo singer at the opening of the 1984 Olympic Summer Games did n't catapult her to instant success `` I'm not disappointed for what has happened because being thrust in at that level with my inexperience would have been a mistake,'' <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> said. `` I really would n't have had an inkling of how to handle it.'' Still, she has fond memories of the grand event four years ago. `` It was the most spectacular moment. It was bigger than life,'' she said recently. `` It was a really magical experience.'' Ms. <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> sang the hit, `` Reach Out and Touch -LRB- Somebody's Hand -RRB-'' at the opening ceremonies of the 1984 Olympics at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Memorial Coliseum The $ 7 million opening ceremony had a cast of thousands and was staged before a capacity crowd of 90,000 and an international television audience. The show included a 1,000-voice choir, a 750-piece marching band, a 100-piece symphony orchestra, 7,500 athletes and 2,500 pigeons. Ms. <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, who was 30 at the time, appeared as the lead singer in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jazz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Choir </LOCATION>, a position originally intended for a star of the caliber of <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>. But after Olympics officials heard her sing, they chose her to perform because they liked the idea of having an unknown singer. `` It was kind of in keeping with the amateur spirit of the Olympics,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> said she is happy working as a professional singer, performing at banquets and ceremonies and with the group Daddy's Money, which performs nostalgic and rhythm and blues songs `` I have n't really done a <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> act as of yet,'' she said. `` I'm still looking for a repertoire.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel are reporting increased harassment by local officials, but there is no indication the actions are part of a new campaign by the government of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities said Sunday. <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, said the incidents involved harassment, `` not attacks.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is commander of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and controls the civilian government. He was indicted in February by two grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has imposed economic sanctions in an effort to force him to resign and leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. A statement by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> late Sunday called the accusations of harassment part of a campaign of disinformation in an effort to destabilize <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and listed numerous allegations of misconduct by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> said the reports of harassment are coming only from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel. `` Civilians, business people and embassy personnel have reported no increase in harassment,'' she said. She added she did not know if <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel are being bothered more or are `` simply reporting more cases.'' An official at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 240 cases of harassment had been reported between February and August of this year. He said incidents of harassment have increased in number and gravity but denied reports the incidents were being considered attacks. `` What's going on these days has been going on for months _ going way back to last year,'' the official said. `` If there was an increase, it probably came in January, February, March and April, not in the last month or two.'' `` One of the things that's happening is that a lot of people are being asked for bribes when they're stopped for traffic violations, and that's probably because the police are n't getting paid regularly'' the official said. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s economy has been damaged by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions. The Southern Command official said a more serious incident occurred last week when <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> officers refused to let <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military vehicles pick up mail for three days at <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s international airport. The dispute was resolved after three days, the official said, but he did not elaborate. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday quoted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Southern Command, State and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials as saying there have been an increasing number of beatings, abductions, rape and extortion of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel and their dependents in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The story, under a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> dateline, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials view the incidents as a campaign by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to pressure the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to lift economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The Defense Forces statement said: `` The supposed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government officials -LRB- cited by the Times -RRB- must have the IQ of a 3-year-old Cro-Magnon when they assert that actions taken by the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel are attempts to force the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to lift or soften economic sanctions imposed on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' The statement said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops cause daily problems for Panamanian authorities, including fights, mistreatment of women, venereal disease, shooting in public places and refusing to pay bar and restaurant tabs. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> imposed economic sanctions on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in March after the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> ousted President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> has since been in hiding, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continues to recognize him as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s legitimate president. About 12,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen are stationed in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> by treaty to protect the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, a vital waterway linking the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> oceans. They are attached to the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, which is in charge of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military operations south of the U.S.-Mexico border. The first Southern Command official reached by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged several specific incidents reported by the Times, including a case in June in which an enlisted man and his wife were assaulted at gunpoint by a man described as a Panamanian military officer. The assailant forced the enlisted man into the trunk of his car, then beat and raped his wife. `` The individual was dressed in a camouflaged uniform, but he could have been military, paramilitary, a civilian guard or just some guy who knows somebody in the PDF -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and somehow managed to get himself a uniform,'' said the Southern Command official. `` As far as I know, we do n't have a definite description or identification.''

 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel says the Veterans Administration made numerous errors as it hurriedly processed disability claims but had time to give special treatment to applicants who `` had the ear'' of influential lawmakers. A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> report, released Sunday, described two separate systems for handling claims. Applicants without `` pull'' had their cases rushed to judgment by error-prone managers trying to win pay bonuses for meeting production quotas, the report said. But the panel said the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> _ the court of last resort for claimants whose benefits were denied _ `` maintained a list of congressmen who should be brought to the <ORGANIZATION> BVA </ORGANIZATION> chairman's attention if they inquire about an appeal. At a hearing last February by the panel's subcommittee on human resources, a former appeals board member, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> J.B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bierman </PERSON>, was asked whether there was preferential treatment when a lawmaker on the list intervened. <PERSON> Bierman </PERSON> replied, `` It is difficult for me to say, but I suspect that to be the case, sir. Otherwise, there would be no reason for it -LRB- the list -RRB-.'' `` The BVA ... showed favoritism to claimants who had the ear of certain influential members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' the committee concluded. The <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement it `` has not been provided with a copy of the committee's report and is obviously disadvantaged by the fact that it was released to the media before it came to us. We intend to review it thoroughly when it is received.'' VA officials refused to reply to the panel's specific allegations. Addressing the appeals board's quota system, the report said, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ... was so caught up in an unreasonable production quota standard, that some members were deciding cases at the rate of one every eight minutes.'' The committee noted that earlier this year, the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> ended production-based bonuses and preferential treatment after both practices were publicized in subcommittee hearings and challenged in a lawsuit filed by <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. The report suggested that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> end a 55-year-old prohibition and allow veterans who are denied benefits to appeal their cases in federal court. In 1987, veterans won less than 13 percent of the time under the now-abolished quota system at the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> appeals board. The committee said the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> tried to cover up its frequent mistakes in disability claims by deliberately under-reporting the error rate to staffers for the human resources subcommittee, headed by Rep. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> approves about $ 11 billion in disability benefits annually to 2.5 million veterans, widows and children. While some veterans were improperly denied benefits under the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION>'s error-plagued system, others may have received money to which they were not entitled, according to committee staffers Nine of the 15 Republicans on the 38-member committee filed dissenting views disagreeing with the recommendation for court appeals. `` While we share the committee's concerns about ... practices such as production quotas ... we can not support the committee's inference that the -LRB- appeals board -RRB- does not have the best interests of the veterans in mind,'' they said The report did not give exact numbers of errors, but cited a 1984 internal study of 1,700 cases by <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>. He found: _ A `` substantive'' error rate of 8.4 percent that led to denial of claims that should have been approved This category refers to mathematical and other factual errors. _ An 18.2 percent `` judgmental'' error rate, in which the wrong decision was made even though the data used to render the opinion were accurate _ A `` procedural'' error rate of 21.5 percent, in cases where the mistake did not affect the final benefit determination The VA, however, gave the subcommittee lower error rates for the 1983-87 period: substantive errors, 1.02 percent to 1.73 percent; judgmental errors, 1.11 percent to 1.81 percent, and procedural discrepancies, 3.91 percent to 5.09 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION>'s quota system was described to the subcommittee earlier this year by <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Bierman </PERSON>. `` They testified that <ORGANIZATION> BVA </ORGANIZATION> members ... had production quotas of 40 cases per week, which if fulfilled, could result in merit pay increases as high as 5 percent of a member's pay,'' the report said.

 It's 8 o'clock at night and <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> is lying on a couch, a pillow over her head to block the light and a telephone pressed to her ear. It's a common scene for a 17-year-old whiling away a summer before senior year in high school. But <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> is at work and she is speaking to a stranger _ an unmarried 19-year-old girl who recently had a baby. `` Her parents ignored her pregnancy and her boyfriend is away in the military,'' said the volunteer listener at <ORGANIZATION> Teen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION>, a teen-to-teen hotline. `` She was just really depressed,'' <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> said. `` She was n't looking for advice, just someone to listen. In the seven years since Teen Line began, more than 50,000 calls have come in to people like <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON>, who was on duty during a recent night with three other teen listeners and an adult health care professional. The listeners work out of <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in an office where nearly every inch of wall space is covered with referral numbers to hundreds of service organizations such as Planned Parenthood, Suicide Prevention, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and AIDS information centers. `` When teens are in need, no matter what their socio-economic status, they contact their peers,'' said psychiatrist Dr. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Groups </ORGANIZATION> and co-founder of Teen Line. `` They wo n't talk to school counselors, psychiatrists or priests, but what they will do is pick up the phone and call a friend.'' Teen Line is staffed nightly from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. Off-hour callers can leave a message and their call will be returned by a teen listener. <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Leader </PERSON>, a senior staff member at <ORGANIZATION> Cedar-Sinai </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatry </ORGANIZATION> and program coordinator of <ORGANIZATION> Teen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION>, say it is one of the most cost-efficient ways to provide mental health services to adolescents Most callers are between ages 13-19, although parents sometimes phone to get a teen-ager's perspective on problems their children are experiencing, Ms. <PERSON> Leader </PERSON> said. Most calls deal with boyfriend-girlfriend problems, but the listeners often hear from pregnant teens, those seeking sexual advice, and child-abuse victims. From 3 percent to 4 percent of the Teen Line calls are suicidal, Ms. <PERSON> Leader </PERSON> said. The volunteer listeners are carefully screened before being accepted, then must train 12 weeks before answering a hotline phone. The training focuses on developing rapport, crisis intervention, addictive behaviors, all aspects of sexuality, family problems and more. The volunteers must attend either a recovery program meeting such as Alcoholics Anonymous or Overeaters Anonymous, participate in a Teen Line outreach program in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> high schools, attend monthly staff meetings and commit one night per week to the hotline. <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Leader </PERSON> and other adult specialists unaffiliated with the program have few reservations about allowing teen-agers to take on the responsibility of suicide calls. `` These young people are in that position anyway,'' <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON> said. `` On a daily basis they are in school with kids and peers who constantly give clues about their own despair.'' The listeners establish if the caller is suicidal through a series of questions. `` We'll ask them, ` Have you ever tried it before? How did you do it? What kinds of pills were they? Do you have them with you now?''' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Yorra </PERSON>, 17, a high school senior who has been a listener for the past year. The callers are encouraged to telephone as often as they want but not to establish a relationship with their listener. `` In that case, they often need ongoing professional therapy,'' Ms. <PERSON> Leader </PERSON> said. Calls are confidential and records are kept only of the caller's age, sex and type of problem Listeners try, however, to get abuse victims to report their cases to the county <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> for immediate action. The hospital provides the office and phones, and the hotline's estimated $ 150,000 in annual costs are covered by individual donations and corporate grants Last November, an 800 number was established for the entire state. Ms. Leader is hoping to expand the service nationwide.

The trial, believed to be the longest federal criminal trial in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history and expected to go to the jury this week, has heard from 89 witnesses and has produced a 5 -LCB- - foot-thick file containing 40,000 pages of transcripts and 850 exhibits During the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> trial, one defendant attended court for a time in a hospital bed until his moaning interfered with the proceedings. One passed out from a too-full bladder. One prosecutor became a father twice. A defense attorney who had been commuting from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> died of cancer. `` It's a nightmare,'' said defense attorney <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> <PERSON> Feinstein </PERSON>. The case is <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Accetturo </PERSON>, et al. The 20 reputed members and associates of the Lucchese organized crime family are charged with racketeering and, variously, loan sharking, illegal gambling, credit card fraud and drug dealing. `` No one imagined when we took this case in November 1986 that we'd still be here,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Critchley </PERSON>, a defense lawyer whose closing arguments lasted five days. <PERSON> Critchley </PERSON>, who leads the defense, represents <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Taccetta </PERSON>, charged as the group's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> boss. Accetturo is the reputed <PERSON> Lucchese </PERSON> family captain who allegedly acted as the ultimate authority from his home in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The group allegedly operated out of the Hole-in-the Wall luncheonette in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, where pictures of <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON>, <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> `` Lucky'' <PERSON> Luciano </PERSON> decorated the walls. Witnesses testified about kisses of respect for the boss, `` tribute'' payments to mob superiors, `` sit-downs,'' where disputes were resolved, and visits to hangouts by manicurists to do the nails of defendants. The Administrative Office of the Courts in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, says the trial is the longest federal criminal trial ever, according to courtroom Deputy Clerk <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>. One of the longest trials in history, a state lawsuit in <LOCATION> Belleville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, against a chemical company, ended in 1987 after 3 -LCB- years. Jurors here have been paid more than $ 175,000. Court-appointed attorneys have received an estimated $ 3 million. The defense calculates the goverment paid or reimbursed cooperating witnesses some $ 300,000. That's in addition to the salaries of three prosecutors and an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent who spent nearly two years full-time on the case, extra deputy marshals for security and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>. Then there's copying costs for a mountain of documents. `` Obviously it's been very expensive, but I think it's been very worthwhile,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who came to the job after the case began. `` I do n't think anybody would say we ca n't go after organized crime just because it's too expensive.'' <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, almost miraculously, has been able to keep up with his civil calendar. But he has been removed from the pool of judges assigned criminal cases, worsening the court's backlog. The length has taken its toll on everyone involved. `` It's difficult to run a town when you are down here,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a defense attorney who was elected mayor of Orange in May. `` It has caused a lot of late nights at city hall.'' `` It's taken a piece out of all of us, not just our practices, but spiritually and emotionally as well,'' said <PERSON> Feinstein </PERSON>. One witness was on the stand for four months. He was among a half-dozen cooperating witnesses _ many with criminal records _ brought to the stand by prosecutors to tell the group's inside story. The defense seized on the issue, telling the jury not to trust convicted criminals and liars. The government countered by saying choir boys would n't know the Mafia's inner workings.

 <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s rocky entry into big-league politics, stumbling over questions about his military record that threaten to overshadow <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign, has left the exuberant young senator bloody but seemingly unbowed. Back in the nation's capital to prepare for his first solo campaign trip Wednesday, the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator remains adamant that he is not an embarrassment to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, has not considered removing himself from the ticket, and sees nothing improper in the way he entered the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> at a time when other young men were marching off to fight in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. But the Republican ticket's public debut at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> convention and on a three-day Midwestern campaign swing saw these extraordinary events: _ <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, asked at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> news conference about his reasons for going into the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in 1969, stumbling over his thoughts and finally declaring: `` I did not know in 1969 that I would be in this room today, I confess. _ <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> standing in mock attention before a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> farewell convention breakfast, reciting to the uneasy audience his name, rank and serial number and proclaiming `` <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Six years and proud of it!'' _ <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, surrounded by reporters and a raucously partisan crowd in his hometown of <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, asserting `` I got into the National Guard fairly'' but acknowledging that he assumed a friend of his wealthy publishing family made calls on his behalf after <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> expressed interest in joining the Guard _ <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, telling reporters in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> that he could not recall what communications he had with his draft board 20 years ago but insisting he distinctly remembered having no conversation `` in the 1980s'' with a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Democrat quoted as saying <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told him he `` rode out'' <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in the Guard _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, calling the controversy a `` tempest in a teapot'' and asserting that his initial campaign swing `` has gone great'' except for `` this frenzy'' of media interest in <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s military record Whether that assessment is accurate remains to be seen. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> seems likely to continue to have to fight portrayals of himself as a wealthy young man who spoke in favor of the Vietnam War but had strings pulled to avoid the draft as his college student deferment was about to expire. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> bomber pilot who saw extensive combat in World War II, defended his running mate, saying that the Vietnam War years in which <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, now 41, pondered his own military service `` were different times.'' As for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> being vulnerable in the area of defense, an area in which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has portrayed <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as weak, the vice president said, `` The difference between the person I'm running against and my running mate are night and day on defense.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides insist they are happy with how <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has handled himself in publicly answering questions about his military record. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> himself says he does not feel the issue has overshadowed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But there was a clear change in campaign strategy after <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s outdoor news conference Friday that was piped over a public address system to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s hometown supporters Their booing of reporters' questions and cheering of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s answers helped create a circus-like atmosphere reminiscent of a Roman gladiatorial bout while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> remained out of sight in a holding room That day, on which the ticket opened its first joint campaign trip in the nation's heartland, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> dominated news stories about the event. The next day, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took charge, defending his running mate in no uncertain terms at a joint news conference and declaring that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s qualifications and background had been examined to his satisfaction. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his aides had to spend a lot of time last week running down `` rumor after insidious rumor,'' and added that the controversy `` is behind us.'' However, some questions may yet need to be answered. There have been conflicting reports, for example, on whether there were vacancies in the Guard at the time <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> entered or whether there was a waiting list. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has said he can not recall those kinds of details. And he has not spelled out publicly the extent of his knowledge about what calls were made on his behalf or to whom they were made. A retired Guard official, who is a friend of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s family and worked for the family newspaper, has said he did contact the Guard on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s behalf. The commander of the Guard unit to which <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was assigned, however, has said he did not receive a call from anyone urging <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s enlistment. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> insists that `` no rules were broken'' in the way he entered the Guard. He says he was willing to serve in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> had his unit been called up, although he concedes that he was generally aware the likelihood of that happening was not great. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has been angered at implications that he was trying to avoid the draft, although he has tried to appear unperturbed throughout the controversy. Over the weekend, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> appeared not to hear some spectators' chants of `` Quayle, who went in your place?'' or to see signs reading `` This Quayle is a chicken.'' He seems to be philosophical about the most intense and public scrutiny of his meteoric political career. `` I'm in politics in what they call the big leagues,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> says, adding: `` Running for the vice presidency is a definite honor.''

 Foreign policy is getting very little attention from the candidates as the campaign gets started. The Republicans seem to be content to play vaguely on <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s experience, while the Democrats are saying even less Even so, the basic approach of the two parties is becoming clear. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, intend to sound the traditional conservative themes of a powerful military structure and keeping a wary eye on the Russians. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, are playing down ideology and playing up `` competence,'' being careful to strike a skeptical stance on the Soviets while sounding the peace theme. Both sides are bound to get more specific in the 2 -LCB- months of campaigning ahead. It's likely to get sticky. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be challenged about the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's secret arms sale to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' lack of foreign policy experience will be tested over a wide range of issues. Do n't look for foreign policy treatises, though. Campaigning for president in the television age encourages snappy or catchy one-liners, not a thoughtful exposition of how the candidates stand on tricky arms control issues, the <LOCATION> Arab-Israel </LOCATION> dispute, leftist movements in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and apartheid in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Besides, politicians and their managers operate on the theory the voters are far more concerned with pocketbook issues such as jobs and inflation than with American foreign policy. There have been striking exceptions and mixed results. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> ran for a fourth term as president in 1944 while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was still at war. The overriding issue was whether to take a chance on changing leaders. The voters stuck with <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>. In 1972, on the other hand, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate, ran primarily as an anti-war candidate whose opposition to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> involvement in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> was the central theme of his futile race against President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. The 1988 campaign is just now unfolding, but there is no reason to believe either the Republicans or Democrats will give that sort of weight to a single foreign policy issue. In fact, the selections of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> suggest the presidential candidates intend to place the focus elsewhere. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is above all a gesture to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s most conservative elements, while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> chose <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> primarily for his experience in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and his ties to conservative Democrats, especially in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. In 1960, when <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> was pondering a running mate for his first race for the presidency, he assembled 36 party elders at a midnight meeting in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The governor of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON>, offered this advice: `` You can say all you want about foreign affairs, but what is really important is the price of hogs in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> picked <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabot </PERSON> <PERSON> Lodge </PERSON>, who had served as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> permanent representative at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. They lost to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s explanation, as recalled by former Undersecretary of State <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>, may still be relevant: `` If you ever let the Democrats campaign only on domestic issues, they will beat us. Our only hope is to keep it on foreign policy.'' That does n't mean, however, that the candidate has to be an expert on the pecking order in the Kremlin, the history of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> or the strengths and weaknesses of the Nicaraguan economy. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> won in 1980 without any experience in foreign affairs. He lacked the background to be specific about foreign policy issues. But he had a well-developed image of opposing communism, and he relied on generalities whenever dealing with the Soviets _ the primary foreign policy issue of our time _ came to the fore. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is leaving office on an entirely different note. He has held four summit meetings with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and signed a treaty with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to scrap intermediate-range nuclear missiles. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, his vice president, is trying to capitalize on the improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations, suggesting he is far more capable than <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to maintain the momentum. The fact that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ like <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ was inexperienced when he ran for the presidency is not stopping <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> from questioning the credentials of his opponent.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Soviet-backed government was responsible for repeated attacks on civilian targets in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in 1987 and carried out well over half of all incidents of state-sponsored terrorism worldwide in that year, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report said today. The report, titled `` Patterns of Global Terrorism: 1987,'' was completed before the incident last Wednesday in which a Pakistani C-130 crashed, claiming the lives of President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON>, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wassom </PERSON> and 27 others. Pakistani officials believe terrorists were responsible and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Afghan agents have to be `` among the suspects'' because of the stepped up campaign Afghan authorities are alleged to be carrying out against <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The conflict between the two countries stems from Pakistani support for Afghan rebels based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> who are fighting the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s role as a haven for millions of Afghan refugees. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said Sunday that any comments on the cause of the crash would be speculative because investigators, including <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts flown to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, are just beginning their work. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> spoke at <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, where the remains of <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wassom </PERSON> were flown and a ceremony was held that included remarks by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>. Acting Pakistani President <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> said Saturday his government suspects last Wednesday crash was the result of sabotage. `` Judging from the circumstances of the tragedy ... enemies of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> are actively posing a threat to the security of our country,'' <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kriesburg </PERSON>, a senior associate at the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION>, said it would be a mistake to assume automatically that Afghan agents were responsible for the crash because <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> had many other enemies. They included some from within the Pakistani military and others who were alienated by his authoritarian rule. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report said <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> agents carried out 127 of the 189 incidents last year attributable to state-sponsored terrorism. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was second with 44 and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> followed with seven, the report said. All told, there were 832 international terrorist incidents last year. `` When the Pakistani numbers are subtracted, the number of incidents in the rest of the world declined by almost 10 per cent from 1986 statistics,'' it said. The report said the Afghan campaign had been largely limited to the northwest part of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> where rebel forces are based but spread to major cities last year. It said the campaign is being waged by the <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION>, known by the acronym WAD. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> said last November that the assassinations and bombings carried out against Pakistani civilians were `` at the behest of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'' but <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has denied the allegation. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Pakistani officials estimate that bombs planted by Afghan agents have killed more than 400 civilians in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The bloodiest incident occurred in July 1987 when three car bombs exploded in the main bazaar of <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>, killing 72 and injuring 260. The report said it is likely that the Soviets have been aware of Afghan operations in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> because of the close ties between WAD and the Soviet intelligence agency, <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>. It said that while some of the material for the explosive devices can be purchased on the black market, other items can be obtained only through Soviet sources. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> estimates that about 1,500 Soviet advisers work with WAD.

<HEAD>Lobbyists Spent $63 Million Trying to Influence Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Capitol Hill lobbyists paced by a controversial Social Security advocacy group spent more than $ 63.62 million trying to influence <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1987. The amount, compiled from required reports filed with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, represented a 4.5 percent increase from 1986, when a massive overhaul of the nation's income tax laws spurred big spending by registered lobbyists. The 1986 total of $ 60.87 million by some 8,500 individuals and organizations was up from $ 49 million in 1985 and at the time was the highest total since The Associated Press began compiling the figures in 1983. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to Preserve Social Security led the pack last year with a reported outlay of $ 2.93 million, much of it for direct-mail campaigns designed to flood congressional offices with letters from senior citizens. Headed by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, the son of President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Delano </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, the organization has drawn fire from members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who say it uses scare tactics to obtain contributions from the elderly. <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> has defended the lobbying group, saying `` our cause is a good one, our methods are honest, our concerns are sincere.'' The $ 2.93 million was slightly below the $ 3 million in lobbying expenses reported by the group for 1986, when it finished in second place behind the $ 3.02 million spent by Citizens for Sensible Control of Acid Rain. That group, bankrolled principally by electric utilities and coal companies, decreased its 1987 lobbying expenses to $ 1.2 million, leaving it in eighth place among nine organizations spending more than $ 1 million last year. Second spot in 1987 was occupied by perennial big-spender Common Cause, the self-described citizens lobby that concentrates on government ethics and election finance reform and attributes its entire budget to lobbying. Common Cause spent $ 2.56 million last year, just ahead of the $ 2.55 million reported by a tobacco company, <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, which used direct-mail campaigns to oppose any increase in federal excise taxes on tobacco products. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> spent about half its total in the final quarter of 1987. Its fourth-quarter outlay of $ 1.27 million was the highest by any lobbying group for a three-month period last year. The Committee to Protect the Family ranked fourth in overall spending last year with $ 1.95 million, followed by <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 1.5 million to support lobbying on environment and conservation issues The biggest spender among organized labor last year was the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Letter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carriers </ORGANIZATION> at $ 1.48 million. The other million-plus spenders were the Fiber Fabric and <ORGANIZATION> Apparel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> with $ 1.24 million and the <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recording </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> with nearly $ 1.18 million. The coalition, a consortium of audio component companies, has been battling on Capitol Hill for several years against the <ORGANIZATION> Recording </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, composed of record and tape manufacturers. The coalition's spending was far ahead of the $ 331,280 reported by the recording association in the struggle over whether <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will restrict use of or impose royalty fees on digital audio tape, the newest kid on the high-fidelity block. The continuing congressional debate over handgun control again accounted for heavy lobbying expenses, with a group pushing for firearms restrictions, <ORGANIZATION> Handgun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, leading spending in this area with $ 900,343. The pro-control forces were outgunned, however, by collective spending by their opponents: <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, $ 668,058; <ORGANIZATION> Gun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Owners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, $ 608,672; and <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, $ 271,435. Other large spenders last year included <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, $ 919,419; Project Cure, $ 909,018; Free the Eagle, $ 896,555; <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executives </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, $ 800,293; <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lobby </ORGANIZATION>, $ 765,329; and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, $ 728,803. Also, <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, $ 576,504; <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, $ 543,273; <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, $ 539,451; <ORGANIZATION> Man-Made </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fiber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 524,642; <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 513,281; and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, $ 512,671.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is emphasizing national campaign themes as he visits northeastern <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, a region the Democratic presidential nominee often cites when discussing his record of economic development. As he did during a visit to central <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> last week, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is kicking off the visit with a meeting attended by area elected officials, educators and business and labor leaders. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor also planned today to distribute grants for a new manufacturing research center and for improvements at the <ORGANIZATION> Middlesex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> campus in <LOCATION> Lowell </LOCATION>. From there, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was to attend an event to promote his Homeownership Opportunity Program, which provides state assistance to low - and moderate-income families looking to buy homes <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was to return to the northeastern corner of the state Tuesday for several more events. He frequently mentions the northeastern <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> communities of <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON>, both former mill cities, when discussing his efforts to spur economic development in economically depressed areas. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spent Sunday at his <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION> home, where he returned late Saturday night after a four-day campaign swing through parts of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. That trip started in the middle of the Republican National Convention and was part of a campaign effort to keep <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> visible during the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> gathering. Aides billed the trip as highly successful. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> revealed no new positions on issues but was widely covered in the national news media, particularly after <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s selection of Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as a running mate sparked controversy Questions have centered on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s use of his wealthy family's influence to help him join the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and avoid the draft at the height of the Vietnam War <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at virtually every stop indirectly criticized <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s judgment for choosing him. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> repeatedly discussed the lenthy <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> record of his own running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, telling crowds the `` true test'' of presidential leadership should be the quality of people selected to fill key positions. After spending today and Tuesday in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> plans to campaign Wednesday and Thursday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. He is scheduled to be back in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> on Friday and then back in the nation's capital Saturday to participate in a march marking the 25th anniversary of the civil rights march on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> led by <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>.

 Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has well-known differences with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> over Contra aid, the MX Missile and school prayer. But reporters covering his just-ended <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> swing found another one. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is a pedal-to-the-metal guy. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> fidgets at his driver when his car edges above <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' 55 mph speed limit. But the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator, told how long his entourage would take for a drive from <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> to Mission, revealed his motoring style. `` I'd make it a lot faster if the Secret Service were n't around,'' he said <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is a Texan who does n't like to waste time. He's up early, does his campaigning on schedule, and gets it finished on time, though that's sometimes late in the evening. His walk and his gestures, which seem stiff on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, make more sense in the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> summer sun. `` There's not a lot of wasted motion,'' observed one aide. And he's doing something on the road that reporters who cover him in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> almost never see. He's having fun. More often than not, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> strolls back to the press section of his plane and tell reporters of the last event: `` That was great.'' When the campaign jet goes nose-up on takeoff, the television crews bowl an orange up from the back of the plane. After a week of failed attempts, they scored by getting one into the cockpit. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who had been casually monitoring the progress of these efforts, grabbed the fruit and took out his pen. `` Aft-to-Cabin Award,'' he wrote, and he signed it, dated it, and rolled it back. The orange was mounted to the ceiling, where it hung as a trophy until the end of the trip Sunday night. Rarely quotable and known for his attention to detail in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> now seems to relish making those quick quips that ignite campaign rhetoric, and he's even cracking a few jokes. When reporters groaned about the length of the nine-day trip, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> smiled. `` I get time-and-a-half after five days,'' he said. Hearing that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the Republicans would fight like pit bulls, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> replied: `` There'll probably be enough bull to go around.'' At midweek, after Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> picked 41-year-old <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the 67-year <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was n't going to let himself be seen as the old man of the campaign. He increased the dumbbell weights for his morning treadmill exercise from four pounds to five pounds. `` It's not the miles on you, it's the depth of the tread,'' he said of the `` age gap.'' After a tedious session of satellite feeds in a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> television station, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> cleaned up and, emerging from his makeup, shouted, `` Hey, remember me. I'm the 41-year-old guy.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and his wife of 45 years, <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>, were together almost constantly, he always introducing her as `` B.A. _ that stands for <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s best asset.'' The former model would sometimes fuss over his hair if it was out of place. One morning in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the two campaigned separately until she rejoined him while he was doing some interviews. It took a moment for him to spot her. `` What a good lookin' woman you are _ are you spoken for?'' he exclaimed. Mrs. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> chats with reporters less frequently than the senator, but on one plane ride she was asked if she would mind a personal question. She seemed a little reluctant, but went along. Is it true, she was asked half-jokingly, that the senator has a body of a 41-year-old? She replied without hesitation. `` You bet. No question about it,'' she said. Always looking for a gaffe, reporters have found slim pickings in the veteran <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. One of his infrequent mistakes came when one attempt at humor seemed inappropriate. Asked about President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Strategic Defense Initiative, which promises to shoot down enemy nuclear warheads, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> expressed his doubts. If even one got through, he said, `` it will ruin your whole day.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> clearly was comfortable campaigning <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, his native state where he was first elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1970. His gave his stump speech in some of the hottest places on the planet, and usually he emerged looking fresh and crisp. It was so hot in a wool warehouse in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angelo </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s shirt was sticking to his body as he discussed the cattle business with local citizens But in a few minutes he was cleaned up and strolling to his next speech at a nearby park. The <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> entourage includes experts from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign to help advise him and coordinate the Democratic ticket. But when a herd of cattle charged and cut off the press bus at the <ORGANIZATION> LBJ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranch </ORGANIZATION>, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> people were stumped and guessed wildly when reporters wanted to know what they were. `` Oh, nonsense, they were just whiteface,'' declared <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who grew up on his father's ranch.

<TEXT>
 A Soviet rocket that plummeted to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> in northeastern <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> put on a spectacular light show for residents of the western and northern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but it was not all that unusual in other respects, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials say. The craft that crashed Sunday, causing no reported injuries or damage, was also not Cosmos 1900, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> spy satellite that has been drifting out of orbit for several months and arousing concern because it is nuclear-powered. The rocket had been launched last Thursday to boost a <ORGANIZATION> Gorizont </ORGANIZATION> communications satellite into orbit, said Maj. <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondragon </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Space Command, speaking from <ORGANIZATION> Peterson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>. The vehicle, which came down at about 1 a.m. EDT, was most likely an SL12, one of the most frequently used Soviet launchers, he said. The craft was tracked by officials at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surveillance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, where about 7,200 space vehicles are constantly being observed. An average of one space vehicle reenters the Earth's atmosphere each day, <PERSON> Mondragon </PERSON> said. `` It's not unusual for a rocket body not to stay in orbit,'' he said. `` There's nothing to keep it there.'' Cosmos 1900, launched last Dec. 12, is now expected to reenter the Earth's atmosphere in late September or early October, <PERSON> Mondragon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mondragon </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Maj. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> provided no further details about the craft's condition when it reached the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> or the precise location where it came down. <PERSON> Mondragon </PERSON> said it usually takes about 24 hours to pinpoint where downed satellites plummet to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. The spokesmen said the descending rocket was visible to residents of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. `` I do understand it was pretty spectacular,'' <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said. He said the downing of the craft, which he referred to as a `` non-nuclear Soviet rocket body,'' was expected by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. `` It was predicted it would come down, it came down as predicted and it came down where it was predicted,'' he said. <PERSON> Mondragon </PERSON> said officials do not try to recover parts of such rocket bodies because 95 percent of them usually burn up upon reentry. `` That spectacular light show that they provide folks with is the rocket body burning up,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dissidents Denounce 1968 Invasion of Czechoslovakia</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Prague Spring, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of Soviet bloc opposition activists urged their governments to denounce the Soviet-led invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> 20 years ago and rehabilitate those who were later purged. They also called on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to reveal `` missing facts'' about its role in the suppression of reform movements throughout <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The dissidents issued a statement Sunday signed by 115 people from 25 different organizations in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> was invaded Aug. 20-21, 1968, by troops from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other forces of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact alliance. They crushed reforms by <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s liberal Communist government, ending what is known as the `` Prague Spring.'' The dissidents' statement was released by <ORGANIZATION> Palach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, a London-based publication that monitors the Czechoslovak political scene. `` The leaders of the invading countries should publicly denounce the invasion 20 years ago,'' said the statement. It also said, `` Slandering of the ` <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Spring' should cease and the thousands who were expelled from political, cultural and scientific life should be rehabilitated. `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> should clarify not only missing facts about Soviet-Polish relations, but also its role in the suppression of -LRB- East -RRB- <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> workers in 1953, in the Hungarian uprising in 1956, in the suppression of the Czechoslovak democratization in 1968 and in the Polish coup d'etat in 1981,'' the statement said. The mention of a `` Polish coup'' referrred to the imposition of martial law in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in December 1981 and banning the next fall of the Solidarity free trade union movement. The invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> `` marked the victory of reactionary forces throughout the whole region, thus causing the present-day crisis of <LOCATION> East-Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' the statement said. `` It is the earnest wish of all our nations that the Soviet state keeps its promise and withdraws its troops from the occupied countries,'' it said. According to <PERSON> Palach </PERSON> <PERSON> Press </PERSON>, Soviets who signed the statement included <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Timofeyev </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glasnost </ORGANIZATION> and representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>. It said 13 Hungarian organizations, each represented by two people, signed the statement including writers <PERSON> Sandor </PERSON> <PERSON> Csoori </PERSON>, <PERSON> Istvan </PERSON> <PERSON> Csurka </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Haraszti </PERSON> and philosopher <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kis </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Administration Changes Tune on Farm Loan Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s business-and-industrial loan program has become a kingpin of the administration's rural development effort, helping finance projects from catfish plants to macadamia nuts Once despised by White House budget trimmers as something local communities and private citizens ought to do for themselves, the `` B & amp; I'' loans handled by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> have enjoyed new status in recent years. The financial battering of farmers in the early 1980s, the hardships that hit the economy of small-town <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and the insistent demands of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have helped jog the administration into a new look at rural development. For the fiscal year that began last Oct. 1, according to <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Aycock </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> B </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; I loan guarantees are expected to use the full $ 95.7 million authorized by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the second year in a row that has happened. According to FmHA records, the <ORGANIZATION> B </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; I volume soared to more than $ 1 billion in 1979-80 before winding down under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, which unsuccessfully for several years advocated elimination of the program. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s budget office in presenting proposals for fiscal 1984, for example, explained the reasons for seeking reduction or elimination of many of the FmHA community programs, including sewer and water assistance, and B & amp; I. `` Reductions in rural development program loans and grants reflect the administration's philosophy that private sector investment, not public sector pump priming, should drive development,'' the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The federal role in the rural sector will be limited to that of lender of last resort in providing water, sewer and community facilities essential to the health and safety of households where most needed in rural areas.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> reduced annual authorizations for B & amp; I in the early 1980s, and the administration kept the actual loan level far below that. In 1984, for example, when B & amp; I was authorized at $ 200 million, the actual lending level was held to $ 124 million. Lending dropped to $ 61 million in 1985 and to $ 55 million in 1986. Then in 1987, when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> set the authority for <ORGANIZATION> B </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; I at $ 95.7 million, the full amount was used for the first time during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Aycock </PERSON> said that as of this April the B & amp; I program had 2,238 loans outstanding for a total of $ 1.82 billion. Of those, 475 loans, or 21 percent, were delinquent, a total of $ 230 million. In its 16 years, the <ORGANIZATION> B </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; I program has provided more than 7,000 guaranteed loans totaling nearly $ 6 billion, according to the background information provided by <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> at the request of The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. B & amp; I was authorized by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1972 to provide loans `` for the purpose of improving, developing or financing business, industry and employment and improving the economic and environmental climate in rural communities, including pollution abatement and control.'' An example of the program's intent was a 1974 loan to <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, for $ 28.2 million to finance a new denim manufacturing plant in <LOCATION> Littlefield </LOCATION>, near the fields where cotton grew. Two more loans brought the total to $ 33.5 million. `` Jobs were created for more than 600 people, and a ready market was provided for Plains cotton,'' the agency said. `` It was made into high-quality denim, much of which was bought by <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> over the years. The loan was paid in full on Aug. 4, 1987.'' Some more recent examples include: _ $ 2 million for <ORGANIZATION> Fishco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Belzoni </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, to help build a catfish processing plant with a capacity of 40 million pound per year. The plant is expected to employ 432 people when running at full capacity. _ $ 2 million for <ORGANIZATION> Stoneville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Furniture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Stoneville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, to buy equipment and machinery. Funds also will be used for working capital. The plant employs approximately 700. _ $ 4.5 million for <ORGANIZATION> Fairmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Fairmont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, to buy and reopen a food processing plant, and to purchase new machinery and equipment to produce frozen processed foods. The project will create 234 jobs. The B & amp; I loan program over the years also has been used for cotton gins, the manufacture of radar `` guns'' used by police, a shrimp farm in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, a chicken processing, a radio station, automobile dealerships, and plants to make fuel-grade ethanol. As another recent <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> report described program operations, ventures `` range from the processing and marketing of coffee beans and macadamia nuts in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> to the manufacturing of equipment to convert solid waste to boiler fuel in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>.'' Under the recently enacted $ 3.9 billion drought-aid package, the <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> was ordered to use B & amp; I `` to the maximum extent possible'' to help businesses adversely affected by drought. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> included $ 200 million for guaranteed loans to rural businesses and organizations to recover from drought losses. Those loans will have a lid of $ 500,000 per individual.

<HEAD>Panama Says U.S. Harassment Charges Are Psychological Warfare</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> say charges that its troops are harassing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops are part of a psychological war designed to destabilize the government of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The statement released late Sunday said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials who reportedly accused the Panamanian government of deliberately sanctioning attacks on Americans `` must have the IQ of a 3-year-old Cro-Magnon.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in the Panamanian capital said Sunday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel have reported at least 240 incidents of harassment by Panamanian authorities this year, including attempts to extort bribes for traffic violations and the stoppage of mail. `` PDF -LRB- <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Defense Forces -RRB- members have been notably less courteous in dealing with our people,'' said an official at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> who spoke on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions aimed at ousting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who has been indicted by two federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges, were applied in March and have damaged <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s economy. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> said the harassment reports sought `` to destabilize <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and immerse it in chaos, an indispensible step for not fulfilling and to annul the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaties </ORGANIZATION>, and particularly to prolong the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence beyond the year 2000,'' when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has agreed to turn the canal over to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said Sunday that the reports of harassment are coming from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel. `` Civilians, business people and embassy personnel have reported no increase in harassment,'' she said. She said she was not sure whether <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel are being bothered more or are `` simply reporting more cases.'' The latest incident occurred when Panamanian officials blocked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trucks from picking up mail at <LOCATION> Torrijos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> for three days last week, a second Southern Command official said. The official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said the dispute was satisfactorily settled. A Panamanian official called the dispute a `` bureaucratic misunderstanding.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said 240 cases of harassment were reported from February to August: `` What's going on these days has been going on for months _ going way back to last year. `` One of the things that's happening is that a lot of people are being asked for bribes when they're stopped for traffic violations, and that's probably because the police are n't getting paid regularly,'' the official said. `` But if a case like that is reported, it goes down as harassment.'' The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday quoted <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, State and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials as saying there have recently been an increasing number of beatings, abductions, rape and extortion of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel and their dependents. The story, under a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> dateline, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials view the incidents as a campaign by the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime to pressure the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to lift economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. However, <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> officials disagreed with the reported motive and one official said the increased harassment `` could be just an indication of individual frustration and anger.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> statement said, `` The supposed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government officials -LRB- cited by the Times -RRB- must have the IQ of a three-year-old Cro-Magnon when they assert that actions taken by the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel are attempts to force the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to lift or soften economic sanctions imposed on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' The statement said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops cause daily problems for Panamanian authorities, including fights, mistreatment of women, venereal disease, shooting in public places and refusing to pay bar and restaurant tabs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions were applied after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> ousted President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> has since been in hiding, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continues to recognize him as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s legitimate president. About 12,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen are stationed in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> by treaty to protect the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, a vital waterway linking the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> oceans. They are attached to the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, which is in charge of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military operations south of the U.S.-Mexico border.

After a preliminary survey of the material this month, `` our historians tell us they have seen documents that have not been seen by Western eyes for the past 40 years,'' said <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lerman </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holocaust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lerman </PERSON> signed an agreement July 29 in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> which will allow <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> historians to photograph the documents for storage in the holocaust museum <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has authorized the council to build on the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Mall by 1991. The Soviets also will receive microfilm and microfiche copies of the documents, made at the expense of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> council. `` By microfilming and microfiching the documents we extend their shelf life for by at least 300 years,'' said <PERSON> Lerman </PERSON>. `` That's one of the things that turned them around.'' The Kremlin has long blocked Western and Soviet historians from viewing archives, including those from the period of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> occupation, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> historians attribute the shift to the reform policies of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` This is a 180-degree turn around in the attitude of the Soviet authorities,'' said <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilberg </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> historian who accompanied <PERSON> Lerman </PERSON> on his trip to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and reviewed documents in the Soviet capital and other cities. `` It's a humongous amount, oceans and oceans of material'' in three dozen archives administered by <PERSON> Glav </PERSON> <PERSON> Archiv </PERSON> for the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Lerman </PERSON>. The archives will not be opened to Soviets, said <PERSON> Lerman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hilberg </PERSON>. In the past, the Soviets have given the West piecemeal archival materials, such as the identification card that was crucial in the conviction last April of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>. He was sentenced to death in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for operating gas chambers at <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> camp in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> where hundreds of thousands died. <PERSON> Hilberg </PERSON>, who has been studying holocaust documents for 40 years, said the Soviet archives provide extraordinary detail of the day-to-day operation of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camps and the security forces under German occupation. `` The collaboration was much greater in areas held by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for brief periods of time'' before the war, `` higher in the west <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> than in the east, higher in the Baltic buffer states and eastern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Hilberg </PERSON>. Those areas were annexed by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under the secret provisions of a Nazi-Soviet treaty signed the month before <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in 1939, starting World War II. Material in the archives `` shows the transformation of the human psyche during the Nazi occupation,'' said <PERSON> Hilberg </PERSON>. `` The drastic nature of the German occupation was such that the effect on the population was dramatic. This was true not only of Jews who were killed, but those who watched it.'' In one document <PERSON> Hilberg </PERSON> reviewed in the Soviet archives, `` a German officer wrote that anti-Semitism was decreasing among Latvians in 1943'' after nearly all the Jews in that Baltic republic had been killed and the Soviets started to drive the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> out, said <PERSON> Hilberg </PERSON>. The Latvians, said <PERSON> Hilberg </PERSON>, `` saw they had thrown in their lot with the Germans, they virtually exterminated the Jewish population there, and then they had second thoughts'' as the Soviets turned the tide of battle. `` Altogether in this country we may have underestimated the extent to which people in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were subjected to the occupation. We might have had a different relationship with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> if we had known this. `` But the Soviets were secretive, apparently trying to hide the weaknesses of communism, and in some cases the degree to which people collaborated,'' he said. Photographing the documents might take about a year, and cost $ 1 million to $ 1.5 million, <PERSON> Hilberg </PERSON> said. The microfilm will be housed in the holocaust museum, a 200,000 square foot structure to be built adjacent to the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Printing </ORGANIZATION> and Engraving near the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Monument, for an estimated cost of $ 90 million raised from private donations. The holocaust council, consisting of 55 members appointed by the president and five each from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, plans to raise an additional $ 53 million as a permanent endowment for the museum, said spokesman <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Eshkenazi </PERSON>.

 A suspicious fire at a crowded social club killed seven and injured more than 30 as panicked patrons clawed against the walls and doors trying to flee, leaving those who escaped `` one step from death.'' Between 60 and 100 people were in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> club known as <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hoyo </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- The Hole -RRB- when the blaze ignited shortly after noon Sunday, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON>, a fire department spokesman. Five bodies were found inside the gutted club and two people died later, authorities said. Screaming patrons in the basement club fought for the lone exit, up a stairway where the fire apparently started, authorities said. Some broke through a rear wall and were pulled to safety by firefighters. Some who escaped joined bystanders in rushing back in to try to save others, getting in the way of firefighters and even grabbing their tools, firefighters said. `` It was sheer panic,'' said firefighter <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Fennell </PERSON>. `` It looked like people tried to claw out all of the walls.'' `` We had to break a door to get to the first floor. ... Then we had to break in the gate and some people helped from outside to open the gate,'' said <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Done </PERSON>, one of those who escaped. `` I was one step from death. I feel very lucky.'' `` All of a sudden I saw the flames come from the bar area. There was a lot of flames. It was very fast. All of a sudden, whoosh,'' said another patron, <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Delarosa </PERSON>, 32. Investigators were testing material from the basement for the presence of flammable liquid, according to <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON>, who said the fire was suspicious because it spread rapidly. Up to 150 firefighters battled nearly three hours to bring the fire under control. `` There was so much fire blowing out into the street that water did n't have any effect on it in the initial stages,'' said fire Capt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>. The club was in a low-ceiling, 50-by-75-foot basement of a row of stores and divided into smaller rooms. The bodies of four men and one woman were found toward the front of the club, <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said. He said one `` poor guy was found with his face in the wall like he was trying to crawl into a corner.'' There was no evidence of a posted license at the club, <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON> said. Taverns are prohibited in basements and there were n't enough exits to satisfy building codes, said Deputy Fire Chief <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. Firefighters were `` met by hysterical civilians streaming up the staircase,'' <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON> said. `` One firefighter told me he literally had to fight his way down the stairs.'' Most escaped through the club's small front door and narrow staircase, but others were able to break through a wall near the back, he said. A second door on the side of the club was locked shut, he said. Firefighter <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kisonas </PERSON> said hysterical people outside the club `` were trying to fight the tools away from us'' so they could re-enter and help others. Three patrons broke through a rear wall `` and our guys pulled them out of the rubble and gypsum board,'' <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON> said. Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, who toured the scene, described the club as a `` rabbit warren.'' `` It's clear that it should have never been opened in the first place,'' he said of the club. Most of the injured, including six firefighters and two <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> technicians, suffered smoke inhalation and were taken to hospitals, <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON> said. Sunday's fire was reminiscent of an Oct. 24, 1976, arson fire at a <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> social club that killed 25 and injured more than 30. Three men, including one who quarreled with a woman at the club, were convicted of setting the fire on the club's only staircase.

 A fire in the locomotive of an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> passenger train Sunday forced the evacuation of its passengers and blocked the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-Washington </LOCATION> rail corridor for four hours, an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> official said. The 172 passengers aboard an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metroliner </ORGANIZATION>, Train 123, were evacuated to a rear car about 8:10 p.m. with no injuries, said <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Marci </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>. Trains in both directions were backed up because power to the overhead electrical line that powers many trains on the heavily traveled corridor was cut to enable firefighters to battle the blaze, Ms. <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> said. With the fire still burning shortly after 11 p.m., power was restored briefly and about 10 trains that were backed up were allowed to move through, said Capt. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>. The tracks were closed again after midnight Sunday and were reopened more than an hour later, officials said. Firefighters remained at the scene at 2 a.m. Monday to clean up and to investigate the cause of the blaze, the <ORGANIZATION> Anne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arundel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. Morning traffic was expected to run normally today, <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Marciniak </PERSON> said.

 Oscar-winning actress <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> was in good condition after being hospitalized for irregular heart beat, and doctors were trying to determine if she suffered a heart attack or only altitude sickness. Miss <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, 87, had been visiting her son, actor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> MacArthur </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Crested </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Butte </LOCATION> when she became ill. She was flown the 100 miles from the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> town whose elevation is nearly 10,000 feet to <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> here `` She is very tired and really apprehensive about the media learning about her being here,'' <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, a nursing supervisor, said Sunday night. `` I really feel it was just the altitude that was bothering her,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tullius </PERSON> of Crested Butte. `` But she was sent to Grand Junction to confirm whether or not she had a heart attack. ... She had an irregular heart beat and it could be secondary to altitude.'' Grand Junction's elevation is about 6,000 feet. Miss <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> had attended the Republican National Convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> last week and `` had gone from a lower elevation to a higher elevation and her body would n't tolerate it,'' said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. The silver-haired actress ended her theater career in 1971, after 66 years, because of allergies to dust that aggravated her chronic asthmatic bronchitis. She has continued to work before the camera and is active in causes such as the rights of the elderly. She has won a <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>, two Oscars and an Emmy, and in 1981 received the Kennedy Center Honors for lifetime achievement.

<TEXT>
 About 400 workers carrying the Polish flag and chanting `` Solidarity'' marched through the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> shipyard to its main gate on Monday and proclaimed a strike, the yard's second this year. The outlawed free trade federation Solidarity had urged the shipyard's 10,000 workers to join a string of occupation strikes demanding union recognition and wage increases. At least 10 coal mines in southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and transit and dockworkers in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION> remained on strike on the seventh day of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s worst wave of labor unrest since 1981. At least 76,000 workers were idled. Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> offered Sunday to suspend his call for a <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> shipyard strike if the government agreed to talks on the labor strife. But the offer went unheeded. There was no sign of police interference as, 2 -LCB- hours after the day shift began, workers took over the main gate of the shipyard where Solidarity was born. In May, the yard was the scene of an 8-day strike that ended inconclusively. `` We warn the authorities that in case force is used against the striking workforce, the full responsibility for the consequences will lie with Polish authorities,'' strike leaders in <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION> said in a statement late Sunday. Police and riot troops were seen gathering around two <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION> shipyards which have not gone on strike, strike leaders said. They also patrolled the streets of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. Striking dockworkers in <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION>, fearing a police raid, said they had rolled cranes and other equipment to block the entrances to the port, which they have been occupying since Wednesday. Interfactory strike committee member <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Kowalczyk </PERSON> said at 6 a.m. that the night had passed without incident. In Jastrzebie, the center of the coal-mine strikes in the southwestern <LOCATION> Silesia </LOCATION> region, miners on Monday published the first edition of a strike newspaper and management and workers exchanged letters setting forth their positions on undertaking talks. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, speaking at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brygida </ORGANIZATION>'s church Sunday to about 3,000 union supporters, said authorities had approached him through unofficial channels about holding talks, but gave few details. He said he expected the government's reply to be delivered on the national television news Sunday evening. But the news, devoted mainly to the existing strikes across <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, carried no mention of <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and no hint about talks. Instead, the commentator suggested the strikes would continue. `` Tomorrow <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> will enter the second week of strikes, and we will continue estimating the losses for our economy,'' said TV news announcer <PERSON> Waldemar </PERSON> <PERSON> Milewicz </PERSON>. A spokesman in the government press office in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> also had no comment on <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s remarks. After watching the newscast at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brygida </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> brushed past reporters and went home, saying only that his earlier statements stood. Meanwhile, the Solidarity committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Nowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Huta </ORGANIZATION> steel mill outside <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> issued a statement Sunday calling on steelworkers to `` support strikers' demands at the proper moment.'' Solidarity, the first independent union in the Soviet bloc, was founded in the <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> shipyard in 1980. It was suppressed in a December 1981 military crackdown after massive strikes and outlawed the next fall. The government-controlled media has called the current strikes illegal and and stressed their rising cost to the economy. But it has made no clear statement on the government's plans. Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> met Saturday with top military leaders. The state-run <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency said they made `` appropriate decisions ... in connection with the present threats,'' but it was not known what they decided. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, told the crowd at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brygida </ORGANIZATION>'s that he wanted to avoid a strike. `` We can not pull <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> out of her troubles by means of strikes,'' he said. `` We are ready for dialogue and talks.'' Police barred priests from entering the July Manifesto mine in <LOCATION> Silesia </LOCATION> Sunday morning to say Mass, angering striking miners who had to listen over loudspeakers, but dockworkers were permitted religious services at the idled port in <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION>. At <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION>, the country's second-busiest port after <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, about 500 dockworkers attended a Mass, according to a strike committee spokesman reached by telephone. About 200 sympathizers and family members listened to the Mass from beyond the port gates. But at the coal mine in <LOCATION> Jastrzebie </LOCATION>, where the labor unrest began Tuesday, angry erupted when authorities barred two priests from entering. Strike leaders pleaded for 90 minutes for the clergymen to be let in as hundreds of strikers chanted, `` We want the priests. We want the priests.'' But when authorities would not relent, a makeshift altar made and the Mass was broadcast over loudspeakers to those inside. <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> claimed Sunday that `` the wildcat strikes are controlled by a narrow group of people who do not hide their political aims. It said several thousand miners had signed declarations that they want to return to work.

 An emaciated <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> broke bread to end his 36-day fast at an outdoor Mass but urged thousand of cheering supporters to continue his battle against <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> table grape growers. The 61-year-old union leader appeared gaunt and drawn Sunday as he was assisted to the Mass with his arms draped around the necks of his sons <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>. `` Today, I pass on the Fast for Life to hundreds of concerned men and women throughout <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the world who have offered to share the suffering,'' said <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> in a statement read by his eldest son, <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON>. `` The fast will go on in hundreds of distant places and it will multiply among thousands and then millions of caring people until every poisoned grape is off the supermarket shelves.'' After the Mass, <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, who lost 33 -LCB- pounds or 19 percent of his 174 pounds during the water-only fast, was taken from the union compound in this community 150 miles north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to an undisclosed location. He was to be put on a liquid diet, including light broth and non-citrus juices, that will last up to 10 days, said one of his physicians, Dr. <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>. It was not known if he would suffer long-term complications from the fast, which began July 17 and was his longest, but there were no plans to place him in a hospital, said <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, a vegetarian, began the fast in good health and remained mentally sharp throughout, she said. He endured stomach cramps, dehydration, vomiting, dizziness and other ailments in his effort to bring attention to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>' 4-year-old boycott of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> table grapes. The union said workers and consumers face a greater risk of cancer from the five pesticides used on <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> table grapes. But grape growers and grocers have said <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> and the union have unduly frightened consumers about the safety of table grapes in an effort to fight a political battle. The Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who sought this year's Democratic presidential nomination, began a three-day fast as <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> ended his. Other politicians and celebrities, including actors <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>, have promised to fast for two or three days as well. `` I'm here in a great tradition because <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> would have been here, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> would have been here. They can kill the dreamers but they ca n't kill the dream,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said.

 A 22-year-old aerospace engineering student from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> sat hunched over architectural drawings of a lunar base module, sketching the future of the final frontier. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fourier </PERSON>'s drawings wo n't stand as monuments to progress in space development. But where they were done just might. <PERSON> Fournier </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Toulouse </LOCATION> was one of 104 students from 21 countries including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> who assembled on the campus of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> this summer in the first session of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. They are scientists, engineers, policymakers and future astronauts with one thing in common: They dream of a global effort to explore and colonize space. Students attended 240 hours of lectures on subjects such as orbital space debris, international space law and problems of bone decalcification in space. The university, the first of its kind, wants to `` set forth an agenda for space exploration'' and create a `` coherent space culture,'' said <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON>, its 27-year-old co-founder. `` Over time there will be a global space culture and there has to be an understanding of what is possible on an international basis,'' <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON> said. In 1985, <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON> and co-founder <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Diamandis </PERSON>, also 27, formed the <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> to develop ideas for international space exploration. They raised $ 100,000 and came up with ideas including a university where people from around the world could learn from space experts. Since a founding conference at <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> in April 1987, <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Diamandis </PERSON> have raised more than $ 1 million from government, private and corporate sources, including $ 100,000 from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to enroll a 12-student delegation. About a third of the 350 students and professionals from around the world who applied for this year's course were accepted and their home countries paid the $ 10,000 fee `` We are the countries with the highest technology and we must cooperate,'' said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Prokhorov </PERSON>, 24, a graduate student at the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` All peaceful co-existence in space is a better alternative than -LRB- the Strategic Defense Initiative -RRB-. It's better to go to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> or Venus together.'' During the nine-week session that ended Saturday, students tested space shuttle suits, operated a robot that performed a simulated scavenging of the lunar surface, and built small lunar mining vehicles and tested them in sandboxes. The 84 lecturers from 14 countries were drawn from the world's top space organizations, including that <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cardiology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Satellite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> The point the university makes is that, with the decline of the American space program following the 1986 explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, the future development of space necessarily must be an international venture. `` There's no point in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> going to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> going to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Hannigan </PERSON>, 24, a spacecraft systems engineer with British Aerospace in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` It's a waste of national resources just to do national programs.'' `` Space programs are very expensive,'' added <PERSON> Fabola </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliveira </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, which is launching its first data collection satellite next year. `` As a developing country, we have no way of really going for space programs without international cooperation.'' The university will remain a summer school until 1992, when the founders hope to begin a five-year degree program with a permanent faculty, a main campus and satellite campuses at the world's top space centers. Next year's program will be in either <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON>'s dream of space involves everything from `` lunar and Mars development to solar-powered satellites to asteroid rendezvous and mining to building actual colonies in space.'' `` This is a 100-year vision,'' he said. `` We feel very strongly that that can happen.''

<HEAD>Homeless Advocates: Federal Government Should Fund Permanent
Housing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal government should help fund permanent, affordable housing programs to accommodate street people because emergency shelters have failed to curb the number of homeless, researchers said. The homeless should have access to the more affordable housing to ease dependency on crowded, understaffed shelters, according participants at a seminar Sunday at the annual meeting of the Society for the Study of Social Problems. The plan originally adopted by advocacy groups called for crisis services in emergency shelters, helping homeless people re-establish their lives, and supplying low-income housing for those who could live independently, said <PERSON> Madeline </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoner </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Work </ORGANIZATION>. But that plan did n't work because many homeless people have turned the temporary shelters into `` a permanent living situation,'' Ms. <PERSON> Stoner </PERSON> said. `` Shelters have not only failed to stem the growth of homelessness, their existence has served to perpetuate the homeless condition by keeping many in a transient state,'' she said. `` The three-tiered plan was a major mistake,'' said <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beaty </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> for the Homeless, an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> advocacy group. Advocates and agencies should turn from shelter-oriented services and concentrate on serving as many as possible at a low cost, actively recruiting businesses to improve employment opportunities and strengthening vagrancy and public nuisance laws, Ms. <PERSON> Stoner </PERSON> said. `` Any consideration of constructing a non-homeless future shifts the focus ... from shelters to explorations of permanent housing,'' Ms. <PERSON> Stoner </PERSON> said. The National Coalition for the Homeless estimates there are two to three million homeless people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ with women and children comprising about 60 percent. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> have the highest number of homeless people, with about 50,000 in each city, Ms. <PERSON> Stoner </PERSON> said.

 A cable car on a steep, damp hill above Fisherman's Wharf lost its grip and rolled backward, hitting a car and causing three minor injuries, officials said. The accident occurred on the <LOCATION> Hyde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> hill, about a block from a May 16 accident in which a runaway cable car hit a truck, injuring 36 passengers. On Sunday, the car carrying 25 to 30 riders was headed up the hill when it disengaged from the underground cable near <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, officials said. The gripman applied the regular and emergency brakes, but the car rolled backward into an automobile, which then hit a parked auto. The cable car slid down the hill for about 200 feet before stopping. Three passengers were treated for minor injuries at the scene, and the damage to the two cars was minor, officials said. The cable car was apparently undamaged.

<TEXT>
 Agents seized about 5,000 pounds of pure cocaine and $ 2 million in cash, including some stashed in bags marked `` Just Say No,'' authorities said in announcing one of the nation's largest drug confiscations Four people were arrested, including the local leader of a Colombian drug cartel, authorities said Sunday. The cocaine, with an estimated street value of $ 400 million, was the largest amount confiscated in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON>, special agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s office here. The largest cocaine shipment ever seized in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, on April 28, involved 9,230 pounds found in plastic containers that were concealed in hallowed-out lumber. The largest in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area occurred last month in <LOCATION> Hicksville </LOCATION>, where agents discovered 6,000 pounds of cocaine hidden inside blocks of chocolate from <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>. Only a few cocaine seizures nationally have exceeded 5,000 pounds. But Customs Service agents in 10 months have seized 10 tons more cocaine than they did in all of the last fiscal year, Customs Commissioner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said earlier this month. Among those arrested this weekend was <PERSON> Hernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Grajales </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizzo </PERSON>, 39, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, a leader in the <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION> drug cartel, <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON> would not say when or how the smugglers brought the drugs into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The drugs were found in the <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> apartment where <PERSON> Rizzo </PERSON> and two other men were arrested, officials said. The arrests were announced at a news conference where authorities displayed small plastic-wrapped boxes containing the 5,000 pounds of cocaine and boxes of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. Some of the money was in supermarket bags imprinted with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's slogan, `` Just Say No To Drugs.'' The arrests would likely cause the cartel to suffer a setback, but not end its activity in the lucrative <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> market, officials said. `` I hope it will have an impact, but the amount of the drugs coming in is very, very large,'' said Chief <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of the city Police Department's <ORGANIZATION> Organized </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. `` The problem is that a 2-pound, 2-ounce package, a kilo, can be broken down to about 14,000 vials of crack. That is our major problem.'' The suspects will be arraigned this week, authorities said.

<HEAD>Fragile Ties Between Jews and Arabs In Israel Unraveling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN IZENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Violent confrontations between Arabs and Jews inside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> have increased in recent weeks, threatening to unravel fragile ties that have bound the two groups through day-to-day contacts in the past 21 years. The incidents also prompt renewed concern that it will become more and more difficult to confine the Palestinian uprising to the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Two weeks ago, an arsonist set fire to a construction site shack in the <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> suburb Or <PERSON> Yehuda </PERSON>. Three Palestinians asleep in the shack burned to death. Police later arrested a 17-year-old Jewish suspect. On Sunday, police arrested seven Arabs on suspicion they threw three firebombs and a smoke bomb into the backyard of an Or <PERSON> Yehuda </PERSON> home. Also Sunday, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> resident Palestinian and his two sons were held on suspicion they hurled a hand grenade into a packed outdoor mall in the mixed Jewish-Arab city of <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION> on Saturday. The blast wounded 25 Israelis, including an 8-year-old boy whose feet were blown off. In another incident, three Palestinians from the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> were held on suspicion of trying to drown two Jewish women near a <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> beach. Also in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, a night watchman from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> told police he was beaten up by a gang of seven Jewish youths while guarding a construction site last week. As the violence increases, so does the hatred between the two communities. `` If we do n't manage to control the situation, things might get worse,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Yigal </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. `` The things happening now are not so unusual.'' The national police force, already overextended because of Jewish-Arab violence in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and the northern <LOCATION> Galilee </LOCATION> area with its large Arab population, had to deploy reinforcements in Or <PERSON> Yehuda </PERSON>. But their presence has not calmed the hatred. `` So what if an Arab burned to death,'' <PERSON> Shuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Calif </PERSON>, 16, told the Israeli Hadashot newspaper. `` What's an Arab anyway. He is n't human Let 2,000 more of them burn to death.'' Many Palestinians have absorbed the message. Before Dec. 8, when the uprising began, 105,000 Palestinians from the occupied lands worked in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, most of them commuting to their jobs each day. Today the figure has dropped to 85,000, and many of those still working in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> are worried and angry. `` I was frightened when I heard about the three workers who were burned to death,'' 25-year-old <PERSON> Issam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON>, an aluminium factory worker from <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` I was picturing myself in their place, which is very possible these days.'' <PERSON> Wael </PERSON> <PERSON> Yahyah </PERSON> <PERSON> Nafeh </PERSON>, 27, from the Kalandia refugee camp, said <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> workers have always faced problems in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` It's nothing new to me,'' said <PERSON> Nafeh </PERSON>, who has worked for the Israeli-owned Sonol gas company for the past six years. `` We have been threatened since we were born. ... Only nowadays they do n't do you the honor of threatening, but kill or beat you straight away.'' Legislator <PERSON> Amnon </PERSON> <PERSON> Linn </PERSON>, an Arab affairs expert in the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, denied Jewish violence against <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> was widespread. `` They are marginal groups on the fringes of Israeli society,'' <PERSON> Linn </PERSON> said of the Jewish assailants. But he warned the situation could deteriorate because of incidents like Saturday's grenade attack in <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>. `` If there is more of the same, more wounded, and if it should emerge that an Arab from <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION> was involved, it will lead to tensions and it will be hard to predict what might happen,'' said <PERSON> Linn </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>'s population of 243,000 includes 20,000 Arabs who hold Israeli citizenship. In contrast with other areas of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, many live in mixed neighborhoods with Jews. <PERSON> Maryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Meir </PERSON>, the father of two young boys seriously wounded in the <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION> blast, denounced violence from either side. `` I do n't know who threw it, Jews or Arabs, but whoever threw it is below any level of humanity because whether there's a political problem or not, he directed the grenade, and I saw this, toward my children,'' <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. Most of the violence in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> so far has involved Jews and Palestinians from the lands seized from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in 1967. But officials fear it could spread to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 735,000 Arab citizens. `` I hope the Jewish sector realizes the grenade attack was carried out by three or four people, not an entire community,'' said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Bligh </PERSON>, deputy adviser to Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> on Arab affairs. `` However, we are concerned about the possibility of further acts of violence by Jews against Arabs.''

 The Duke and Duchess of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> named their two-week-old daughter <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, Buckingham Palace announced today. The baby, who is fifth in line to the throne, will be known as Her Royal Highness The Princess <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the palace said. She is the first child of the former <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, the second son of Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s newest princess is currently at <LOCATION> Balmoral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION>, the queen's summer home in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, with her parents and grandparents. She was born Aug. 8, 1988 at 8:18 p.m., considered one of the luckiest moments of the century by <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> astrologers, and flew to <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> hours after leaving <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> with her parents on Aug. 12. The name <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> _ which means bringer of joy _ has royal roots. The youngest of Queen <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON>'s nine children was named Princess <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON>. While the duke and duchess were deciding on a name, British gamblers had a few ideas as well. But their top favorites, <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Annabel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, all turned out to be losers. The tabloid Sun, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s largest-circulation paper, hit the mark last Friday with a front-page banner headline revealing all three of the baby's names correctly. The paper said <PERSON> Annabel </PERSON> was <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>'s first choice but the name was rejected by the queen as `` too yuppie.'' It said the queen suggested the name <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> during a family gathering at <LOCATION> Balmoral </LOCATION>. `` It was agreed to be the perfect compromise _ unusual enough to please <PERSON> Fergie </PERSON>, but royal enough to please the queen,'' The Sun said. Princess <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON>'s second name, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, is after her grandmother, the queen, and her great-grandmother, Queen <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, who just celebrated her 88th birthday. The baby's third name, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, is the middle name of the duchess' mother, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrantes </PERSON>, wife of Argentinian polo player <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrantes </PERSON> It is also the name of <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>'s great-grandmother, <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, wife of King <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taking </PERSON> two weeks to choose a name is not unusual in the royal family. The queen's daughter, Princess <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> and her husband <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> took more than three weeks to name their son, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>, and almost four weeks to name their daughter, <PERSON> Zara </PERSON>. Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> were comparatively quick to name their children. Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON>, who is second in line to the throne behind his father, was named eight days after his birth and his younger brother, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>, who is third in line, was named after 24 hours. But <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> himself was referred to as the `` infant son'' for about a month after he was born on Nov. 14, 1948. His name was announced the day before his christening on Dec. 14 of that year.

 South and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> were deadlocked today after a third round of talks on a non-aggression agreement and the Olympics, with no word on whether negotiations will resume. During their two-hour meeting the two sides again refused to make any major changes in their positions and blamed each other for blocking progress. The communist north is demanding to be a co-host of the Olympic Games, while the south insists the north drop its demand and take part in the Games in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, which begin next month. Park Joon-kyu, the South Korean chief delegate, indicated there may be no further talks until after the Olympics. He said that after the talks he asked for a private meeting with <PERSON> Chon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kum </PERSON> <PERSON> Chol </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> delegation, to try to resolve the differences. `` If there is no hope we will postpone the next meeting until after the Olympics,'' he told reporters before the North Koreans failed to respond to the south's request for the meeting. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s delegation withdrew to consider <PERSON> Park </PERSON>'s proposal but did not respond by the set deadline and the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> delegation returned to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. The five-member delegations of lawmakers from each side met in the North Korean building at the <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> truce site straddling the Demilitarized Zone dividing the two sides. Earlier meetings were held Saturday and Friday. <PERSON> Chon </PERSON> accused the south of blocking progress. `` <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s attitude is anti-unification. Their direction and way of thinking is mistaken,'' he told reporters. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> called for urgent talks to be held in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> from Aug. 29 to focus solely on trying to resolve the Olympic issue while there was still time. The Olympics begin Sept. 17 and Sept. 2 is the entry deadline for athletes. The two Koreas, technically still at war, are archenemies with hundreds of thousands of troops poised along the 150-mile border in a state of constant tension. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is demanding to co-host the Olympics, and wants immediate talks involving the full legislatures of both sides to draw up a non-aggression declaration. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, which has said co-hosting of the Games is impossible, wants talks involving select parliamentary delegations. The south also wants to discuss a larger range of issues. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has said it will boycott the Olympics if it is not allowed to co-host the Games. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> fears the north may use terrorism to disrupt the Games if it is not allowed to co-host. The International Olympic Committee says <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> can not co-host the Games because they are awarded to a single city. The Korean peninsula was divided at the end of World War II. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> invaded the south in 1950 to start the Korean War, which ended in stalemate in 1953 without a peace treaty being signed.

 The Palestinian guerrilla group led by <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> today claimed responsibility for a grenade attack that injured 25 people in the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> port city of <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>. Also today, the army said a Palestinian died of wounds sustained in an overnight clash with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops that left four other Palestinians wounded. Arab reports said Palestinians stayed off the job for a second day to protest Israeli tax raids. In the northern city of <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>, police on Sunday announced the arrest of four <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> suspected of hurling a grenade at a crowded sidewalk cafe Saturday night. Twenty-five people were wounded. The Palestinian guerrilla group led by <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> claimed responsibility for the attack. The claim came in a statement from his <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> faction, published in the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> independent newspaper An-Nahar. The statement dedicated the attack to <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, also known as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON>, the military commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> who was assassinated in a suburb of <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> in April. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials have privately acknowledged killing <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Meir </PERSON>, 8, was the most seriously injured in the grenade attack. Both his feet were amputated and he suffered head wounds. Officials at <LOCATION> Al </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ittihad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> identified the Palestinian who died in the overnight clash as <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharnobi </PERSON>, 22, of Askar refugee camp. They also said three were injured. He was the third Palestinian fatality since Sunday and the 252nd in violence since Dec. 8, when Palestinian revolted against two decades years of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Four Israelis have been killed. A military spokesman said violence erupted after security forces entered the <PERSON> Askar </PERSON> camp `` for initiated operations'' aimed at preventing riots during the strike. The spokesman refused to elaborate. Arab news reports said the injuries came when plainclothes security agents opened fire after activists warned Palestinians through loudspeakers that Israelis were in the camp. After the incident, soldiers imposed a curfew on Askar, two neighboring refugee camps and the city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the army said. The restrictions confined about 140,000 people to their homes. The Palestinian general strike was called in leaflets issued earlier this month by the underground <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> of the Uprising. It shut down public transportation and shops in Israeli-annexed <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and major cities in the occupied territories including <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> news reports said. Near <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, a group of 17 masked Palestinian youths gathered on the Hebron-Jerusalem highway and stoned dozens of Arab cars carrying workers to jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, forcing them to turn back. <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> Haitham </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamad </PERSON> saw 14 cars with windows smashed stopped along the highway near the Dheishe refugee camp. Leaflets said the strike was to protest <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s confiscation of the property or restriction of movement of Arabs who refused to pay taxes. Tax boycotts have been a main element of the Palestinian revolt against Israeli rule. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has deported 33 Palestinians since the beginning of the uprising and an army spokesman said recently that about 5,500 Arabs have been jailed, many without trial under administrative detention orders.

<HEAD>New Pub Hours For England and Wales</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By AUDREY WOODS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pubs and bars throughout <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> will be allowed to stay open through the afternoon starting today, ending a 73-year-old policy and arousing some fears of increased drunkenness and violence. Pubs, clubs and hotel bars may now stay open on weekdays from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. instead of closing between 3 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. Sunday afternoon hours have been extended by one hour, from noon until 3 p.m. In 1915 the government decreed the afternoon closing to curb drinking by munitions workers. Parliament voted overwhelmingly in April to do away with the old rules. But pubs do not have to change their hours if they do not want to, and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Licensed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victuallers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> predicted that almost half the 67,000 pubs in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> would stick to the old ways. Most back-street and country pubs will probably continue to call `` time'' on weekdays at 3 p.m. The <ORGANIZATION> Brewers </ORGANIZATION>' Society predicted at least 25,000 new jobs would be generated by the longer drinking hours and that pubs would win back lost trade from hamburger and pizza bars. Pub owners and brewers agree that pubs in seaside and tourist towns and city bars will benefit most from increased trade. Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said: `` I believe that the new licensing hours will benefit society as a whole by giving people greater freedom of choice. Most people drink sensibly and responsibly and it makes no sense to deny them the opportunity to enjoy a drink in the afternoon at the time they wish.'' The government has faced stiff opposition from the health lobby and critics who fear that drink-related crime, particularly drunken violence by young rowdies and drunk driving, will increase. But champions of the new hours point out that extended hours in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, introduced over a decade ago, were followed by a reduced incidence of drunkenness and violence. The Scottish Office said licensing changes had little impact on alcohol abuse. In <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> most pubs increased alcohol sales during the past year, in which pubs were allowed to open on Sundays for the first time and open until later on weekdays. But pub owners say there has been no increase in hooliganism and drunkenness. <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> has had all-day opening from Monday to Saturday since 1922. The possible impact on the home has not been overlooked by the press. The Sunday Mirror ran a tongue-in-cheek story this week predicting that the extra drinking hour on Sunday threatened `` to shake the fabric of British family life.'' Wives preparing Sunday dinner can no longer `` even pretend to believe the man who tells you that he's just popping out to post a letter @ take the dog for a walk.''

<HEAD>Government Bans Anti-Conscription Organization</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government today banned a nationwide organization opposed to conscription laws requiring white men to serve in the armed forces. Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>, acting under state-of-emergency regulations, said the End Conscription Campaign was banned from carrying out any activities. Action against the organization was expected since 143 young white men, in the broadest challenge ever of the conscription system, announced Aug. 3 that they would refuse to perform mandatory military service. Most of the men face six-year jail terms. Leaders of the End Conscription Campaign denied involvement in organizing the mass resistance, but Defense Minister <PERSON> Magnus </PERSON> <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> said he held the group responsible for the `` subversive action.'' The organization appealed unsuccessfully for a system of alternative, non-military service for men politically or morally opposed to joining the army. It has argued that no one should be forced to serve involuntarily in the army units that patrol black townships or in the forces combating pro-independence guerrillas in <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>, in a statement, said the End Conscription Campaign's primary purpose was to undermine public support for the armed forces `` The <ORGANIZATION> ECC </ORGANIZATION> attempts to create an impression of political neutrality,'' <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said. `` But it is not difficult to see the organization's role in the revolutionary onslaught against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' The End Conscription Campaign was formed in 1983, and many of its members were detained or restricted since a national state of emergency was declared in June 1986. In February, the organization said it suspected army involvement in a harassment campaign that included anonymous telephone calls, smear pamphlets and vandalism of members' property. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s conscription laws allow conscientious objection only for religious reasons, not on political or moral grounds. Only whites are subject to conscription _ military service for other races is voluntary. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said the End Conscription Campaign's effort had been endorsed by the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the outlawed guerrilla group waging a sabotage and bombing campaign aimed at ending apartheid and overthrowing the South African government. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> also said the End Conscription Campaign had assisted draft dodgers, helping them obtain residence permits to live in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The government no longer disclosed how many men refuse to serve in the military. In 1985, the last year figures were disclosed, 7,589 men declined to serve. The ban on the End Conscription Campaign is similar to bans imposed in February on 17 anti-apartheid organizations. Under the bans, the organizations are allowed to exist in name only. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

 A handgun found next to the body of President <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> <PERSON> Salii </PERSON> had been given to him four months earlier at his request by a member of his security team, authorities said. `` I do n't know why he requested it,'' presidential aide <PERSON> Bonifacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Basilius </PERSON> said Sunday. <PERSON> Salii </PERSON>, 54, was found with a single gunshot wound to the head in the living room of his home on Saturday, a day before he was scheduled to announce his candidacy for re-election. He was pronounced dead about an hour later. He was the second president of the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> island republic, and the second to die by gunfire within three years. `` We're not ruling out anything,'' <PERSON> Basilius </PERSON> said when asked if the shooting was murder or suicide. <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION>'s chief medical examiner, Dr. <PERSON> Hee </PERSON> <PERSON> Yong </PERSON> <PERSON> Park </PERSON>, planned to assist in an autopsy tonight of <LOCATION> Salii </LOCATION> to determine if the fatal shooting was a suicide or assassination.

<HEAD>AIDS Victim Ryan White Appears in Movie On His Life</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL NOWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STATESVILLE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Teen-age AIDS victim <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> sat at his kitchen table back in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> with a couple of Hollywood film makers, eating pizza and reading a new movie script about his celebrated fight to return to school. At one point, <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> recalled, director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzfeld </PERSON> asked him to read the part of another young AIDS victim who had befriended him while they were in the hospital. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> did n't know it, but he was auditioning for the role. He got it. `` He's a natural,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Otto </PERSON>, co-executive producer of `` The Ryan White Story,'' an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> movie starring <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> which is being filmed in <LOCATION> Statesville </LOCATION> through Sept. 9. To <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, his small role in the film reinforces the message that AIDS can not be transmitted through casual contact. `` It tells the story, plus it helps educate people about AIDS and the hardships people go through,'' he said in an interview Friday. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> will appear as an older hemophiliac who, like <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, contracted AIDS from a blood transfusion. `` He did n't have a very positive outlook,'' <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said about his friend who died from the disease. The film will not depict <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>'s death The role of <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> is being played by <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> <PERSON> Haas </PERSON>, who starred opposite <ORGANIZATION> Harrison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> in `` Witness.'' <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Light </PERSON> of `` Who's the Boss?'' stars as <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON>. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> plays the part of the family's attorney, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON>. The softspoken <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said it has n't been difficult to work on a movie about his struggle with a deadly disease and the anguish his family went through in 1985 when residents of his native <LOCATION> Kokomo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, wanted to keep him from entering school. `` It's kind of weird seeing someone else playing my life,'' he said with a smile Friday at the <LOCATION> Iredell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Courthouse </LOCATION>, where the court scenes depicting the Whites' legal battles were being filmed. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> is 16 now but looks younger because of his small size. Slouched back in his chair, he looks like any other teen-ager with his untied high-top sneakers and close-cropped haircut. He is, however, far from typical. `` He never feels sorry for himself,'' Ms. <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> said. `` And he does n't want anyone else to feel sorry for him. I've learned so much from being around him.'' The movie will describe some of the legal and other battles the family went through since <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> contracted AIDS in 1984. It follows his attempts to return to school, a controversy that divided the residents of <LOCATION> Kokomo </LOCATION> and forced the Whites to eventually leave town. The film ends with <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>'s first day of classes at <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arcadia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> was scheduled to fly back home to <LOCATION> Cicero </LOCATION> early in the week so he can be ready for the start of school. Until then, he will continue to hang around the set. `` The crew is in love with him,'' Ms. <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> said. While the movie's focus is a young boy with a fatal disease, it also is a testimony to his vigor and spirit. `` This is not a story about a boy dying of AIDS,'' Ms. <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> said. `` It's the story of a boy living with AIDS and how a town was polarized by it. It's a microcosm of what it was like in this country three years ago, and, to some extent, what it's still like now. `` This is not a movie about a family's tragedy,'' she said. `` It's a family miracle. I'm totally inspired by having known the Whites.''

 A new edition of <PERSON> Upton </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>'s `` The Jungle,'' an expose of squalid conditions in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> stockyards, will restore whole chapters cut to make the book more marketable, a book historian says. <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> cut his original manuscript by a third for the 1906 Doubleday, Page edition which caused meat sales to slump and spurred President <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> to order an investigation that led to the nation's first Pure Food and Drug Act. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> DeGruson </PERSON>, a professor and curator of rare books at <LOCATION> Pittsburg </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, was quoted in today's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> as saying that, considering the material that was expunged from the original, `` it's amazing that the published book had any impact whatsoever.'' `` Despite his protestations that he wished the novel published as he had written it, revision was drastic,'' <PERSON> DeGruson </PERSON> wrote in the introduction to the new edition, due in October from <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luke </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, Tenn Most of the deletions pertained to socialism, but paragraphs criticizing the press and derogatory comments about `` big business,'' self-made men, captains of industry and marriage also were deleted. <PERSON> DeGruson </PERSON> said he pieced together the original novel from a truckload of rotting paper given to him in 1980 by a young man who had been hired to clean out the cellar of a nearby farm. The original novel had been serialized in a weekly newspaper, The Appeal, but the special edition that contained the final eight chapters and the conclusion had been lost until DeGruson found it among the papers from the farm. <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> died in a <LOCATION> Bound </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, nursing home in 1968 at the age of 90 _ one year after he returned to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to watch President <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> sign the Wholesome Meat Act, an expansion of the bill his book inspired.

<TEXT>
 About 400 workers carrying Polish flags and chanting `` Solidarity'' seized control of the Lenin shipyard today, joining a wave of strikes that poses the most serious challenge to communist authorities since 1981. The Lenin shipyard became the 13th enterprise in a week to go on strike for higher pay and government recognition of Solidarity, the trade federation that was suppressed under martial law in 1981. At least 10 coal mines in southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and transit and dockworkers in <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION> remained on strike on the seventh day of the labor unrest, which has idled more than 76,000 workers. Some <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> port workers also were striking as of today, according to reports from Western journalists. A Solidarity spokesman, <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON>, said 3,000 <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> dockworkers were on strike. Aside from the shipyard, which employs 10,000 people, no new strikes were confirmed by authorities today. But there were many opposition reports of labor unrest nationwide. Activists in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> reported an attempt to start a strike at the 14,000-worker <ORGANIZATION> Ursus </ORGANIZATION> tractor plant outside the city. A rally at the plant was dispersed by police during the morning shift, resulting in three detentions, said activist <PERSON> Maciej </PERSON> <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON>. But he said workers laid down tools in some departments. A management spokesman at Ursus who did not give his name confirmed an unsuccessful attempt to strike at the plant, but made no mention of police and said work continued normally. In southeastern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, Solidarity organizer <PERSON> Ewa </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuberna </PERSON> said workers rallied at the 18,000-employee <ORGANIZATION> Stalowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wola </ORGANIZATION> steel mill and heavy machinery plant, and a strike was launched by 2,000 of the workers. Government spokesman <PERSON> Ryszard </PERSON> <PERSON> Straus </PERSON> said people might be standing around at <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION> but it did not necessarily mean a strike. Opposition spokesman <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Maziarski </PERSON> also reported new strikes or partial strikes at the Cegielski turbine works in <LOCATION> Poznan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Warszawa </LOCATION> steel mill in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> and the Railroad Construction Enterprise of <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION>. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Huta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warszawa </ORGANIZATION> mill, technical director <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Zalesny </PERSON>, said about 50 people tried to mount a strike but it failed. <PERSON> Straus </PERSON> said he had no information about any stoppages at <LOCATION> Cegielski </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION> railroad enterprise. There was no police interference as workers marched around the <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> shipyard carrying Polish national flags and took over the main gate at 8:35 a.m. Late this morning, however, riot police cordoned off approaches to the shipyard. Strikers chanted Solidarity slogans and posted strike banners on the shipyard fence, helping some supporters who had been locked out to scramble over the gate. A short time later, Solidarity national chairman <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> arrived. `` We must fight for reforms. We must fight for Solidarity. There is no other way,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> exhorted strikers in a 20-minute rally at the gate. `` Everything is closed and the whole shipyard is on strike,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said later by telephone from his <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> home. He said the enthusiasm of the young strikers surprised him. `` This youth we have there is just incredible.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> blamed the strikes on authorities, whom he said have refused to engage in dialogue with workers. `` I wanted to avoid strikes,'' he said. `` We should n't be striking. We should be working. But there was no other choice. ... We are still waiting for serious talks.'' None of the shipyard's towering cranes appeared to be operating, and a foreman speaking through a fence stated that all departments were shut down. Workers could be seen strolling, taking naps or perching on fences and walls around the yard. <PERSON> Straus </PERSON> confirmed that the government considered the shipyard on strike. `` If you work only eight hours a day, you make 40,000 zlotys -LRB- $ 89 -RRB- a month, and that's not enough to make a living,'' said one man in his mid-20s, asked why he joined the strike. The shipyard, where Solidarity began eight years ago this month, also was the scene of a strike in May that ended inconclusively. In <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, striking workers generally go to their plants but do not work. Not since the labor unrest that led to the 1981 military crackdown on Solidarity have authorities had to confront strikes on such a scale. Wages are lagging far behind 60 percent inflation, which is aggravated by average 40 price increases. The government-controlled media has called the strikes illegal and stressed their rising cost to the economy. Coal is <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s leading export and a major source of hard currency to service its $ 39 billion foreign debt The government, which has refused to negotiate with Solidarity, has not stated how it intends to deal with the strikes. Solidarity, only independent labor federation ever allowed in the Soviet bloc, was founded in the <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> shipyard in 1980 after a nationwide strike wave. It was outlawed in October 1982. Labor unrest stemming in part from government price increases have three times toppled governments in communist post-war <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>: in 1956, 1970 and 1980.

 Hundreds of thousands of people rallied today in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> to demand an end to authoritarian rule, and heavily armed soldiers stopped protesters from marching across the capital of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, diplomats and news reports said. In the northern city of <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION>, hundreds of thousands of people, including housewives and children, filled the streets in response to student calls for a nationwide protest and a general strike, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> news service said. Some protesters waved the fighting peacock flag used in the struggle for independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in the 1940s. Many train and bus operators joined the strike, bringing public transportation to a halt, the report said. Soldiers closed off key areas of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> and stopped thousands of demonstrators from marching there, witnesses and diplomats said. An Asian diplomat said about 20,000 people heeded student calls and rallied outside <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in the largest demonstration in the capital since rioting culminated in the resignation of President <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> on Aug. 12. There were no reports of violence today in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> was replaced by President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, the country's first civilian leader in 26 years <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> reported from <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> that a group of protestors rallied in front of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, saying: `` We want our movement to be communicated to countries around the world.'' The protesters are demanding an end to one-party rule in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. In the southern city of <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border, thousands of demonstrators marched to the town hall, chanting slogans condemning one-party rule, a senior <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> police official said. Rebels fighting the government threw their support behind the students. The <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> diplomat said the demonstrators gathered peacefully in downtown <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. He said most shops in the capital were open in the morning, despite student calls for a nationwide general strike, but closed as the rally began. The diplomat, who demanded anonymity, said about 10,000 demonstrators remained outside the hospital early tonight. `` When about half of those taking part in the rally set out to march, they were blocked by soldiers,'' he said by telephone. The diplomat was not sure how the marchers were turned away. A Burmese source reached by telephone in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> said soldiers closed off parts of the city with barbed wire and other barricades, evidently to block any mass marches. The source, who requested anonymity, said thousands gathered peacefully in front of <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, listening to speeches by protest leaders, and the numbers were increasing steadily. The Thai police official said 10,000 demonstrators gathered at <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, some with red cloths tied around their heads as a symbol of defiance. The market town is in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s southernmost province of <LOCATION> Megui </LOCATION> bordering <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ranong </LOCATION> province, and is 490 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. During the Aug. 8-12 rioting, security forces there turned against the government and gave protesters free reign, <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> officials said. Also today, the <ORGANIZATION> Karen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, one of the strongest rebel groups, issued a statement in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> declaring support for the students and calling on foriegn nations to halt aid to the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> government until it ends one-party rule. Rebels hold large areas bordering <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. Last week, <LOCATION> Brang </LOCATION> Seng, a leader the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> grouping 10 guerrilla armies, also declared the front would join the students fighting for democracy. On Friday, <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, the Western-educated attorney general, succeeded <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> and became the nation's first civilian leader since a 1962 military coup toppled an elected government and instituted one-party rule. But students and other groups were not satisfied and immediately called for more demonstrations and the general strike today to press demands for multi-party democracy. Diplomats in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> say the government is highly unlikely to give in to such demands. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> has been in turmoil since September, when university students rioted in the most serious student unrest in the country since 1974. They were protesting the government's voiding of some 60 percent of the currency in circulation, a move that brought severe hardship in a nation where the per capita income of less than $ 200 a year is among the world's lowest. Bloody rioting, increasingly focused on political demands, occurred in March and June, leading to the resignation of Ne Win. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> is said to have personally ordered the suppression of those protests. Under Ne Win, the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> pursued ruinous policies of rigid socialism, strict military control and international isolationism. Security forces have not interferred with the demonstrations and after <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>'s departure, authorities have indicated they will be much more tolerant of dissent.

<HEAD>Couple Finds Last Works Of Sculptor Douglas Tilden</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELMONT, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A couple who paid $ 100 for a stack of sealed boxes at a grab bag auction believes they have uncovered one of the most exciting finds in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> art history. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> and <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Liberati </PERSON>, who bought the crates on an impulse at a <ORGANIZATION> Bekins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Van </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Storage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, auction, found they contained 70 plaster-of-paris statues, paintings, sketches and other works by artist <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tilden </PERSON>, a sculptor who died in obscurity after capturing international acclaim at the turn of the century. The couple, who indicated they hope to sell the collection, had no idea what was in the boxes when they bought them last spring at an auction. `` I thought they were tool boxes,'' <PERSON> Liberati </PERSON> said Sunday. Inside were casts of statues of historic figures including Father <PERSON> Junipero </PERSON> <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> and dozens of diplomas and prizes all bearing the name <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tilden </PERSON>. The next day, <PERSON> Liberati </PERSON> went to the public library and discovered that <PERSON> Tilden </PERSON> died broke and forgotten in his <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> studio in 1935 after winning international fame for his monumental public sculptures, including the Mechanics Monument, the Admissions Day Monument and a heroic group honoring the Spanish-American War, all statues along <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s Market Street. They learned <PERSON> Tilden </PERSON> was a deaf mute and, according to one newspaper obituary, `` the greatest and most tragic of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> sculptors.'' The Liberatis say the 20 crates contain works found in <PERSON> Tilden </PERSON>'s studio the day he died at the age of 75 Among the casts is a piece <PERSON> Tilden </PERSON> never cast but had planned to call `` The Bridge,'' showing a young man and woman kneeling in an embrace across the waters of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. `` When the bridge is finished,'' <PERSON> Tilden </PERSON> wrote, `` I shall place this on <LOCATION> Telegraph </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> to live with the bridge forever.'' When monumental sculpture went out of style, <PERSON> Tilden </PERSON> never regained the acclaim he knew as a youth. By 1930, he was destitute and died five years later in a studio where the electricity had been cut off.

<HEAD>Soviets Say U.S. Indirectly To Blame For Zia's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Soviet commentator today rejected suggestions that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> or its Afghan allies were responsible for the plane crash that killed <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s president, saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was indirectly to blame. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Glukhov </PERSON> wrote in today's edition of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda that President <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> had created dangerous conditions in his country through the assistance of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` On Pakistani territory are dozens of bases where inveterate terrorist cut-throats train,'' <PERSON> Glukhov </PERSON> wrote. He did not say whether he thinks the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was directly involved in Wednesday's plane crash that killed <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON>. He said an inquiry would have to be completed to determine whether sabotage was involved. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON> and 28 others died when the C-130 transport plane exploded after takeoff following a field inspection of new U.S.-built battle tanks about 30 miles west of the Indian border, near the Pakistani city of <LOCATION> Bahawalpur </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> serves as a base for Moslem guerrillas fighting the Soviet-backed government of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also backs the insurgents, and <PERSON> Glukhov </PERSON> alluded to this in a veiled accusation against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` There are grounds to believe that the <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> played a fatal role in <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s fate. It is the <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> that prevented <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> from getting out of a chronic crisis and achieving stability,'' the commentator wrote. He said without elaborating that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure had drawn <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> into an undeclared war against <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The new Pakistani president, <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, has said the crash was an act of sabotage but declined to speculate on who might be responsible. Several Pakistani newspapers published unsourced reports that officials believed the plane was hit by a missile. Others reported they suspected a bomb in the cockpit. Still others said explosives may have been concealed in a basket of mangos. Pravda quoted the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> as saying in an editorial that if an investigation shows the crash resulted from a bomb explosion, then Afghan communists and their Soviet allies should be suspected. <PERSON> Glukhov </PERSON> said such accusations reflect the `` incompetence'' of people trying to `` throw a shadow'' over Afghan and Soviet efforts to bring peace to the region.

<TEXT>
 An Irish soldier of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> accidentally shot and killed himself while cleaning his rifle, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> statement said today. Pvt. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, 27, was hit in the stomach Sunday, the statement said. He was flown by helicopter to a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> field hospital in the Lebanese border town of <LOCATION> Naqoura </LOCATION> but died a short while later.

<HEAD>Quayle: No Strings Pulled in Law School Admission</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, R-Ind., said today that even though he was a mediocre, `` proverbial C + student'' in college, his influential family did n't pull strings to get him admitted to law `` There's been nothing that has been substantiated that any rules were violated, that we did anything that was unfair,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, responding to questions on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' about how he entered <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in 1970 and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in 1969. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the 41-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee, made his comments the day after The Plain Dealer in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> reported that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had not met the admissions requirements for the law school, but gained entrance after meeting with the admissions dean, a Republican judge in a city where <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s family owned the local newspaper. The Plain Dealer said the meeting came after <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had been rejected by the law school. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> acknowledged today that he was not a stellar student at <ORGANIZATION> DePauw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> from which he graduated in 1969. But he said he always wanted to attend law school. `` My grades in college were not good,'' he said. `` I was your proverbial C + student I wish I had been more serious in college, I have to confess that.'' In the same interview, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> rejected the notion that he tried to avoid the Vietnam War by joining the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. `` The point is that I was willing to serve. I served in the National Guard, had my unit been called to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, like other units in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> were called to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, I would have served and served with distinction, I hope.'' The issue of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s service in the guard was raised Sunday by Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., who had been in the running to serve as <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s No 2 until <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> picked <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who lost the use of an arm as a result of a injury suffered in World War II, said that in his generation `` You knew who was in the guard and who was in uniform fighting for their country.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said that many people in his home state are `` very sensitive about it. They did n't have anybody they could call. They could n't influence anyone.'' On the issue of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s entrance into night law school in the fall of 1970, The Plain Dealer said it confirmed in an interview with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, that the school admitted <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> despite an academic record at <ORGANIZATION> DePauw </ORGANIZATION> that fell below the law school's entrance requirements. `` They were n't going to accept him. He did n't fit their criterion,'' said the elder <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, publisher of the Huntington -LRB- Ind. -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Herald-Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` So <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> went down there and talked to the dean. He talked his way in. <PERSON> Danny </PERSON>, he's a pretty good salesman.'' In 1972, the admissions dean, <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Frandsen </PERSON>, conducted <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s marriage ceremony to <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, also a law student, at her parents' home. <PERSON> Frandsen </PERSON> was a Republican city judge in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, where the <PERSON> Quayle-Pulliam </PERSON> family owns the local newspaper. <PERSON> Frandsen </PERSON> also became <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s campaign manager in <LOCATION> Boone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in his 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race. The school's admissions committee reviewed at least 1,200 applications in 1970 and offered admission to 450 students to fill 275 openings, <PERSON> Frandsen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cleon </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foust </PERSON>, now retired dean of the law school, called entry requirements strict. Undergraduate grades were about twice as important as scores on the national law school admissions test -LRB- LSAT -RRB-, he said. <PERSON> Foust </PERSON> recalls no pressure to admit <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Letters of recommendation written on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s behalf are in school files, which are not made public. The law school required a minimum grade point average of 2.6 -LRB- on a 4.0 scale -RRB- at the time <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> entered, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported. The Plain Dealer and the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> also reported over the weekend that an executive who worked for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s late grandfather, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulliam </PERSON>, owner of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s largest newspapers, arranged an interview for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> with <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sendak </PERSON>, then attorney general of the state. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, then 22, attending night classes at law school and serving in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> on weekends, was thinking about taking a city government job in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. But the senator's father asked <PERSON> Medford </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, editor and political columnist of <PERSON> Pulliam </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, to find the young man `` something better,'' The Plain Dealer reported `` He said he got him a interview with <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Sendack </PERSON>, the attorney general. I said, OK, fine, and I told <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> to go down there,'' recalled <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> became chief investigator in the attorney general's consumer office and later administrative assistant to <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitcomb </PERSON>, then <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor

 <PERSON> Chriss </PERSON> <PERSON> Gittens </PERSON>, who performed for 35 years in the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s long-running radio serial `` The Archers,'' has died at age 86. <PERSON> Gittens </PERSON>, who had a heart attack in 1959, had been in a nursing home since the beginning of the month. The <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> said he died Sunday in his sleep. <PERSON> Gittens </PERSON> played the irascible old countryman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> in a series heard by 7 million listeners every weeknight.

He joined the permanent cast in 1953, on the death of the actor who created the character of <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON>. Over the years, he made the role his own. <PERSON> Gittens </PERSON> will not be replaced, the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>'s head of network radio for the <LOCATION> Midlands </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jock </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>, said Sunday. `` We would n't think for a minute of casting someone else in that part,'' he said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` <PERSON> Chriss </PERSON> was one of the great personalities.

<TEXT>
 One zoo-hatched Andean condor died in transit to a wilderness area but three others survived for an experiment intended to show the best way to reintroduce endangered <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condors into the wild. The surviving birds were safely placed in secret holding pens Saturday in <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Padres </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, and more Andean condors will be taken to the area in October, said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowhan </PERSON>, condor recovery coordinator for the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The dead bird was sent to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> for an autopsy, <PERSON> Dowhan </PERSON> said. He said its death will have little effect on the program. `` In some ways, you kind of want things to go wrong now instead of later,'' he said. The South American birds, all females to prevent breeding in the wild, are being used to test techniques biologists hope to use to begin returning the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condor to the wild after their numbers are increased in a captive breeding program. Only 28 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condors are known to survive, all in captivity at the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Zoo. The Andean condor was chosen for the experiment because it is the closest living relative to the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condor. Though the Andean condors are also endangered, they number in the thousands. Scientists are conducting the experiment to see how birds hatched in captivity adapt to freedom and fend for themselves without native birds of their species to serve as examples. The 3 - and 4-month-old birds will spend several weeks in mesh enclosures in the forest 75 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> When the Andean birds are able to fly, around November, scientist will fit them with radio transmitters, release them and monitor their progress. The Andean birds will remain in the wild until it's time to release <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condors, perhaps as early as 1992 if the captive breeding program continues to succeed, <PERSON> Dowhan </PERSON> said.

 Authorities in the tiny central African nation of <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> said today at least 5,000 people were killed in ethnic clashes that sent 35,000 people fleeing across the border. `` They've been able to get back into the hills and determine the extent of the massacre,'' a senior Western diplomat told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> Bujumbura </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Cyprien </PERSON> <PERSON> Mbonimpa </PERSON>, issued the government's first official estimate of the number killed in last week's massacre in a communique given to foreign diplomats at a morning briefing. `` It indicated the government's latest body count, the number of those killed, now is about 5,000,'' said the diplomat, who spoke on condition he not be further identified. <PERSON> Mbonimpa </PERSON> described as `` highly exaggerated'' a media report that at least 24,000 people had been killed in the fighting that began Aug. 14 between the Hutu, <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>'s majority tribe, and the <PERSON> Tutsi </PERSON>, the minority tribe that controls the military and rules the country, the diplomat said. `` From every report, including those from non-governmental sources, no one believes that figure,'' he said. State-run Radio <LOCATION> Kigali </LOCATION> today said 35,000 people escaped the fighting by fleeing to <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>'s northern neighbor, <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION>. The radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> officials on Sunday met Rwandan officials at <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION>'s southern border town of <LOCATION> Butare </LOCATION>, where the refugees are gathered. It gave no details of the discussions, but said the <LOCATION> Rwandan </LOCATION> officials promised the <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> officials they would not allow anyone to use their territory to stage attacks on <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> has claimed last week's violence was caused by expatriate Hutus who infiltrated northern <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> from foreign countries and incited the resident <PERSON> Hutu </PERSON> population to massacre the Tutsis. Peace was restored to the area within a day after the army moved in, the government has said. The Hutu and the Tutsi are long-time enemies. Following an abortive coup attempt in 1972 in <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>, a former <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> colony, the Tutsi massacred 100,000 to 300,000 Hutu, including most of the tribe's intelligentsia. <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> has said most of last week's victims were Tutsi, but an exiled opposition group, the <ORGANIZATION> Hutu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, accused the Tutsi-dominated military of massacring Hutus. A diplomatic source said there was no evidence of this. Hutu account for more than 90 percent of the population in the northern area around two communes known as <LOCATION> Marangara </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ntega </LOCATION> where most of the killings occurred. <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> is mostly rural and people reside in such communes. <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION> are among the world's most densely populated nations, and <LOCATION> Rwandan </LOCATION> officials said its resources were being strained by the large influx of refugees. Nearly 5 million people live in <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>, which is about the size of the state of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. Eighty-four percent of its people are Hutu, with the remainder <PERSON> Tutsi </PERSON>. The same percentages apply to the 6 million people in <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION>, which is slightly smaller in size than <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>'s official communique `` promised to work with and try to assist the refugees to fled to <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION> to try to return them to their homes as soon as possible,'' according to the Western diplomat. The communique said the government had the situation under control and that the military, the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> and the bureaucracy had been ordered to `` show restraint,'' the diplomat said. `` It said the policy of the government was one of respect for human rights and of ethnic reconciliation,'' he said. There is a 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew throughout <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>, a ban on meetings of more than five people and restriction on travel between towns.

 The secret to championship whistling is just `` pucker up and start blowing,'' says the winner of the 11th-annual International Whistle-Off competition. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thoreson </PERSON>, a 57-year-old Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> brakeman from <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>, overcame stomach flu Sunday to top a field of 30 contestants for his fourth grand championship. He wins a round-trip air fare to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. Whistlers from 15 states and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> competed in what's billed as the nation's premier whistling event. Top female whistlers were <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Ediger </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, who won the solo popular female division and finished second in the classical female division, and <PERSON> L'Vai </PERSON> <PERSON> Kildow </PERSON>, who won the dual division and classical female division. <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officer stationed at <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, brought the audience to its feet with his excerpt from <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s Fifth Symphony, but was awarded second in the solo classical male category. Boos and catcalls from the crowd greeted the judges' decision and division winner <PERSON> Ugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Conti </PERSON> of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cerrito </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, agreed as he handed over his first-place trophy to <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON>. `` I think he's the best,'' said <PERSON> Conti </PERSON>, who won with a Bach-Vivaldi medley. `` I hope that one day we can have a competition where the person who is the people's choice is the winner,'' said <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON>, who paid the air fare for himself and his family to fly to his third Whistle-Off. <PERSON> Thoreson </PERSON> whistled `` Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain'' and `` Sweet Georgia Brown'' to capture first in the solo popular male division. His juggling and magic acts while whistling the circus tune, `` Day at Fair,'' brought a second in the novelty division, and <PERSON> Brahms </PERSON>' `` Hungarian Dance Number Five'' gave him third in the solo classical male division. <PERSON> Thoreson </PERSON> said he began whistling at the age of 6 and `` practiced 40 years before getting on stage'' in 1977. `` People ask me all the time how to whistle and all I say is ` pucker up and start blowing,''' he said. `` I really think whistling is a God-given gift like opera singing.'' Another top whistler, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, captured first in the novelty division with his renditions of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Sousa </PERSON>'s rousing `` El Capitan'' and `` Stars and Stripes'' marches. <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>, the event's grand champion in 1986, dressed as a band conductor with hat and plume and held a piccolo to his lips as he whistled the songs. He also had the crowd clapping in his second-place finish behind <PERSON> Thoreson </PERSON> in the solo popular male division with a fast <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON> <PERSON> Yankovich </PERSON> tune, `` Litchensteiner Polka.'' `` When I get to the ya-ya-yaing, I want you to do it fast with me,'' he told the crowd, which eagerly ya-ya-yaed.

 Health department officials are trying to determine if any regulations were violated when an elderly nursing home patient who was still alive was mistaken for a dead woman and taken to a funeral home for embalming.

Health officials said the incident began Aug. 10 when the woman's 91-year-old roommate died at the Bridge View Nursing Home in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>. Someone at the nursing home apparently drew a curtain around the woman who was still alive, and attendants from the funeral home assumed she was the dead woman and took her to the funeral home in a body bag, authorities said. The woman was taken to a hospital and later returned to the nursing home. Health officials said they also are trying to determine who was responsible for the mix-up.

 Baton-swinging police fired tear gas and charged demonstrators after 10,000 people took to the streets on the 20th anniversary of the Soviet-led invasion that crushed the `` Prague Spring.'' The size of Sunday's spontaneous protest, the biggest against the invasion since 1969, took foreigners and residents by surprise. Witnesses saw at least eight people detained around the city, including Jan Urban, spokesman for the human rights group Charter 77. Twenty-eight people were in custody today and authorities expelled six of seven foreigners detained during the demonstration, the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> said. It gave no other details on the foreigners. The 28 protesters were held `` pending investigation for suspected hooliganism,'' the agency said. It also reported that two police officers were slightly injured by bottles thrown from the crowd Sunday. The marchers chanted demands for freedom, the withdrawal of Soviet troops and support for <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, the ex-Communist Party leader who pioneered the reforms of 1968. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, troops charged hundreds of demonstrators and pushed them out of a central park Sunday when the protesters began chanting `` <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>!'' in memory of the invasion. No injuries were reported among about 500 demonstrators and onlookers, or among the 500 national guard soldiers and police. Several dozen people, some shouting `` Fascists!'' at police, were taken away. Two activists reported separately that 30 of the protesters were punched and kicked at a nearby militia station after the demonstration. More than 100 of the protesters were detained, said activist <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Podrabinek </PERSON>. Four people were sentenced to 15 days in jail and 40 others were fined, he said. Most of those detained were released after interrogation, the CTK agency said. About 100 demonstrators held a second rally later Sunday along <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Arbat shopping mall, but police chased them away and arrested an unspecified number, said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Chuyev </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, an unofficial group that wants Soviet troops out of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The protests marked Aug. 20-21, 1968, when Soviet-led troops led an invasion of this nation of 15.5 million people. In the spring of 1968, the Czech reformists under <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> declared their intent to create a democratic socialist system that would guarantee free speech and assembly, introduce secret ballot elections and economic reforms. Sunday's police response suggested Czech authorities will not tolerate renewed protests against the invasion, which Soviet leaders continue to insist was `` justified.'' The anniversary march through <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> began after several hundred people milled around in <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, the site in 1968 and 1969 of bloody protests against the invasion. Peace activists collected hundreds of signatures Sunday on a petition demanding a Soviet troop withdrawal, free elections, abolition of censorship and the release of political prisoners. Police kept careful watch on the crowd and, in the early evening, protesters began to chant `` Freedom, Freedom!'' and about 10,000 marched toward the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, a traditional rallying point. About 8,000 began heading toward the <LOCATION> Vltava </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, apparently hoping to cross to <LOCATION> Hradcany </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION>, the official residence of President <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>, who became party leader in 1969 and was himself replaced in December by <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, 67, was expelled from the party in 1970 and given a minor forestry job in <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>. Now retired, he said last week that he planned to spend the invasion anniversary quietly at his country cottage. After police blocked three bridges across the river, the march dwindled to about 1,000 people. When the smaller crowd tried to march back to the square, helmeted police moved in with batons, tear gas, and dogs. They beat at least two people and dragged others away. The state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> issued a brief report on the protests, saying `` disturbing actions'' were mounted and that `` the considerate and decisive action of the police prevented riots.'' Earlier Sunday on <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, 200 people walked behind two representatives of the Charter 77 movement, <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanturkoa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hradilek </PERSON>, who tried to lay flowers by the statue of King Wenceslas. Uniformed police pushed back the two activists and others who tried to lay flowers in memory of countrymen killed in street violence after the invasion. Three Charter 77 spokesmen were detained Saturday as they walked to the Soviet embassy to deliver a statement appealing to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> to tell the truth about the 1968 invasion. They were later reported released, but were not seen at Sunday's demonstrations. Witnesses also said one person was detained when eight people tried to lay flowers at Czechoslovak state radio, also the scene of fierce fighting in 1968.

<HEAD>Records Said To Cast Doubt That He Reached North Pole</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A British Arctic expert says that <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>, credited with being the first explorer to reach the North Pole, may actually have missed the top of the world by 30 to 60 miles, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. Essential data is missing from <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s records and <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s own behavior after returning from a dash to the pole indicates he may have known he missed his objective, according to <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON>, a polar explorer whose conjecture in the September issue of National Geographic magazine was summarized by the Times. <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s diary and other documents of his 1909 expedition, held in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, were opened to scholars recently. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> said his doubts were based on possible navigational errors, extraordinary distance claims and blank pages or insufficient data in <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s diary. The diary entry for April 6, 1909, the day <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> is supposed to have reached the pole, made no mention of it, but a loose page was inserted that proclaimed, `` The pole at last!!!'' <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> said. He said that after returning to camp, <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> showed no desire to celebrate and turned away with both hands covering his eyes when his associate, <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>, went to shake his hand. <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s account contained no detailed record of wind speed, weather and ice conditions or systematic position checks from sun and planet observations, <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> said. In addition to <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s failing to correct for ice drift and other possible errors, `` his chronometer _ critical in navigation _ was 10 minutes fast, an error he was not aware of while on the ice,'' <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> said. `` This alone could have put him west of the pole by 18 miles,'' he said. He said no explorers since, even with snowmobiles, have matched <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s claimed speed over polar pack. <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> said he made the round trip from base camp to pole, 296 miles, in eight days, with 198 miles covered in four days. Other specialists in polar history expressed little surprise at <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON>'s assertions. The experts also seemed resigned to the inconclusiveness of the issue. `` I'm not sure we are ever going to know if he actually made it to the Pole,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Silver Decision Another Slip In Hunts' Fortunes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal jury's order that the Hunt brothers pay more than $ 130 million to a Peruvian company for their scheme to corner the world silver market marks another setback in the fortunes of the flamoyant <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> family. However, Saturday's jury decision in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> will have little effect on the Hunts' efforts to settle a $ 1.5 billion dispute with their lenders, a Hunt bankruptcy attorney said. Besides the legal judgment, the collapse of silver, sugar and real estate investments have all contributed to the steady decline of the family fortune, once estimated at $ 20 billion. The jury said the three <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> brothers conspired to artificially raise the price of silver in the late 1970s to the detriment of <ORGANIZATION> Minpeco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, the mining marketing company of the Peruvian government. <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, 62, and <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, 59, also were found to have engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity to monopolize the silver market. The case is a civil action, so no criminal penalties are attached to the finding. <PERSON> Minpeco </PERSON> had said <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, 56, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION>, and his two brothers conspired unsuccessfully with several <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> businessmen to corner the silver market. But an attorney in the two-year dispute with lenders said the damages awarded in the silver battle were relatively small. `` I feel like the Hunts won,'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, the bankruptcy attorney representing <ORGANIZATION> Placid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which is owned by the trust estate of the Hunt brothers, told the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. The $ 130 million damages could be reduced by the $ 33.4 million amount Minpeco earned on silver it held during the period, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. And $ 64.7 million, which Minpeco received from other defendants in a pretrial settlement, could also be deducted from the amount the Hunts must pay, he said. The Hunts will file motions that raise other issues in the silver case, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Hunt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> vice president. `` The brothers are confident that this wrong result will eventually be overturned as they proceed through the court system,'' <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> said Saturday. At first, the Hunts, sons of the late <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilman H.L. Hunt, took their losses with aplomb. In March 1980, when the silver market crashed, <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said, `` A billion dollars just ai n't what it used to be. In 1986, the brothers were all on the Fortune 400 list of the richest Americans with combined estimated assets of $ 1 billion. Last year, they dropped off the list. This year, when forced to sell his seven <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> farms and 600-horse stable of thoroughbred race horses, the eldest <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> did n't attend the auction. `` It would be too sad to watch,'' he said. The Hunts sued their banks and lenders in July 1986, after they could not renegotiate loans for their <ORGANIZATION> Placid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Penrod </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drilling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The two companies had failed to make payments on a total of $ 1.5 billion in loans. To settle the dispute, the Hunts proposed this spring to pay $ 663.5 million from funds raised through Placid operations, primarily in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. Hearings on the bankruptcy settlement proposal were scheduled to begin this month.

 <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> has n't existed for a half-century, except in the hearts of its former residents. But for five hours Sunday, there was a homecoming for the survivors and children of the 500 people who once lived in the town, first settled in 1763 but erased 50 years ago so <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> could have drinking water. Four little central <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> towns died on April 27, 1938, on order of the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to form the 38-square-mile Quabbin Reservoir, after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected their appeals. Three _ <LOCATION> Enfield </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> _ now lie under 413 billion gallons of water.

Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> declared 1988 a Year of Remembrance for the 2,500 people who lost their homes to the reservoir. Many of those who moved away have returned this spring and summer to attend events sponsored by local historical societies. `` I was just 10 years old when we had to go.

 Rescuers searched through debris today for victims of an earthquake that ravaged one-third of this country's territory and parts of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, killing at least 650 people and injuring thousands. The death toll was expected to climb from Sunday's pre-dawn quake on the India-Nepal border, which triggered landslides and floods and was the mountainous region's deadliest in 38 years. Officials in both countries said they had yet to receive reports from the remote Himalayan areas hardest hit by the temblor, which knocked out power and communications and was said to injure at least 3,000 people. <PERSON> Niranjan </PERSON> <PERSON> Thapa </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>'s minister of state for home affairs, told a news conference at least 450 were dead and up to 1,000 injured. He said officials expected the numbers to climb. Indian officials reported at least 200 people dead and more than 2,000 injured, most by debris from collapsing buildings. The quake, centered almost on the India-Nepal border, registered 6.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. Indian television today showed the devastation in the Indian state of <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION>: crumbled buildings, makeshift morgues lined with rows of bodies wrapped in white shrouds, damaged hospital wards packed with survivors. Medical teams in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> carried medicine and other supplies to overcrowded hospitals and the army was deployed to help search for victims. But the monsoons, which hit the subcontinent in late June and usually last through September, hampered relief operations. <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Thapa </PERSON> told a news conference that `` the rains have been a great hindrance in carrying out rescue works. Access to some areas of this mountain country is impossible.'' He said 21 of the kingdom's 75 districts suffered extensive damage. The hardest hit appeared to be <LOCATION> Dharan </LOCATION>, a sparsely populated border region where <PERSON> Thapa </PERSON> said at least 131 people died. <PERSON> Bir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahadur </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahi </PERSON>, secretary of the home affairs ministry, flew to eastern <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> on Sunday. He said 50,000 to 60,000 houses were destroyed in the <LOCATION> Dharan </LOCATION> district alone. `` Ninety percent of the remaining houses are cracked,'' <PERSON> Shahi </PERSON> said, adding that most of the damage was to modern houses of stone and older houses from mud and bricks. Wooden houses were not affected, he said. Many people were given shelter in schools, guesthouses and public buildings, `` but most of the people do not want to leave their homes,'' <PERSON> Shahi </PERSON> said. He said water supplies were still adequate and there were no reports of disease breaking out. Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> to tour some of the hardest hit areas. The government said it would release a detailed report after he returned to the capital tonight. Prime Minister <PERSON> Marich </PERSON> <PERSON> Man </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrestha </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> visited some of the victims at <LOCATION> Bir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in his capital, <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION>. The quake roused people from their sleep in <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> and nine other Indian states and central and eastern <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>. It lasted about a minute and aftershocks continued for about an hour. Rail tracks sank into the soggy ground and bridges over rising rivers cracked, paralyzing train service and road travel in many parts of the devastated areas. Parts of northern <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and the capital, <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, also felt the tremor. There were reports that 50 people were injured, most by jumping from their houses during the quake. Witnesses in <LOCATION> Darbhanga </LOCATION>, an Indian city of 800,000 about 45 miles south of the epicenter, said the only warnings were hissing sounds, rattling doors and cracking windows. Women began blowing conch shells, following an ancient tradition believed to appease the weather gods. More than 25,000 houses were flattened in <LOCATION> Darbhanga </LOCATION>, as well as the districts of <PERSON> Munger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Madhubani </PERSON>, Indian officials said. In <LOCATION> Madhubani </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Bhootahi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Balan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> jumped its banks and flooded nearly 50 villages. Officials said at least 45 people died, but it was not known whether the deaths were due to floods or collapsing houses. It was the worst quake to strike the region in 38 years. A temblor rumbled through the Indian state of <LOCATION> Assam </LOCATION> on the India-China border in August 1950. Official accounts said more than 1,500 people died, but seismologists said their records showed 30,000 were killed. The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every increase of one number means the ground motion is 10 times greater. A quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in populated areas.

 A book describing <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> as a fearful, even paranoid president was criticized today by a former <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> press secretary as the work of someone who barely knew the former president. Former Secretary of State Dean <PERSON> Rusk </PERSON>, meanwhile, disputed one incident described in the book. In a soon-to-be-published book entitled, `` Remembering America: A Voice from the Sixties,'' former <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> speechwriter <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> describes <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> as intensely fearful of his political rivals and prone to lapse into irrational ramblings about them. `` I am very very uneasy about diagnoses of paranoia, even when they're made by an expert and <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON>'s not an expert,'' said former press secretary <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Reedy </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> really only knew him for a year or so and did n't really know him too well for that year.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> frequently `` would blow off steam,'' <PERSON> Reedy </PERSON> said, and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides understood that they should ignore some of the wild directives he would issue during these episodes, <PERSON> Reedy </PERSON> said. In addition, he said, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was highly manipulative and may have intended to shock <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON>, whom he knew to be a friend of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. `` I do n't think he has enough background to put it in the right perspective,'' <PERSON> Reedy </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rusk </PERSON>, in a telephone interview today, said, `` I pay no attention whatever to talk like that from <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON>. I consider it irresponsible and untrue.'' The book quotes <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> referring to blacks as `` niggers;'' calling top foreign service officials as `` those damn <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> ambassadors trying to get me and discredit me;'' and accusing liberals and top newspaper columnists of being communists. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> is also portrayed as obsessed with <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, whom he accused of plotting against him. An advance chapter of the book provided to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> focused on <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s behavior in 1965, a year when he was at the height of his political power. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was planning the first full-scale commitment of American troops to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> while in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> he was pushing landmark legislation on poverty and civil rights. In April 1965, <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> wrote, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> canceled a scheduled visit by the leaders of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> after the two expressed opposition to the Vietnam War. <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> described a heated conversation between <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rusk </PERSON> after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassadors to those countries suggested <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> send Vice President <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> to ease any hurt feelings. `` <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> read them, then, his face contorted in fury, rose and slammed them onto his desk. ` I do n't want telegrams like that,' he almost shouted, then picked up the phone. ` Get me <PERSON> Rusk </PERSON>. ... Listen Mr. Secretary,' he began, softly sardonic, ` You know those telegrams about <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>?' ... The president suddenly raised his voice: ` If they send me any more telegrams like that, I want you to call them back. Fire the bunch of them.''' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> hung up and said to his aides, `` It's those damn <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> ambassadors trying to get me and discredit me.'' <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> said he was told by a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> correspondent that <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> had referred to the snubbed leaders as, `` those two niggers.'' <PERSON> Rusk </PERSON> said today, `` No such phone call took place and I do n't remember the cancellation of those two visits. <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON>, although not a trained psychologist, argued that <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> exhibited paranoid behavior. The conclusion is based on <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON>'s observations as well as discussions about <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> the author had at the time with a psychiatrist. `` <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> had become a very dangerous man,'' wrote <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON>, a resident of <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` There is no question in my mind that both the atmosphere of the White House and the decisions taken until 1965 -LRB- the only period I personally observed -RRB- were affected by the periodic disruptions of <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s mind and spirit.'' <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> was an aide to President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and later was the senior speech writer for <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> left the <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> administration in 1965 and later became an opponent of the Vietnam War.

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> today refused to rule out detention without trial for guerrilla suspects, saying she wanted to keep the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guessing following the killing of eight British soldiers. `` You do not tell your enemies precisely what it is you are going to do, ever,'' she said. `` We are having a thorough -LRB- security -RRB- review of all matters and nothing has been ruled out.'' Her comments appeared to contradict <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION>, which quoted unidentified government sources saying she had rejected calls by <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> leaders in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> for the internment of 60 to 80 known <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas. Internment without trial was introduced in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> on Aug. 9, 1971 by the government of Conservative Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>. Following worldwide criticism, it was abandoned by the government of Labor Prime Minister <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> in December 1975. Speaking to reporters after opening a hospital in the southwest <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> branded the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bus bombing an assassination. She vowed, `` We must never let the terrorists win.'' Official Unionist lawmaker <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Maginnes </PERSON>, one of the lawmakers who wants internment brought back, confirmed today that he gave Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> the names of three <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> men he claimed were involved in Friday night's bombing. The attack killed eight and wounded 27 young members of the First Battalion of the Light Infantry who were just coming off furlough in mainland <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility immediately afterward. It was the deadliest <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> attack since 1982 and brought the number of military deaths in a summer blitz to 26. Northern Ireland Secretary <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, the Cabinet member responsible for the province, visited some of the injured and promised a relentless campaign against `` the men of evil.'' He said the government and the army would take whatever steps were necessary to defend `` what is good and what is right in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.'' However, the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said King is convinced reintroduction of internment would be counter-productive. King met with security chiefs in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> today. The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. It wants to unite the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> province with the overwhelmingly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> said in a <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> radio interview Sunday that his government quickly realized after the introduction of internment in 1971 that the policy had been a major mistake. He said: `` The people who were interned really bore very little resemblance to those who were out to cause damage. The way in which they were arrested ... caused reaction ... throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the rest of the world, which was very damaging to us. `` Thirdly, it gave the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> a means of recruiting from amongst people who were interned,'' he said. Critics of internment said many of the hundreds of people rounded up were innocent. They also said many of the internees were brutally treated and that the policy discriminated against Roman Catholics. In 1978, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> ruled that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> had been guilty of inhuman and degrading treatment, in a case brought by 12 former internees subjected to in-depth interrogation.

<TEXT>
 More than four years after a widow with no children died and left about $ 135,000 to the federal government to reduce the national debt, the money is still in the bank drawing interest. Lawyers for three parties _ the deceased, <PERSON> Minnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, the federal government and the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> _ only recently worked out an agreement to dispose of the estate. The agreement capped a lengthy dispute over whether the state is entitled to claim inheritance tax from Ms. <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>'s estate. Under the agreement, the state may claim its share _ about $ 30,000 _ and the federal government gets the rest. The agreement was recently approved by <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Karem </PERSON>. Now the parties are awaiting final approval from <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Probate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spalding </PERSON>, who is handling the case for the federal government. When Ms. <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, died in May 1984 at age 85, she left about $ 35,000 and some property to seven nieces and nephews. The rest, about $ 135,000, `` I bequeath and devise to my beloved country, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, to be used to reduce the national debt,'' the will stated. Efforts to settle the estate hit a snag soon after her death when the state tried to claim inheritance taxes from the money that was to go to the federal government. The federal government agreed to pay the inheritance tax, but <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>'s lawyer sued, saying he did not think it was Ms. <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>'s intent that part of her money should go to the state. Although the federal government will still receive more than $ 100,000 if the compromise is approved, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Liebschutz </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Debt </ORGANIZATION>, noted that it wo n't make a noticeable dent in the public debt, now at $ 2.5 trillion

 A street-preaching 11-year-old was suspended minutes after arriving for the first day of school today after he stuck a Bible in the principal's face and told him `` you go to hell,'' school officials said. `` I have trouble when a child says -LRB- that -RRB- to an authority figure,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorst </PERSON>, principal of <ORGANIZATION> Eastfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> <PERSON> Strode </PERSON>, 11, had taken only about 10 steps on school property before he confronted <PERSON> Gorst </PERSON>, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Strode </PERSON>, the boy's father, who quoted his son as telling the principal, `` you'll go to hell. School officials, however, captured the confrontation on videotape which confirms <PERSON> Gorst </PERSON>'s version, said <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastfield </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant principal. Strode said he took all three of his preaching children home after <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON>'s suspension, and did not know whether he would take them to school Tuesday. Last year, <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> was repeatedly suspended for shouting Bible verses and preaching against `` whoremongers'' and `` fornicators.'' The father said today's trouble began when a sheriff's deputy took the hand of Pepper, 7, who started screaming, and <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> `` became enraged.'' Strode and his wife, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON>, have been banned from school property and watched from beyond the gates. Family friends had planned to escort the children from the gate to the school building, but officials instead ordered the deputies to take the children. That's when Pepper began screaming, <PERSON> Strode </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gorst </PERSON> then asked Strode to bring his children into the school. Strode said he refused and walked away with the three children. At that point, <PERSON> Gorst </PERSON> asked him to bring the younger children back, saying only <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> was suspended, Strode said. `` They just do n't want <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> at school, period,'' Strode said. <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> was suspended for 10 days for disruptive and disrespectful behavior, Ms. <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> said. And she warned that a long-term suspension that could last the entire school year `` can be enacted at any point.'' `` School officials have simply said at this point that they will not have this continue for the year,'' she said. <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON>, 6, were preaching on their way to the school grounds, <PERSON> Strode </PERSON> said. Pepper, who did not preach last year, yelled `` repent'' a couple of times, he said. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> McDowell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION> Superintendent <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricketts </PERSON> said he and other school officials dreaded the first day of school because last year, the Strode children had preached about `` whoremongers and `` fornicators.'' `` We can not go through another year like we did last year,'' he said. <PERSON> Ricketts </PERSON> on Friday notified Mrs. Strode and her husband, <PERSON> David </PERSON>, in a registered letter that they were barred from the school grounds; he warned them that `` appropriate action'' would be taken if they came onto school property. The trouble began last spring when <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON>, a fifth-grade A student, came to school one morning in March and stood near the back entrance shouting Bible verses. When teachers and students passed, <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> shouted verses about whoremongers and fornicators. When the principal asked <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> to come inside the school, he refused. Soon after, kindergartener <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> did the same thing. First-grader Pepper accompanied <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> but did not preach. Mrs. <PERSON> Strode </PERSON> said Pepper would join her brothers in quoting scriptures this year. <PERSON> Ricketts </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> say they're concerned about the Strode children's effect on other children at the school, especially kindergarten students, who on their first day of school will be confronted by yelling children and parents. They're urging parents to stay calm. `` We're hoping the citizens of the county will be understanding and realize we are doing everything we can as fast as we can,'' <PERSON> Ricketts </PERSON> said.

 Gale-force wind eased as more than 1,000 soldiers flew today to <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> to relieve some of the weary firefighters who have spent weeks battling blazes that have charred more than 350,000 acres. The first wave of the 1,200 soldiers from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, was expected to arrive today to help contain a fire burning out of the northeastern corner of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> that is threatening two communities in southern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. The first 600 infantrymen from 4th Battalion, 23rd Infantry of the 111th Field Artillery were expected to be on fire lines by Tuesday or Wednesday. Elsewhere, crews mopped up after three fires that totaled about 13,000 acres and had threatened the tribal capital of Lame Deer on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation in southeastern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. But just south of the reservation, the <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> fire had grown to 10,000 to 12,000 acres and was out of control, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lands </ORGANIZATION> said today. And in northern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, hot, dry wind Sunday plagued 200 firefighters in the <LOCATION> Nez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Perce </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION>, where a 320-acre fire burned in inaccessible terrain 11 miles north of the <LOCATION> Salmon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. In southern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, the soldiers will try to stop the 156,000-acre Clover-Mist fire that has burned out of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> to within two miles of <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and Silvergate. `` They've continued to be able to save structures. Also they're hoping they can stop the fire from reaching the area,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON> No evacuations have been ordered, but some residents have left on their own, she said. `` We're realists,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` We've watched the fire go past containment line after containment line, and we're scared. `` Winds were calmer and the fires did not progress as dramatically as they did yesterday,'' <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON> said late Sunday. At times Saturday, the fires created a spectacular sight. `` There were walls of flame that can be anywhere from 100-300 feet high. No humans and no equipment can stop fires when they're in that stage,'' <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON> said Fires that had covered around 280,000 acres of the park Saturday had spread over at least 350,000 acres by Sunday, or about 16 percent of the park's 2.2 million acres, <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s south entrance remained closed indefinitely today, as was the <LOCATION> Grant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> area, which contains a hotel, a campground, a visitor center and housing for staff. <LOCATION> Grant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> was closed Saturday because of a flareup of the Red-Shoshone fire. Large sections of highway in the park also were closed, as were several campgrounds. South of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>, the Rockefeller Memorial Parkway connecting the park with Grand Teton National Park was closed because of two fires in the <ORGANIZATION> Bridger-Teton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. Officials evacuated the <ORGANIZATION> Teton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, several ranches and two campgrounds. In <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, fire crews battling a 37,200-acre forest fire southeast of <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> dug fire lines by hand today on the southern edge of the fire, officials said. Fire information officer <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Krepps </PERSON> said the crews were going into rugged terrain in the <LOCATION> Elkhorn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, in an attempt to contain the southern edge of the blaze that has burned 10 houses and cabins. In north-central <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, more than 1,000 firefighters, aided by heavy rain, contained a 4,500-acre fire on the Rocky Boy's Indian Reservation on Sunday. In southeastern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Rosebud </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, two large lightning-caused timber fires are being fought southeast of <LOCATION> Forsyth </LOCATION>. The 7,000-acre <PERSON> Espy </PERSON> fire remained out of control Sunday night, primarily burning grass and sagebrush southeast of <LOCATION> Forsyth </LOCATION> and east of <LOCATION> Colstrip </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Tonn </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in Billings.

<HEAD>Soviets Cutting Back on Awarding Medals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is cutting back on awarding medals, criticizing the number of honors handed out during the <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> era and adopting rules to ensure they are given to workers who deserve them. Under the late leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, awards were given out `` by the scores and even by hundreds'' to people who had fulfilled the government's five-year production plans, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. People have stopped appreciating awards because `` they were given out with a bountiful hand in the <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> period on the occasion of birthdays and red-letter dates,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The real contribution of the person awarded was not duly taken into account,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the nominal parliament, has adopted new rules on medals to make sure they are given to people who truly deserve them, the news agency said. The image of <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> himself is one of a man with a full chest of medals, and the Soviet press has recently lampooned him for this. The overhaul of the award system is another element of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s drive to hold public officials more accountable for their work and to end blind praise for them. It also is another step in moving away from the policies of <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, now condemned widely for plaguing the country with cronyism, corruption and economic stagnation. To improve the system, decisions on recipients wo n't be made by a small number of high-ranking officials in private, but by all work collectives and public organizations, the news agency said. Awards will no longer be made en masse or for reaching a jubilee in a citizen's career. The country's highest honors, including the title Hero of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hero </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, wo n't be given more than once to the same person, as has happened in the past. Eligibility requirements have been tightened for the top decorations, the Order of <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> and Order of the October Revolution, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said without elaborating. But while many of the changes appear aimed cutting the number of awards given, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said new honorary titles were being created for teachers, physicians and agricultural workers. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s administration has placed particular emphasis on improving these professions The article gave no figures for the number of awards given in the past or what the number will be under the new rules.

<HEAD>Government Backs Off On Mandatory Eviction Proposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government on Monday withdrew a widely criticized bill that would force the evictions of tens of thousands of blacks living in areas designated for whites. Critics said the bill, which would require magistrates to evict anyone living in a neighborhood reserved by law for another race, would provoke international outrage. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON>, minister of constitutional development and planning, said the measure would be re-introduced in parliament with amendments specifying that evictions not be mandatory. The amended bill, however, would retain other provisions strengthening enforcement of residential segregation. Leaders of the parliament's Asian and mixed-race chambers, which can not block most government-backed bills, said their houses would adjourn indefinitely to protest the new legislation. <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON> said the amended bill would allow government officials to consider the availability of alternative housing and other `` humanitarian considerations'' before approving evictions. In other ways, he said, it would remain identical to the original measure. Among the controversial measures remaining in the bill are those making it easier for authorities to confiscate property and to evict and prosecute people violating the Group Areas Act. The 35-year-old act designates racially segregated neighborhoods. Under both the new and old versions of the bill, the maximum fine for property owners who allow a person to live outside his racial area would increase from about $ 165 to $ 4,100. The maximum prison sentence would increase from two years to five years. The act is a major issue in the campaign for nationwide municipal elections Oct. 26. The government's proposal to strengthen enforcement of the act has been seen as an accommodation to right-wing whites. The government has not strictly enforced the Group Areas Act in recent years, angering conservative whites opposed to integrated neighborhoods. President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said last week he believes residential segregation is favored by 80 percent of whites, 70 percent of Asians and people of mixed race, and a majority of blacks. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON>, leader of the mixed-race chamber of parliament, challenged <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s claim, saying his constituents favored total repeal of the act. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s black majority is excluded from parliament, but both the mixed-race and <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> chambers are expected to reject the Group Areas legislation and its amendments. This would force the government to refer the bill to the President's Council, a body controlled by <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The party has the power to implement legislation over the opposition of the two non-white chambers. Parliament, which reconvened Monday after a midyear recess, also is to debate legislation on creating the first `` open areas,'' or legal multiracial neighborhoods. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> would have veto power over any such plans.

 Six Cuban-Americans are accused of violating the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Neutrality Act by mounting a private Contra supply operation out of a clandestine southwest <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> camp, according to an indictment unsealed today.

 An <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> woman who eluded armed guards as she swam to freedom through a polluted river says she's three months pregnant, officials reported Monday. Four East Germans swam across <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s Spree River on Sunday evening while an East German patrol boat stopped nearby as they scrambled onto the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> bank near a government building.

Ms. <PERSON> Adryan </PERSON>, 22, broke a foot during the escape, he said. The river, filled with industrial wastes, is about 260 feet wide and under constant East German patrol at the point where the four swam across it. In another incident, police said a young man on a motorcycle tried to speed through the Checkpoint <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> border crossing into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on Monday, but he rammed a barricade East German guards had lowered quickly.

<TEXT>
 People filled the streets of <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> cities Monday demanding an end to 26 years of military rule, and soldiers peacefully stopped protest marches in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, the capital, diplomats and news reports said. The Japanese news agency <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> said hundreds of thousands of people, including children, demonstrated in the northern city of <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION> in response to student calls for nationwide protest and a general strike. Some waved the peacock flag used in the struggle that led to independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1948. Many train and bus operators joined the strike, halting public transport in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s second-largest city 350 miles north of the capital, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> said. There were sketchy reports of demonstrations in other parts of the Southeast Asian country. Diplomats in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> said about 20,000 people gathered outside the <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, a center of protest, for the largest demonstration in the capital since the street protests of Aug. 8-12 rioting that forced the resignation of President <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, a former general. Security forces killed more than 100 people that week. No violence was reported Monday. Witnesses said large numbes of soldiers, the most seen in recent days, manned barricades and armored cars patrolled the capital. Reports of gunshots could not be confirmed. A Western diplomat said 3,000-4 ,000 people shouted anti-government slogans outside the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, but soldiers and barricades stopped them from marching down the street Protesters demand that new President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, who on Friday became the country's first civilian leader in 26 years, end the stern one-party rule of the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the economic hardship it has created. <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> authorities `` want to avoid violence, but at the same time they're determined that things do n't get out of control,'' a Western diplomat said. He added that students have called for daily demonstrations. Diplomats said most people went to work despite the strike and most shops in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> were open. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> said demonstrators students, <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks, public servants and professionals were among demonstrators at the hospital. It said they held banners and shouted slogans, including `` Down with one-party dictatorship!'' and `` Now more than ever democracy!'' Some attempted a one-mile march to the <LOCATION> Sule </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pagoda </LOCATION>, where huge rallies were held Aug. 8-12, but up to 15 truckloads of soldiers were parked in front of it. `` When about half of those taking part in the rally set out to march, they were blocked by soldiers,'' an Asian diplomat said. `` We've heard that the soldiers sent marchers running away but there have been no reports of any injuries or deaths. From what I observed, those taking part in the rally were generally ... peaceful and the soldiers also seemed to be holding back.'' At <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, at the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border in the south, about 10,000 people marched to the town hall Monday shouting anti-government slogans, a Thai police official said. <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, 490 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, is a market ton on the frontier between <LOCATION> Megui </LOCATION> province and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ranong </LOCATION> province. Security forces there turned against the government during the protests of Aug. 8-12 and gave protesters free rein, <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> officials said. A man claiming to speak for a coalition of 16 university student unions called news agencies in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> and said the alliance was seeking help from Burmese rebel groups in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. He claimed it has about 50,000 members. Rebels hold large areas of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> bordering <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Brang </LOCATION> Seng, a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> of 10 guerrilla armies, declared last week it would join the protesting students. The <ORGANIZATION> Karen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, one of the strongest rebel groups, issued a statement Monday in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> declaring support for the students and calling on foreign governments to halt aid to burma until one-party rule ends. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, the Western-educated attorney general, became <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s first civilian leader since Ne Win seized power in a 1962 military coup. Ne Win resigned in July and ally <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON> replaced him. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> has been in turmoil since September 1987, when the government voided 60 percent of the currency in circulation without compensation. University students rioted to protest the resulting hardship in a nation whose per capita annual income of less $ 200 is among the world's lowest. More riots, increasingly focused on political demands, occurred in March and June. Protesters accuse <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> of personally ordering ruthless suppression of the demonstrations. Rioting resumed after <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> became president and party chief July 27, and soldiers fired into crowds. The government has said 112 people were killed and 267 wounded in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> alone, but diplomats said they believed the toll was higher.

<TEXT>
 It's been 14 years since the kitchen closed at the Olivero Cafe, but <PERSON> Minnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivero </PERSON> still entertains friends there and tidies up the counter she toiled behind for more than 40 years. Although you ca n't buy a meal at the diner, or pay 10 cents for a slice of homemade pie, the <PERSON> Olivero </PERSON> <PERSON> Cafe </PERSON> remains open to old friends and to strangers curious about times past. `` This place is a museum and I am too,'' laughed Mrs. <PERSON> Olivero </PERSON>, who will be 82 on Tuesday. `` I guess I'm an antique, like most of the things in here.'' The tiny cafe is a classic 1930s-era diner and soda fountain that seated about 25 people at its five tables and stools. For 40 years, five months and three days, <PERSON> Minnie </PERSON> served sandwiches, coffee, her special chili, homemade pie and ice cream to hungry truk drivers, coal miners, motorists, farmers and residents of this town of 800 located about 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>. The cafe was open seven days a week, often 12 hours a day, and every holiday through the Great Depression, World War II and the post-war boom. `` <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> always used to say we'd close when the last nickel goes by the window,'' she said. `` It was a part of our lives and we both enjoyed it. It's not because we were more dedicated than anyone else or a different cut of people.'' <PERSON> Minnie </PERSON> dropped out of school in sixth grade to work in her parents general store in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, in 1919. She married <PERSON> Louis </PERSON>, a coal miner, in 1924. The couple was flat broke three times early in their marriage, Mrs. <PERSON> Olivero </PERSON> said. In 1933, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> borrowed $ 100 from his wife's family to buy a cafe on old Route 29 in <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> `` When <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> told me he bought the cafe, I told him to go run it by himself because I did n't like to cook,'' she said. But cook she did, earning a reputation for her homemade chocolate syrup and soda fountain syrups. She also cleaned, collected telephone bill payments, sold tobacco, candy, greeting cards, bus tickets and blew the community fire whistle every evening. `` The old hard road was the main drag between <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` We had a lot of coal-truck drivers and they hauled straw from all around here up to <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oats </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>. We had a good business.'' In 1937, the <PERSON> Oliveros </PERSON> moved their cafe to a new building on the corner where Main Street intersected the highway. They lived behind the cafe and <PERSON> Minnie </PERSON> cooked in the family kitchen. Their only child, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>, ran the candy counter and helped out at the cafe until he left to fight in World War II as a pilot. In 1945, he was killed over the <LOCATION> Adriatic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and his body was never found. `` After that, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> quit working at the coal mine and we both worked at the cafe,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Olivero </PERSON> said. `` The only reason we worked that hard was to build a nest egg for our son.'' For the first time, they closed the cafe to take vacation trips each summer. The rest of the year, however, they remained open every day, Christmas included. `` I enjoyed it and <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> did too,'' she said. `` I think now how crazy we must have been. But it was our life.'' It still is <PERSON> Minnie </PERSON>'s life. Her husband died shortly after they closed in 1974 and she has kept the cafe as a private museum ever since. Shiny milk-shake glasses and various size <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> glasses stand on the wall behind the soda fountain. <PERSON> Minnie </PERSON> still uses the antique cash register to hold her spare change, and the ice box and refrigerator hold her groceries. There are plates on the walls, and hundreds of photos of relatives and friends in the cabinets that once held pies, tobacco, costume jewelry and other goods. She still blows the fire whistle every night. `` We had so many fond memories here, that's why I'm glad I stayed,'' she said.

 A tentative, undisclosed settlement was reached today in a lawsuit filed by the widow of astronaut <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, the pilot of the space shuttle Challenger, against the manufacturer of a faulty booster rocket. `` We've resolved the matter subject to working out some details,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Maready </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Adler </PERSON>, a lawyer representing rocket manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said both sides would request that details of the settlement not be disclosed.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> emotionally defended embattled running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> today, telling a veterans organization <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> joined a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> unit with vacancies and never went to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> because his unit was not called there. `` It's true, he did n't go to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> because he was n't called,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention. `` But here's another truth: He did n't go to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and he did n't burn his draft card. Veterans in the audience gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a hearty ovation after the vice president, departing from his prepared text, said he believes <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has been the vicim of `` shrill, partisian attacks.'' `` Let his attackers cast the first stone,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Because I served in combat and because I saw some of my countrymen killed, I salute the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans today, those who fought in the rice paddies,'' he continued. `` I hardly ever walk by the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veterans Memorial in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> when I do n't get a lump in my throat or a tear in my eye. But many others served, too, some in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, some in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> _ people who were not sent overseas.'' Meanwhile, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> reasserted today that he broke no rules nor did anything unfair to get into the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> during the Vietnam War. Appearing on two television talk shows, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also said he did not think it was hypocritical for him to strongly back the war effort and opt to join the Guard at the same time. And he said he is convinced the furor will die down and ca n't wait for that to happen `` Right now, I just sit there and answer questions,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America.'' Asked about `` the question of hypocrisy,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said: `` I do n't think it's hypocritical. There were a lot of people that were in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in my <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> unit that supported the goals of fighting communism in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, but were in the National Guard.'' On <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` I do n't even know what my -LRB- draft lottery -RRB- number was'' at the time he joined the Guard. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> joined the Guard in the summer of 1969. The lottery system of selecting people for the draft took effect Dec. 1 that year. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> posed for photographers in his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> office later in the day, but brushed aside questions about his continuing status on the Republican ticket, saying only: `` I'm <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate.'' As reporters attempted to pepper him with more questions, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said: `` I was a journalist one time. I used to tell people, ` Do n't ever get into an argument with people who buy ink by the barrel. Then, looking at the television cameras surrounding him, he said, `` I'm not going to, even with cameras.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had said earlier he is confident <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will surmount the flap over his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> duty, but that in the meantime, `` I've got to take the heat. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Sunday that he remains upbeat about his election prospects despite questions about the extent to which family influence helped <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> avoid being drafted and got him into law school even though he did n't meet admission requirements. Democratic nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is responding to the controversy by noting that the qualifications of his own vice presidential choice, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, have not come under attack. Otherwise, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has kept to his own campaign themes and today was visiting northeastern <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, a region he often cites when discussing his record of economic development. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had a speech scheduled to a Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was clearly unhappy Sunday with the intense scrutiny of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s background and with Democratic criticism of his own decision-making. He said he's sticking with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, with `` no hesitancy,'' but that the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator needs time `` to get his act together'' before campaigning on his own. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who conducted joint appearances with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> over the weekend, said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will begin campaigning alone `` as soon as he can get squared away'' with a staff and a schedule of appearances. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> stumbled during initial news conferences and interviews after being selected by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last week, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides are spending the early portion of this week trying to prepare him for his first solo campaign appearances, scheduled to begin Wednesday. Throughout their appearances in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, questions continued to be raised about the circumstances of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s enlistment in the Guard at the height of the Vietnam War in 1969 He was 22 then, and described himself at the time as a supporter of the war. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has said that before his student deferment from the draft expired, he discussed with his family his desire to join the Guard. A former top newspaper employee of the family said he interceded with the Guard on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s behalf. Questions also are being raised about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s law school admission. The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported Sunday that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> did not meet the academic requirements of <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law school but got in anyway after meeting with the admissions dean, a Republican judge in a city where <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s family owned the local newspaper. The Plain Dealer quoted <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, as saying his son met with the dean after being initially rejected by the law school. `` He talked his way in,'' the elder <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> dismissed questions about the law school admission by saying, `` I do n't see that there's an enormous demand from the public to learn this guy's high school grades.'' Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., appearing on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet The Press,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> had told him that he believed the military issue was `` pretty much behind them But <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said his own opinion is that `` it's going to last awhile.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said over the weekend that people should notice how few have questioned the qualifications of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to serve as vice president. Other Democrats were quick to challenge <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision-making ability `` Why did <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pick <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>? That's got to be the question,'' <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., said on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Face the Nation'' program `` His first presidential decision was <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' first presidential decision was <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>, also on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, said that if <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is not qualified to be vice president, `` at that point, the real issue is not <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. It's <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his judgment.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, speaking with reporters on Air Force Two, said no thought had been given to asking <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to withdraw, that the 41-year-old senator had not offered to step aside, `` and he should n't.'' `` I want him out campaigning,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` He will have a tremendous appeal to young people, and he'll help with that gender gap. `` He's been thrown into a hornet's nest, but you know, I've been there,'' the vice president said. `` I've got to take the heat. I made the decision. The buck stops right here. I have no hesitancy about it.''

The poll has a three-point margin of error, meaning that if every adult American were asked the same questions, the results theoretically would be within three points of the poll's results, 19 times out of 20. There are other sources of potential error in polls, including the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and responses in this poll; because of rounding, some totals may exceed 100: 1.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has informed the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> support for <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s security remains strong in the wake of the death of President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>. Separate messages were sent to both <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s 11 years of rule ended in an air crash Wednesday in which <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON> and Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wassom </PERSON>, chief of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military group in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, also perished. `` The point is we wanted to reassure them that our policy is unchanged, and that we are going to stand by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>,'' said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who spoke Monday on condition of anonymity. The tone of the messages and conversations here and in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with Soviet diplomats was more pointed than in dealing with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, said a second <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official. `` With the Soviets it was more in terms of cautioning them about <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' said this official, who also spoke anonymously. `` So far, the behavior is quite correct in each case,'' a third <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> under <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> was the closest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally in central <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the conduit for the shipment of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> weapons to Afghan rebels fighting a guerrilla war against the Afghan government and Soviet troops. While the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has complimented caretaker President <PERSON> Ghoulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> about the steps he took after <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s death, including a decision to go ahead with national elections in November, there is concern there could be prolonged instability in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. So far, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said, there is no indication that the Soviets are slowing the pace of their troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> or seizing on the death of <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> to raise tensions in the area. `` Their hostility to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has not ended,'' a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` They have n't backed off. But there is no escalation. I think they understand very clearly our position.'' <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, which has gone to war several times with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> since the 1940s, has strong military ties with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. A funeral service for <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON> was held Monday at the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Myer </LOCATION> chapel in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Peace Talks, Olympic Discussions Break Down Between Koreas</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A third round of talks between delegates from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> about peace and sharing the Olympics broke down Monday with no word on when the two rivals would meet again. The 10 legislators _ five from each side _ ended the talks that began Friday at this village inside the Demilitarized Zone, 35 miles north of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, without indicating there would be another meeting before the Olympics. One top South Korean official said the talks probably would be suspended until after the Sept. 17-Oct. 2 Olympics in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> The two Koreas, bitter neighbors since their land was divided at the end of World War II, refused to budge from their past positions and instead blamed each other for blocking progress. The meeting at a North Korean pavilion in the northern sector of this truce site ended after two hours when both sides said the talks were deadlocked. South Korean chief delegate <PERSON> Park </PERSON> <PERSON> Joon-kyu </PERSON> proposed a private meeting with his communist counterpart to try to resolve the problem. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s delegation withdrew to consider the proposal but did not respond by the set deadline, and the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> delegation returned to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Park </PERSON> said he asked for the private meeting to see if <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was sincere about making headway. `` If there is no hope, we will postpone the next meeting until after the Olympics,'' <PERSON> Park </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Chon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kum </PERSON> <PERSON> Chol </PERSON>, the chief North Korean delegate, said after the meeting that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s `` attitude is anti-unification. Their direction and way of thinking is mistaken.'' <PERSON> Chon </PERSON> held out hope for another meeting but said, `` It all depends on the southern side. It is the South that should make concessions.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> called for urgent talks to be held in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> beginning Aug. 29 to focus solely on trying to resolve the issue of the Olympics. `` I must say the Olympic issue is an urgent and important question and both sides agree that the question should be resolved before the end of August,'' <PERSON> Park </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Chon </PERSON>, in an opening statement before South Korean made its proposal, said separate talks on the Olympics were unacceptable. He said <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> wanted joint discussion of the Olympics and the non-aggression issue. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> offer on the Olympics was contrary to the purpose of the talks. `` The publication of a joint declaration on non-aggression and the 24th Olympic Games are important problems that should be solved together at an early date as they are aimed to remove the confrontation and tension, misunderstanding and distrust between the North and the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>,'' the news agency said in a report monitored in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Still at issue was a North Korean call for a joint meeting of nearly 1,000 members of the two sides' legislatures to discuss its bid to be a co-host of the Olympics and draft a joint declaration on non-aggression. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> also said Monday a formal non-aggression treaty was not necessary because, it contends, the two sides are not separate nations. It called for both sides' parliaments to issue a declaration of non-aggression, which seeks a pullout of 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> says it will boycott the Olympics if it is not allowed to be a co-host. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> fears <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> could use terrorism to disrupt the Olympics. Previous, sporadic talks between the two sides since the early 1970s failed to make progress. The last talks collapsed in January 1986 when <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> pulled out to protest annual South Korean-U.S. military exercises. The Korean peninsula was divided in 1945 by Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces that ended the Japanese occupation at the end of World War II. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> invaded the south in 1950 to start the Korean War, which ended in stalemate in 1953 without a peace treaty being signed.

 Former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> fell to his knees when he and his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>, asked for the forgiveness of charismatic Christians gathered for the <ORGANIZATION> Southeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the Holy Spirit. `` I say let the reconciliation begin,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Coke </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> Garr </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, told the 2,000 participants at a service Sunday at <LOCATION> Owens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Auditorium </LOCATION>. `` I do n't consider this risky,'' <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION>. `` I threw my reputation away when I walked into this room and sat with you.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> grabbed <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> in a long embrace, then fell to his knees onstage. Worshipers pressed forward with cameras to encircle the Pentecostal preacher who built and lost the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministry and its <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> theme park in a sex and money scandal. `` Body of Christ, have you sinned against <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>?'' <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> asked the audience. `` Yes,'' hundreds shouted back. `` Has <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> sinned against you?'' <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> continued. `` Yes,'' the crowd replied. `` Do you forgive him?'' The `` yes'' was drowned out by applause. <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> put the next questions to <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. `` Have you sinned against the body of Christ?'' he asked. `` Yes,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said. `` Will you ask them to forgive you?'' `` Yes,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> replied tearfully. `` Seventeen years ago, I came to this auditorium for the first time,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said. `` The first time I ever ministered in this city was in this room. People rallied and built a network that went around the world. `` I love you, and I have sinned, and I ask you to forgive me.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said he had spent the past year reading the Bible. He said he confessed his sins `` from childhood to this minute'' to a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest he described as a former alcoholic. The Southeastern Congress on the Holy Spirit, which met Thursday through Saturday at <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> at nearby <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, was a follow-up to a national meeting that drew 35,000 charismatics to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> last summer.

<HEAD>Vice President Declares Intention To Lead Opposition Against
Aquino</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> on Monday declared his intention to lead the opposition against President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> after she rejected his call to resign. <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> made his remarks during a news conference in which he likened Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to deposed President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> objected to a statement Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> made Sunday in which she claimed to have a `` contract with God'' to lead the country until her term expires in 1992. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, meanwhile, asked the country's provincial governors to block any coup attempts against her when she visits <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION> next week for a three-day state visit. <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s rejection of his demand to resign and call new elections, which he issued Aug. 13, gave him no choice but to lead the opposition. `` Therefore, as vice president, I will devote my time to voicing out the grievances of our suffering people and lead all those who believe that this nation is entitled to a better government,'' <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has chosen to ignore and evade the issues of incompetence, corruption and lack of leadership that have characterized her administration,'' he charged. `` Once again she regaled the people with promises which for the past 30 months she has consistently disregarded.'' Laurel called for new elections after accusing the Aquino government of incompetence. He said that if she resigned, he would also resign. If not, he said he would remain vice president but `` dissociate'' himself from her government. In a speech Sunday, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> accused unspecified `` enemies of the state'' of trying to destabilize her government. She said she was determined to remain in office and produce economic progress. `` Nothing and no one shall deflect me from this task,'' she said. `` For my mandate is with this nation, not with its enemies. My covenant is with the constitution, our contract is with God.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> had made a similar statement to justify his 20-year rule of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said without elaborating. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> met Monday with 45 provincial governors, during which she discussed efforts to curb corruption, fight poverty and crush the 19-year communist insurgency. She also called on the governors to continue supporting her government during her visit to <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>, which begins next Monday. `` I know that while I am away, you will take care of things, so that my enemies will not try to pull something again,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government has survived at least five coup attempts in the last two years. Executive Secretary <PERSON> Catalino </PERSON> <PERSON> Macaraig </PERSON> said Monday the government was stable enough to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return but would rather he stay away if it had its way. He said the government was leaving the question of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' return to the courts. `` I think the president is confident that the government can cope with whatever events might be triggered by the return of President <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>,'' Macaraig said. But he warned that opponents of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> might try to kill him if he returns. `` The military will have to give him protection,'' he said. `` There is really a problem because there are those who might try to do him harm and put the blame on the president.'' The possibility of a <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> return from his Hawaiian exile surfaced last week when the anti-graft court ruled the ousted president had the right to be present during the court deposition of a former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister set for November. <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> officials accuse <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> of stealing billions of dollars from the treasury during his presidency.

 An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> delegation led by novelist <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sontag </PERSON> plans to dramatize the imprisonment of four South Korean literary figures to try to obtain their release. The 52nd International P.E.N. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which will bring together about 700 writers from Aug. 29 to Sept. 2 in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, plans to introduce a resolution calling on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s government to release the four, a spokeswoman said Monday P.E.N. identified those in prison as publisher <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-bok </PERSON>, writer <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyon-jang </PERSON> and poets <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> San-ha </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nam-ju </PERSON>. Publisher <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sang-bok </PERSON> was released from prison Aug. 15 as part of a general amnesty program. The South Korean P.E.N. Center, which also has pressed for release of the four, scheduled meetings this week with Justice Minister <PERSON> Chong </PERSON> <PERSON> Hae-chang </PERSON> and sent letters to President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo. `` The congress is a good chance to draw atention to this matter worldwide,'' said H.B. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Seoul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and a P.E.N. member. `` We hope this will be the right setting at the right time to press for release.'' <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennerly </PERSON>, executive director of the American P.E.N. Center in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said Monday that while `` we recognize the great strides toward democratization in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, we find it disturbing that four writers and publishers remain in jail. `` We had hoped to come to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to celebrate their release and hoped and expected them to join us, and other colleagues, at the meetings,'' Ms. <PERSON> Kennerly </PERSON> said. She said Ms. <PERSON> Sontag </PERSON> plan to make an appeal to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s government for release of the four at a reception Aug. 30 The delegations of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> are to be co-hosts for the reception. Ms. <PERSON> Sontag </PERSON>, a novelist and essayist, is president of the American chapter of P.E.N. and was one of four human rights activists who sent South Korean President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo a letter July 22 protesting the imprisonments. `` The April 1 sentencing of poet <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> San-ha </PERSON> to 1 -LCB- years in prison for writing a poem is alarming evidence that the practice of censorship _ in its most reprehensible form _ still exists,'' the letter said. `` We note, too, that scores of books are subject to confiscation because of their political content and that films and plays are subject to censorship,'' the letter said. The letter claimed that licensing controls on foreign publications `` severely limit the free flow of information ... limit not only the right of Korean citizens to receive information, but that of the participants in the P.E.N. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' In addition to Ms. <PERSON> Sontag </PERSON>, those who signed the the letter included <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Algrant </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Silberberg </PERSON>, executive director of the Fund for Free Expression and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>, chairman of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> Watch in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Drawing on royal precedent, the <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> and Duchess of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> have named their 2-week-old daughter <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, Buckingham Palace said Monday. The princess' names are from Queen <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON>'s youngest child, the present queen and her mother, and the duke's great-grandmother, <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. The baby, who is at the royal summer retreat in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> with her parents, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>, and the queen, will be known as Her Royal Highness The Princess <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. She is fifth in line to the throne and the first child for the <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> and Duchess of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The announcement of her name ended energetic speculation, which long preceded her Aug. 8 birth. One major bookmaker closed his books for a time when a newspaper quoted <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> as saying one day in May that the baby would be a girl named <PERSON> Annabel </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Annabel </PERSON> continued to remain a favorite among bettors, along with <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>. Not a single bet was placed on <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> at two of the country's largest bookmakers, they said with delight. `` It's terrific. We could n't have chosen a better name,'' said <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> bookmakers, which offered <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> at 100 to 1 odds. `` We cleaned up every which way.'' `` It is a bit of a surprise for everybody,'' said <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> of Coral Bookmakers. `` <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> were the two favorites.'' The only correct entry in the public guessing game came from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s largest-circulation newspaper, the tabloid Sun, which reported all three names Friday. The newspaper said <PERSON> Annabel </PERSON> had been the first choice of <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>, but the queen, who must approve royal names, rejected it as too `` yuppie,'' and suggested <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON>. The last Princess <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> among British royals was the youngest of Queen <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON>'s nine children. The Sun reported the name was royal enough for the queen but unusual enough to please <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks-Baker </PERSON>, publisher of <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>'s Peerage, said <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> was pleased because she likes old-fashioned names. The baby's second name honors her grandmother, the queen, and her great-grandmother, Queen <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>. Her third name, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, is the name of the duke's great-grandmother <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, wife of King <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> V </PERSON>, as well as the middle name of <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrantes </PERSON>. Buckingham Palace said no date had been announced for the christening. Prince <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant, is due to return soon to his ship, <ORGANIZATION> HMS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edinburgh </ORGANIZATION>, in the Far East following a leave of absence.

 An <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> horse-breeder who has never laid eyes on <ORGANIZATION> Tougaloo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> donates a sum to the school every time his mare of the same name wins a race. `` No I've never been to the school,'' said <PERSON> Landon </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>. `` But it just sounds like such a great institution. If they can get people into the mainstream from such underprivileged conditions, that's a great accomplishment.'' Every time <PERSON> Tougaloo </PERSON>, a 5-year-old mare, crosses the wire first, <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>, 64, donates 10 percent of the purse to the predominately black private college in this tiny central <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> town.

Tougaloo is to run again Saturday at Thistledown in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and at <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Downs </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> on Sept. 3. She has won three races in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> this year, raising $ 9,000 for Tougaloo. <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> said he decided to name the horse after the college after receiving promotional literature from the 750-student school. `` The name was so attractive,'' <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> added. `` And what they had to say about the school was even more attractive. I guess I could have just named the horse <PERSON> Tougaloo </PERSON>, but I contacted the school and asked them if I could use their name. In return I told them I would given them 10 percent.'' Tougaloo President <PERSON> Adib </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakir </PERSON> was on hand June 18 in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> when the mare took the $ 60,000 purse at a race at Thistledown. `` A college benefiting from a race horse is a very unique situation,'' said <PERSON> Shakir </PERSON>. `` This is my first time going to the horse races and it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. I ca n't begin to say how appreciative we are of the generosity shown by Mr Knight.'' The school ought to update its mailing list, though. `` I received this literature addressed to C.L. Knight,'' <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> said. `` Well, he was my grandfather, but he died in the 1930s.''

<TEXT>
 A terrorist campaign in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> carried out by agents of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Soviet-backed government accounted for well over half of all incidents of state-sponsored terrorism worldwide last year, according to a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report released Monday. Out of 189 such cases, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> carried out 127 against <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in its campaign of retaliation for <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s backing of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s anti-communist guerrilla movement, the report said. The report was prepared before last Wednesday's incident in which a mysterious plane crash killed Pakistani President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON>, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wassom </PERSON> and 27 others. Pakistani officials suspect sabotage but investigators lack conclusive evidence as to the cause of the crash, which occurred 330 miles south of <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials, insisting on anonymity, said any comment on the cause of the crash would be speculative but added that Afghan agents have to be `` among the suspects'' because of their alleged role in fomenting terrorism in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Diplomats at the Afghan Embassy here were unavailable for comment. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kriesburg </PERSON>, a senior associate at the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION>, said it would be a mistake to assume automatically that Afghan agents were responsible for the crash because <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> had many other enemies. They included some from within the Pakistani military and others who were alienated by his authoritarian rule. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> compilation indicated that Afghan-sponsored terrorist acts almost tripled those of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, listed second with 44. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> was third with 7 terrorist episodes. All told, there were 832 international terrorist incidents last year, according to the study. `` When the Pakistani numbers are subtracted, the number of incidents in the rest of the world declined by almost 10 per cent from 1986 statistics,'' the report said. It said the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> campaign is being waged by the <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION>, known by the acronym WAD. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> said last November that the assassinations and bombings carried out against Pakistani civilians were `` at the behest of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'' but <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has denied the allegation. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Pakistani officials estimate that bombs planted by Afghan agents have killed more than 400 civilians in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The bloodiest incident occurred in July 1987 when three car bombs exploded in the main bazaar of <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>, killing 72 and injuring 260. The report said it is likely that the Soviets have been aware of Afghan operations in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> because of the close ties between WAD and the Soviet intelligence agency, <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>. It said that while some of the material for the explosive devices can be purchased on the black market, other items can be obtained only through Soviet sources. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> estimates that about 1,500 Soviet advisers work with WAD.

<HEAD>Families of Slain Hostages File Criminal Charges against Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BREMEN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Families of two teen-agers slain during last week's two-day bank robbery and hostage drama have filed charges of criminal negligence against police, lawyers said Monday. A week after the series of shootings and chases, the story continued to dominate West German news media. A debate on the incident was scheduled for Wednesday by the local government in <LOCATION> Bremen </LOCATION>, where gunmen <PERSON> Dieter </PERSON> <PERSON> Degowski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hans-Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Roesner </PERSON> hijacked a city bus during the tense standoff. Lawyers <PERSON> Bernd </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenkranz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gerold </PERSON> <PERSON> Bischoff </PERSON> said they filed charges on behalf of the families of hostages <PERSON> Emanuele </PERSON> <PERSON> di </PERSON> <PERSON> Giorgi </PERSON>, 15, and <PERSON> Silke </PERSON> <PERSON> Bischoff </PERSON>, 18. <PERSON> Silke </PERSON> was <PERSON> Gerold </PERSON> <PERSON> Bischoff </PERSON>'s niece. `` The charge is that of negligently causing death due to failure to give assistance,'' <PERSON> Rosenkranz </PERSON> said. Under West German law, prosecutors must investigate the charges to decide whether a trial is warranted. <PERSON> Rosenkranz </PERSON> said the di <PERSON> Giorgi </PERSON> family alleges further that police provoked the gunmen by detaining a female accomplice during the incident, which began Aug. 16 with a bank robbery and hostage-taking in the town of <LOCATION> Gladbeck </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Degowski </PERSON>, 31, shot the Italian youth after police temporarily seized accomplice <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Irma </PERSON> <PERSON> Loeblich </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Grundbergsee </LOCATION> rest stop on the superhighway near <LOCATION> Bremen </LOCATION>. The boy died after trying to protect his 9-year-old sister from the bandits, according to witnesses. The charge also says that police missed several opportunities to end the hostage drama, according to <PERSON> Rosenkranz </PERSON>. After that shooting, <PERSON> Degowski </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Loeblich </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roesner </PERSON> forced the bus to drive to the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> early Thursday. There they freed most of their two dozen hostages and then drove back to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> with the two remaining hostages. On Thursday afternoon, police ended the drama during a pitched battle on a busy highway near <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. Police captured both gunmen and Ms. <PERSON> Loeblich </PERSON>, 34. Ms. <PERSON> Bischoff </PERSON> was killed in what authorities said was a shot fired by either <PERSON> Degowski </PERSON> or <PERSON> Roesner </PERSON>, 32. Her uncle said he had filed charges of criminal negligence against police in <LOCATION> Bremen </LOCATION> and in the state of North-Rhine Westfalia. It escalated into the bus hijacking in <LOCATION> Bremen </LOCATION> 135 miles to the northeast of Gladbeck after police met the gunmen's demands for a getaway car.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> charged Monday that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> favors `` unilateral cuts in our defense'' and said the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat does not understand the `` peace-through-strength'' theme that has guided <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration national security policy. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention, chided <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for saying that he reflects President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s views on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> more closely than the vice president. He also made an impassioned defense of embattled presidential campaign running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, saying the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator has `` been under shrill partisan attack'' over allegations that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, a hawk on defense issues, used family connections to sign up with an <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> unit at the height of the Vietnam War. `` I salute the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veterans here today, those who fought in the rice paddies,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` But others served too, some in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and some in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, and were not sent overseas.'' `` True, he did n't go to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> but his unit was n't sent,'' the vice president said. `` But there's another truth: he did not go to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, he did not burn his draft card and he damned sure did n't burn the American flag I'm proud to have him at my side.'' In an address frequently interrupted by applause by the war veterans, many of them wearing their garrison caps, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of having advocated policies in the past which would have weakened <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s hand in dealing with the Kremlin. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said a president must be committed to keeping <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces modernized, saying only modernization and testing of weapons gives the Soviets `` the incentive to negotiate real arms control agreements.'' He said that `` I plan to negotiate strategic arms reductions with the Soviets. ... But I will not do what my opponent has suggested _ get rid of the MX, the Midgetman, the B-1 bomber and two carrier battle groups. I will not make such unilateral cuts in our defense.'' `` As veterans, you know better than anyone else the terrible cost of war,'' the Republican presidential candidate said. `` I, too, almost lost my life in one.'' `` I think it is fair to ask this morning whether my opponent understands this fundamental truth: that strength deters aggression. That the way to peace is through strength.'' `` Peace through strength works,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign considered the vice president's foreign policy speech the major <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> event of the day. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was traveling to <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, for a Republican rally there. He used much of the <ORGANIZATION> Palmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speech here to criticize <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' statements on national defense policy, particularly the governor's recent suggestion that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> seeks to warm relations with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> argues a harder line to placate conservatives. `` My opponent would have you believe that he's closer to <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on defense policy than I am,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Well, he's about as close to <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on defense as <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> the Pooh is to Refrigerator <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> in the area of bears.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was referring in the latter instance to <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, the more than 330-pound offensive lineman for the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Bears football team. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> long supported a nuclear freeze, but said the governor has stepped away from that position since the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration consummated the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces -LRB- INF -RRB- treaty with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, eliminating a whole class of nuclear missiles. If the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had embraced the nuclear freeze movement, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` it would have locked in Soviet superiority in a range of strategic areas.'' `` It would have prevented us from deploying the Pershing missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` How else would we have convinced the Soviets that we were serious about having them remove their thousand SS-20 warheads at a time when we had none.'' `` In the microwave oven of the campaign, my opponent's position on the freeze has started to melt, in belated recognition of the fact that our policies are working,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also chided <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for opposing the participation by <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> in construction of an emergency communications system for use by a president in the event of an attack. `` Only one governor refused to have a -LRB- Ground Wave Emergency Network -RRB- site in his state _ the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that he is pleased to see reform coming about in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must not let down its guard in dealing with the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> was right. He's -LRB- Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> -RRB- got a nice smile. He's also got iron teeth. And one major reason why he favors agreements now is because we're strong.'' `` We're not out of the woods yet,'' he said. `` The Soviets are now deploying two new ICBMs, the SS-24 and SS-25. So even with perestroika, Soviet military modernization, including their own research into strategic defense, has not slackened.''

 Farmers leaving for 10 days of harvesting free hay in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> boarded buses in a downpour Monday, providing hope that their own drought-ravaged pastures might be green by the time they get home. `` But it will still take several weeks for that forage to grow back up, assuming we get enough rain, and even then you wonder what kind of growth there will be,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spokesman </ORGANIZATION>, a publication of the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. `` The drought has killed off part of it, and then if you have a frost the first part of October, that will curb things a little bit, too,'' he said. About 60 farmers boarded two chartered buses for the trip, hoping to harvest a train load of hay from reserve acreage. `` A lot of these guys really need the hay, so they made a quick decision to come. Some people hired people to go in their place,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. The venture is a cooperative effort of the <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, with Greyhound donating the buses, <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> railroad donating freight space for the baled hay and three banks in <LOCATION> Chariton </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, putting up cash for meals along the way. <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON> said he expects other banks will also chip in. In spite of the donated services, organizer <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON> said he initially had trouble recruiting a crew for the excursion because the drought has made it even more difficult for farmers to leave home for extended periods. <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON>, a regional manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>'s office in <LOCATION> Chariton </LOCATION>, said many farmers were reluctant to commit a week to 10 days because the drought makes it necessary for them to haul water and feed to cattle. But when word spread, he said, the first bus filled up quickly and the second bus was filled nearly as fast. In addition, he said, about 15 more farmers will leave for <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> later this week. <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> offered unlimited hay to drought-stricken farmers if they would supply the labor for the harvest. The hay will come from private fields ordinarily idled under the federal government's Conservation Reserve Program but freed because of the drought. <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON> said he was told that 200 tons of hay already has been shipped to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and that he hoped Iowans could fill a freight train. `` I do n't know how much we can harvest, but if we've got 75 guys out there on modern machinery haying all day, that's a lot of hay,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON> said first priority for the hay will go to those making the trip. Those next in line will be farmers needing hay but unable for physical or other reasons to go to <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, including an elderly couple that <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON> said were feeding their cattle by cutting down trees so the animals can eat the foliage. `` The lady is about 70 and said she can run machinery and wanted to go while her husband, about 75, stayed behind,'' <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON> said. `` I would n't let her go but I'm going to make darn sure they get some hay.''

 Safety features in the redesigned space shuttle booster rocket appear to have performed as designed during a crucial test-firing despite deliberately incorporated flaws, a spokesman said Monday. The test was the fifth and final full-scale firing needed to qualify the solid-fuel booster for flight. Engineers from <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> have torn down the aft skirting and nozzle section of the 126-foot-long rocket that was fired last Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>'s plant 25 miles west of <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said company spokesman <PERSON> Rocky </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON>. `` Everything continues to look very, very good,'' <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said of the weekend examinations. `` No problems whatever were uncovered ... From what they've seen so far, it looks like the best nozzle yet.'' If the positive evaluation of the rocket holds, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials have said they expect to set a firm launch date in late September or early October for the first shuttle flight since Challenger exploded on Jan. 28, 1986. Engineers also examined the test booster's nozzle section, looking for any indications of unexpected failure in features designed to contain super-hot exhayst gases, <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said. A NASA-designed nozzle component failed during the second of five qualifying firings last December. Subsequent test-firings incorporated a <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> nozzle design that had been successfully used in the first full-scale test in August 1987 _ and has performed well since. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> grounded the shuttle program after the Challenger disaster in which seven astronauts died. A presidential commission blamed the disaster on a faulty booster seal between segments of one booster which allowed exhaust to escape sideways and ignite the spacecraft's external liquid fuel tank. <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said detailed inspection and analysis of the tested rocket will continue through the rest of the month, with engineers removing another of the booster's four segments about every two days. `` We should be able to remove the aft segment about Thursday, allowing them to look at the most-flawed field joint. There will be extensive documentation and testing done when they break that joint,'' <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said. `` They should finish up about two weeks after the firing,'' he said, adding that final <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> clearance for the booster's use should come shortly after that. Last week's $ 20 million test-firing was the climax of <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>'s 2 -LCB- - year, $ 470 million effort to redesign the solid-fuel rocket For the test-firing, two of the three joints, the case-to-nozzle joint and the igniter-to-case joint were riddled with 14 intentional flaws. <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> officials said the flaws were intended to test the new booster's safety features to their limits. The third joint was left unflawed in order to serve as a comparison, <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said. Among the defects were separations in bonded adhesive insulation that helps hold the joints together, and channels cut to allow gases to reach the joint's middle O-ring _ one of three gaskets designed to contain heat from the burning fuel during a launch.

 The <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> dilemma, revolving generally around questions of inexperience and privilege, has ensnarled <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at a critical moment and threatens the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate's appeal to the `` Reagan Democrats'' who helped make him what he is today. The emerging image of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as an overindulged rich kid is not so much <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s problem as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s: the issues reflect as much on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s judgment in 1988 as <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s judgment as a 22-year-old in 1969. While decrying the `` shrill partisan attacks'' against <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> apparently ca n't answer the <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> questions himself. Last Friday he was asked by Time magazine if the media was overreacting to the Quayle questions, and said: `` Yes. Damn right. But I do n't know what the facts are. I have to wait and see what facts are driving this.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would rather be talking about his `` L-word,'' the brand of Democratic liberalism he associates with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and now <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. But the <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> matter makes that practically impossible; in political terms, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has lost control of the agenda. `` I wish all this were n't churning around out there,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told Time. `` It's distracting attention from the campaign itself.'' Republican activists across the country have been supportive of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, while the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> GOP establishment is openly wary. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Stram </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, calls the <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> controversy `` peripheral,'' and says voters deserve to hear a clear dialogue between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. She complained that TV coverage of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s big night in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> last Thursday could be summed up: `` He gave a good speech. And the latest on the <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> story is ...'' House Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, asked if <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> should be taken off the ticket, said Monday, `` If there was something additional that came up that was a distraction or a disqualification, well, the option's always there. But I do n't see it at this juncture.'' Was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> a mistake? `` I'm not going to call it a mistake yet,'' he said, adding, `` Once you've committed yourself to a role, you pretty much have to see it through.'' A similar not-too-ringing endorsement came Sunday from <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, the World War II combat hero who apparently ran second in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vice presidential deliberations. He embraced the ticket again, but said, `` Right now I'd guess there are a number of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Democrats who are going to remain undecided or maybe go the other way -LRB- to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> -RRB-. `` I mean, they're out there in my little hometown,'' he said of these crossover voters who put <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in office, `` And I must tell you, in my generation you knew who was in the Guard and who was in uniform fighting for their country. So they're very sensitive about it _ they did n't have anybody they could call ... Well, my father wore overalls, who's he going to influence?'' Most recent surveys indicate <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leads <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> among the Reagan-Democrats already; the scent of special privilege ca n't help among the overall and blue-collar voters that <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> refers to. Today, the questions of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> privilege amount to this: Did <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> use unusual family influence to get into the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, thereby ducking the draft and an almost certain ticket to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>? Did Quayle trade on family influence to get into <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> after being a `` proverbial C + student,'' as an undergraduate `` There's been nothing that has been substantiated that any rules were violated, that we did anything that was unfair,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said Monday in response to questions about his entry to law school and the guard. On another matter, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was asked last week what executive experience had prepared him to become vice president, and cited, among other things, his work in the attorney general's office while attending law school at night. Now questions are being raised as to how the young <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> landed this job. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s father says an influential family employee got <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> an interview with the attorney general. These matters caught off-guard a presidential campaign that is bragging about its competence and had since March 8 to evaluate the many Republicans who might add to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ticket. Did Quayle mislead the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> interviewers? Did <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his people ask the right questions? However voters eventually decide to judge the Quayle candidacy, answering these questions is not the way <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hoped to take advantage of the momentum he earned Thursday night in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. Conservative columnists <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and <PERSON> Novak </PERSON> described the <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> questions as a `` skunk at the picnic.''

<HEAD>Preaching Strode Child Suspended On First Day Of School</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARION, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A street-preaching 11-year-old was told to go home on the first day of school Monday after reportedly telling his principal to `` go to hell.'' `` I have trouble when a child says -LRB- that -RRB- to an authority figure,'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorst </PERSON>, principal of <ORGANIZATION> Eastfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Strode </PERSON>, said his son, <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON>, had told <PERSON> Gorst </PERSON> `` you'll go to hell.'' School officials said the boy's message was a more blunt `` you go to hell.'' After <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> was suspended for 10 days, <PERSON> Strode </PERSON> took all three of his children home, and said he did not know whehter they would try to go to school on Tuesday. Before classes opened, school officials said they would not permit classes to be disrupted as they were last year when <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> staked out a back entrance of the school and yelled out Bible verses condemning `` whoremongers'' and `` fornicators.'' The boy yelled at the principal after a sheriff's deputy tried to escort the children onto the grounds of the school, said Strode. When a deputy took the hand of Pepper, 7, she screamd and <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> `` became enraged,'' said the father, who watched the proceedings from outside the school gates. `` They -LRB- school officials -RRB- wanted to provoke those children and they did,'' Strode said. <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>, the assistant principal, said the school had videotaped the incident, as it has done in previous instances of <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON>'s preaching. She said the recording indicated the boy told <PERSON> Gorst </PERSON>, `` you go to hell.'' `` The issue here is God and the devil,'' Strode said. `` The gods of the public school system are <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON>. Their religion is this _ humanism, evolution, integration. That's why they do n't want the kids promoting the King <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bible </PERSON> around the school anywhere.'' <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> was suspended for disruptive and disrespectful behavior, Ms. <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> said. She said a year-long suspension `` can be enacted at any point.'' `` School officials have simply said at this point that they will not have this continue for the year,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> said. Strode and his wife, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON>, were notified Friday they had been banned from school property. The Weavers, family friends, were to escort the children from the gate to the school building, but officials instead ordered the deputies to take the children. After the confrontation between the boy and the principal, <PERSON> Gorst </PERSON> asked Strode to bring his children into school. Strode said he refused and walked off with the three children. At that point, <PERSON> Gorst </PERSON> asked him to bring the younger children back, saying only <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> was suspended, Strode said. `` They just do n't want <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> at school, period,'' he said. `` Pepper, she's scared to death now.'' <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> were preaching on their way to the school grounds, <PERSON> Strode </PERSON> said. Pepper, who did not preach last year, yelled `` repent'' a couple of times, Strode said. All three had book bags on their backs and Bibles in their hands, he said.

<HEAD>Reagan Signs Law On Nuclear Power</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Monday signed legislation increasing significantly the liability of nuclear power companies for compensation of the public in the event of an accident. The bill extends for 15 years a law passed in the 1970s designed to provide such protection. The new law, like the old one, requires private insurance of $ 150 million per reactor. It increases from $ 5 million to $ 63 million per reactor the second-tier insurance, provided by the federal government. Altogether, the amount of compensation available in the event of a nuclear accident would be increased to over $ 7 billion. The act that is being extended also `` makes feasible commercial nuclear power generation,'' the president said. `` I sign this legisaltion in the midst of a summeer that has brought record temperatures to much of our country,'' the president said. `` As a consequence, many of our utilities find themselves near the limits of their power-generating capacity.'' `` The implication of this situation is clear: Our nation must move forward into a new era of safe, economical and clean nuclear power,'' he added.

 A fisherman reeling in his hook found sticks of dynamite instead of a fish, and that led to a search in which police believe they have recovered dynamite stolen last month at gunpoint.

 New knowledge of Arctic weather, currents and ice drift and analysis of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s documents indicate the explorer hailed as the first person to reach the North Pole may have missed the mark by 30 to 60 miles, a British Arctic expert says.

The Peary controversy was reopened by <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> in the September issue of National Geographic magazine and summarized Monday by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, which had bought exclusive rights to <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s original story. The newspaper's money helped pay for the expedition. But it was the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, then an elite scientific group whose journal grew into one of the world's most popular magazines, that certified <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s achievement and dismissed the rival claim of Dr. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, who said he reached the pole a year earlier. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> had sold his story to the Times' rival, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. But his journals were lost in transit from the Arctic to his home. <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s diary and other documents of his 1909 expedition, held in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, were opened to scholars recently by the <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> family. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> noted that the diary entry for April 6, 1909, the day <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> is supposed to have reached the pole, made no mention of it, but a loose page was inserted that proclaimed, `` The pole at last!!!'' According to the account of <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s aide de camp, <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> showed no desire to celebrate on his return to the base camp after their five-day sprint to the pole with four Eskimos. <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> turned away with both hands covering his eyes when <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> went to shake his hand. <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>, who was the first black polar explorer, may actually have reached the pole first, if either of them did, since he scouted in front of <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>. <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> published his journal in 1912 and it caused a falling out with <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>, who had wanted only his observations to be published. <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s diary contained no detailed record of wind speed, weather and ice conditions during the crucial 30 hours when he reportedly made his sprint to the Pole. Neither did it record the systematic sextant readings necessary to determine one's position relative to the sun, <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> also noted that `` his chronometer _ critical in navigation _ was 10 minutes fast, an error he was not aware of while on the ice ... This alone could have put him west of the pole by 18 miles.'' No explorer since <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> has matched his claimed speed over the polar ice pack. <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> said he made the 296-mile round trip by dogsled from base camp to pole in eight days, with 198 miles covered in four days.

 The White House declined comment Monday on the controversy surrounding <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, saying only that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> `` is the vice presidential candidate and he's a good one.'' Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he had no comment on the prediction of Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., that the issue of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s enlistment in the National Guard during the Vietnam War `` is going to last awhile. Asked whether President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> believed <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> should be dropped from the ticket, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> replied, `` It is not a relevant question. `` Senator <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is the vice presidential candidate and he's a good one,'' the spokesman said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has not talked with Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> since making a brief telephone call to him after his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> last Thursday. He said the two would have a chance to confer, perhaps for half an hour or an hour, prior to a joint appearance in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on Wednesday. He did not speculate on what they would talk about. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s principal role in the fall campaign will be to `` draw distinctions between liberals and conservatives, between Democrats and Republicans.'' He said four or five appearances had already been scheduled and somewhere between eight and 15 are expected. He said the president would go to the South, the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, the West and `` all around the country.'' The president and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, will leave Tuesday for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and return to their ranch north of here on Saturday, staying until Sept. 6, when they return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. On his way to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, the president will stop at <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to sign a bill designed to reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deficits in world trade. Asked whether it was politically embarrassing to the president that the prime sponsor of the bill was Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said it was not. `` Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> did a good job with this,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` He has worked on it a lot of years, and so have we.''

<HEAD>Sasson Jeans Creator Surrenders, Ordered Held Without Bail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The creator of the bankrupt <PERSON> Sasson </PERSON> jeans empire surrendered Monday and was ordered held without bail for violating an agreement that had freed him while he awaited trial for allegedly threatening the life of a judge. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Guez </PERSON>, who gave himself up to federal marshals, had disappeared last week while free on $ 100,000 bond, then appeared without his lawyers before the judge he is accused of threatening. <PERSON> Guez </PERSON> appeared before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON>, who rejected the defendant's argument that he misunderstood the arrangement that allowed him to come to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> last week to attend to bankruptcy proceedings. `` I find your account of how confused you were unconvincing,'' <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON> said. The restrictions were `` reasonable and perfectly obvious. They would have been obvious to a child.'' <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON> had revoked <PERSON> Guez </PERSON>'s bail and issued a warrant for his arrest Friday after the government said <PERSON> Guez </PERSON> violated the conditions of his release after his arrest in May for threatening the life of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON>. After his release, <PERSON> Guez </PERSON> was sent to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where he spent 28 days in a drug rehabilitation center. Since getting out he has been staying with relatives in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area. Early last week, <PERSON> Guez </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on the condition that he remain in the custody of one of his two lawyers. But the lawyers lost track of him Wednesday and <PERSON> Guez </PERSON> appeared before <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> on Thursday without the lawyers. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> notified Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Childers </PERSON>. <PERSON> Guez </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON>, argued Monday that his client did not `` willfully violate the terms of his bail,'' and had remained in close contact with another lawyer, <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleizer </PERSON>. According to federal prosecutors, <PERSON> Guez </PERSON>, 43, threatened to kill <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> and the trustee he appointed to oversee <PERSON> Sasson </PERSON>'s reorganization `` if a result contrary to his interest were to be reached. The Tunisian-born <PERSON> Guez </PERSON> arrived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1976 with $ 74 and a new style of French cut jeans. Through clever advertising he made millions, also licensing the Sasson label for watches, lingerie and luggage. But the company, beset by to internal feuds, was swamped by lawsuits leading to the Chapter 11 reorganization.

<HEAD>Drought-Stricken Farmers Reminded of Reserve Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Farmers hit hard by this year's drought should think about enrolling highly erodible cropland in the long-term Conservation Reserve Program, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The current signup period for the <ORGANIZATION> CRP </ORGANIZATION> will end on Aug. 31. More than 25.5 million acres have been enrolled in previous signups, and the goal is to have 40 million to 45 million acres in the program by the end of 1990. Under the program, farmers offer bids to take land from crop production and plant it to grass or trees for 10 years as a guard against erosion. In return, they get federal assistance to pay for up to half of the cost of establishing the protective cover, plus annual rental payments for the <ORGANIZATION> CRP </ORGANIZATION> land. <PERSON> Vern </PERSON> <PERSON> Neppl </PERSON>, acting executive vice president of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said farmers may bid to enroll eligible land that has not been harvested in 1988 due to drought `` If their bids are accepted, the producers will receive their first CRP rental payments in 1988,'' <PERSON> Neppl </PERSON> said. `` Also, they will be guaranteed payments for nine more years, an additional source of income regardless of weather condition during those years.'' Cropland that has been hayed in counties approved for drought relief is eligible for the <ORGANIZATION> CRP </ORGANIZATION> if it meets program requirements, but there may be a reduction in the 1988 payment, <PERSON> Neppl </PERSON> said. Producers also have the option of enrolling land for 1989. Enrollment of erodible land in the <ORGANIZATION> CRP </ORGANIZATION> will help farmers meet the conservation provisions of the 1985 farm law, <PERSON> Neppl </PERSON> said. Those require producers to have an approved conservation plan for erodible land in place by Jan. 1, 1990, to remain eligible for <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> program benefits.

<HEAD>Six Accused Of Training Contra Mercenaries in Florida</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Six Cuban-Americans ran a mercenary training camp in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to aid Nicaraguan rebels, according to a federal indictment unsealed Monday. One of the six is also accused of shipping a cannon, a mortar and other weapons to Contras under the guise of humanitarian aid. The Miami-area men allegedly violated the Neutrality Act, which bans private action against a government at peace with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The indictment alleges that the defendants operated from June 1983 to September 1986. `` There is no declared war against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnapp </PERSON> said. `` People do n't have the option to go down there and engage in combat on their own.'' <PERSON> Eulalio </PERSON> <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> `` Frank'' <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, 46, one the two men who allegedly financed the 60-man training camp on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, had been arrested here in June 1983 for allegedly smuggling loads of marijuana by sea, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hook </PERSON> said Monday. The mercenary camp allegedly began operations the same month, and the charges against <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> were subsequently dismissed. <PERSON> Hook </PERSON> said he did not know why the charges were dropped. <PERSON> Schnapp </PERSON> turned away questions about a possible drug link to the <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> aid operations, which has been the subject of congressional investigations. `` There is no allegation of any drug shipment involved in any of this,'' <PERSON> Schnapp </PERSON> said. Also indicted was <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Corvo </PERSON>, who has been accused by some witnesses before congressional committees of engaging in drug traffic. A 1986 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report said there was no information connecting <PERSON> Corvo </PERSON>'s group in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to drug smuggling. <PERSON> Corvo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Becerra </PERSON> turned themselves in Monday before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate Lurana Snow in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, while agents were trying to contact the other two defendants, <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Corvo </PERSON> faces the most serious charges in the indictment, which was prepared by the same federal grand jury that indicted Contra leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, ex-mercenary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON> and others on similar charges. <PERSON> Corvo </PERSON> faces a maximum 38 years in prison on four weapons charges plus counts of violating the Neutrality Act and conspiring to violate it. The other five face only the Neutrality Act violations, and face a maximum eight years in prison. In March 1985 <PERSON> Corvo </PERSON> allegedly shipped nine weapons to <ORGANIZATION> Costa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> anti-Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> groups through <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, and faces federal weapons counts, <PERSON> Schnapp </PERSON> said. One shipment allegedly landed on the ranch of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>, a one-time <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> contact, according to congressional witnesses and other reports. <PERSON> Schnapp </PERSON> said questions about <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>, if any, would be forwarded to the special prosecutor's office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` There was a portion of the overall investigation of individuals who were facilitating Contra activities that was turned over to the special prosecutor's office,'' <PERSON> Schnapp </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> are accused of financing the camp's operations, while <PERSON> Corvo </PERSON> and the other three allegedly trained mercenaries, mostly Cubans and Nicaraguans, at the camp The activities were apparently not secret, and the camp was filmed in 1985 by a television crew, <PERSON> Schnapp </PERSON> said. Some of the defendants in the earlier case have argued their activities were sanctioned and even directed by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. They have a motion before <PERSON> Roettger </PERSON> asking him to decide if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was really at peace with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, as is required under the act. <PERSON> Schnapp </PERSON> said the new indictment did not include any evidence that the men were acting on behalf of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` The indictment would indicate that they were not sanctioned,'' said <PERSON> Schnapp </PERSON>. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, who pleaded guilty to Neutrality Act violations in the earlier indictment, was sentenced to one day's probation by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Roettger </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Federal Authorities File Suit To Deport Man Accused of War Crimes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal authorities have begun deportation proceedings against a <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> man accused of crimes during World War II. In a civil lawsuit filed in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Monday, authorities allege that <ORGANIZATION> Edgars </ORGANIZATION> Inde, 79, a native of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, belonged to a commando unit known as the <ORGANIZATION> Latvian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auxiliary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, a Nazi-approved organization subordinate to German authorities. Federal authorities allege that as a member of that organization, Inde participated in killing unarmed Jews and other civilians in 1941 and 1942. When contacted Monday, Inde denied he killed Jews. `` No, no, no, no, no, no,'' he said. The lawsuit was filed against Inde by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attorney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> and the Office of Special Investigations. The suit is the first in a series of steps to revoke Inde's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship and deport him, the attorney's office said in a statement. The suit alleges that Inde hid his participation in war crimes when he came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> 1949 and applied for naturalization. Inde became a citizen in 1955. `` Because of his wartime activities and later misrepresentations, Inde lacked the good moral character required to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and become a citizen,'' <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney for <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, said in a statement. `` During the war he assisted in the persecution of thousands of innocent citizens on behalf of a country hostile to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and democracy.'' Inde, a retired factory worker, said Monday he wants to remain in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> is under Soviet control. He referred questions to <PERSON> Ivars </PERSON> <PERSON> Berzins </PERSON>, a Babylon, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, attorney. <PERSON> Berzins </PERSON> could not be reached for comment Monday, but a secretary said he does not discuss his clients' cases. Inde has 20 days to respond to the charges. <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sher </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigations </ORGANIZATION>, said the agency also is prosecuting others who allegedly served with Inde during World War II. <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> said the founder and former chief of the commando unit, <PERSON> Viktors </PERSON> <PERSON> Arajs </PERSON>, was sentenced to life imprisonment in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> following his conviction of mass murder. `` <ORGANIZATION> OSI </ORGANIZATION>'s investigations and prosecutions have resulted in the removal of 19 Nazi persecutors from this country,'' <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> said. Twenty-nine people have had their citizenship revoked, 27 cases are in litigation and more than 600 are under investigation, <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Sun Doesn't Set on Pub Drinkers in Britain</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Britannia </PERSON>'s waves of bitter and stout flowed unabated Monday _ even after <PERSON> Big </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> chimed 3 o'clock _ as drinkers toasted the new laws that went into effect permitting pubs to stay open throughout the day. Ever since 1915, when the government moved to curb drinking by munitions workers, all pubs, wine bars and hotel bars have been required to stop serving alcohol between 3 p.m. and 5:30 p.m.. Now they can serve beer, wine and spirits uninterrupted from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. on weekdays On Sundays, which have always had the shortest drinking hours, alcohol now can be served from noon to 3 p.m. _ a one-hour extension _ and from 7 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. `` It gives us new freedom,'' said <PERSON> Elton </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouna </PERSON>, manager of the Sea Horse pub in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s financial district. `` It does n't treat us like children anymore.'' Celebrating bankers and stockbrokers jammed the pub at 3 p.m. when <PERSON> Big </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON>'s chimes were broadcast live and town crier <PERSON> Alfie </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> put down his pint of beer to give the new laws his stamp of approval. `` Oyez! Oyez! Oyez! With the authority invested in me as official town crier, I am commanded to announce that in accordance with the licensing laws of Her Britannic Majesty, from this time, 3 o'clock henceforth, licensees shall dispense beverages for sale,'' he cried. In <LOCATION> Exeter </LOCATION> in southeastern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, landlord <PERSON> Shaun </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> turned the Mill on the Exe pub into a makeshift office to persuade patrons they could do business there. He brought in mobile telephones, photocopiers and faxing facilities, and drafted extra staff to act as secretaries. `` With portable phones and other modern gadgets, many executives do not need to be in the office to work, and a pub is often a more relaxed place for a business meeting,'' <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> said. `` I would hope to see business people using the pub for late lunches and teatime meetings,'' he said. `` This is only an experiment ... but if it works out we will try to arrange these facilities permanently.'' Customer <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Collyer </PERSON>, a company director, said: `` I have always liked doing business in the pub, and with the new hours it can become my second office. It's a lot less formal, and it's easier for your clients to relax, especially now that you do n't have to keep one eye on your watch.'' For the past 73 years, the bartender's warning bellow of `` Last orders!'' has created an instant traffic jam at exactly 2:50 p.m. as patrons clamored for one last drink before heading back to work. Ten minutes later, to the cry of `` Time, gentlemen, please!'' _ men still outnumber women in pubs _ <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> went dry for 2 -LCB- hours. Britons grew accustomed to the ritual, but it confounded parched tourists interested in sampling traditional English ale or having an afternoon snack. `` They just can not physically understand it,'' <PERSON> Mouna </PERSON> said. `` They ca n't work it out. So now we wo n't have those problems. We can just welcome guests in, and entertain them as we've always wanted to.'' Pubs do n't have to change their hours if they do n't want to, and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Licensed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victuallers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> predicted that almost half the 67,000 pubs in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> would stick to the old ways. Publicans and brewers agreed that pubs in seaside and tourist towns and city bars will benefit most from increased trade, while residential and country pubs probably would continue to call `` time'' on weekdays at 3 p.m. `` I think most people in the neighborhood are going to stay open, as I am, for a couple of months to see what difference it makes,'' said <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Brightman </PERSON>, landlord of the Rising Sun pub in central <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Brewers </ORGANIZATION>' Society forecast at least 25,000 new jobs would be generated by the longer drinking hours and that pubs would win back lost trade from fast-food outlets. Many pub managers say they'll expand their food menu and some have even bought coffemakers for the first time. The <PERSON> Sherlock </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> pub near <LOCATION> Trafalgar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> began serving traditional afternoon teas. The British <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and anti-drinking groups oppose the extended hours, fearing increased alcohol-related illness and drink-related crime. The Scottish Office said the extended pub hours introduced in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> more than a decade ago had little impact on the amount of alcohol abuse. Home Office Minister <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogg </PERSON> said he saw no connection between alcohol abuse and the ending of the compulsory afternoon closing time, and many pub-goers applauded the demise of the 2:50 dash for one last drink. `` People would pile drinks into them because they knew that they would n't be able to get another so-called social drink until later in the evening,'' said newspaper researcher <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. `` People are n't going to rush to finish their drinks.'' added her colleague, <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>. `` People will drink at a more leisurely and sensible pace.''

 Israeli troops shot and wounded 13 Arabs Monday during a strike called to protest Israeli tax raids. The Palestinian guerrilla group led by <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> claimed responsibility for a bombing in the city of <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION> that injured 25 people. A Palestinian also died of wounds suffered in a clash with troops a day earlier, bringing to 252 the Arab death toll in the eight-month rebellion in Israeli-occupied territories. Four Israelis have died. The worst violence erupted in the coastal <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where troops opened fire to disperse hundreds of stone-throwing protesters at the Shati and Jabaliya refugee camps, Arab hospital officials said. Eleven Palestinians ranging in age from 11 to 21 were shot and wounded in the clashes, the hospital officials said. Two suffered serious injuries and were transferred to an Israeli hospital. Two protesters were also shot and wounded in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, one in the town of <LOCATION> Nur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shams </LOCATION> and one in the town of <LOCATION> Zawiyeh </LOCATION>. The army imposed a curfew on <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city, and surrounding refugee camps following violent protests overnight. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, meanwhile, condemned as an `` outrageous terrorist act'' the grenade attack Saturday night on a crowded pedestrian mall in <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>. Twenty-five people were wounded in the bombing, including an 8-year-old boy who lost his left leg below the knee. Four Palestinians from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION> are being held in connection with the attack. In a statement published Monday in the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspaper An-Nahar, <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was in revenge for the April 16 assassination of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> military commander <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, also known as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON>. Israeli officials have acknowledged privately that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> carried out the assassination. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, head of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> the <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION> attack `` shows again that this struggle -LRB- the uprising -RRB- ... is not for certain territories under Israeli rule, but against the security and existence of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' But <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s political rival, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> of the left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the attack was not linked to the uprising. `` I think this has nothing to do with the intefadeh -LRB- Arabic for uprising -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists denied <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s claim that the goal of the uprisng was to eliminate <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` The purpose of the intefadeh is not to destroy <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> people, but to establish a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state and end the occupation,'' read leaflets distributed Monday in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. The leaflets, written in <LOCATION> Hebrew </LOCATION> and Arabic, also called on <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers to refuse service in the occupied lands. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, wall posters appeared overnight expressing <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> defiance of harsh Israeli measures against firebomb throwers, including house demolitions and deportations. `` We're not afraid. Our young will continue to throw firebombs,'' said the posters, which showed youths hurling stones and bottles at Israeli jeeps. Streets were deserted and stores shuttered in the occupied lands Monday, the second day of a strike called by undergropund leaders to protest raids in which Israelis confiscate property of Arabs refusing to pay taxes. Tax boycotts have been a key source of resistance to Israeli rule during the uprising. A court extended the detention of two Israeli Jews suspected of setting fire to a shack near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, killing three Palestinians. A fistfight broke out outside the courthouse when the suspects scuffled with a television cameraman, breaking his camera, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharnobi </PERSON>, 22, of the Askar refugee camp near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> died Monday of a bullet wound in the stomach. He was shot Sunday night by plainclothes Israeli agents. The army confirmed the death and said security forces had entered the camp to try to prevent expected riots during a strike.

 The caretaker cabinet of the late President <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> agreed Monday to continue his policies, and government officials denied recurring rumors of a military takeover. <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON> <PERSON> Patel </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> said, `` We are hearing the rumors but there is no basis to them.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Gen. <PERSON> Cloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfister </PERSON> led a group of American investigators to the site of the C-130 airplane crash that killed <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON> and 28 other people on Wednesday. American and Pakistani crash experts searched the debris to determine what caused the transport plane to explode minutes after takeoff near the Indian border. Caretaker President <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chairman who became the new leader by constitutional succession, says he is convinced the crash was caused by saboteurs. <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, 73, held his second Cabinet meeting Monday. <PERSON> Patel </PERSON> said the Cabinet `` discussed the continuation of Islamization,'' the process set in motion by <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> to make the Moslem Koranic code of justice the law of the land. Although there was no official statement, <PERSON> Patel </PERSON> said the cabinet decided to continue <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s policies, including support of the Moslem insurgents fighting the Soviet-backed government in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Several officials and Pakistani newspapers reported hearing rumors of the imposition of martial law and the arrest of <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> or of Army Chief of Staff Gen. <PERSON> Aslam </PERSON> <PERSON> Baig </PERSON>. Authorities said nothing was afoot. There have been no reports of unrest since <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s death ended his 11-year rule. <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> said a state of emergency was in effect but said it had not been necessary to invoke martial law or restrict civil rights. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has informed the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> in separate messages sent to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> support for <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> remains strong in the wake of <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s death. `` The point is we wanted to reassure them that our policy is unchanged, and that we are going to stand by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>,'' said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who spoke Monday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> under <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> was the closest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally in central <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the conduit for the shipment of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> weapons to Afghan rebels fighting a guerrilla war against the Afghan government and Soviet troops.

<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Monday urged voters to compare his selection of a running mate to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice when weighing their vote for president He also said he was eager to debate his Republican opponent on foreign policy and national security issues. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has shied away from direct criticism of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s selection of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to round out the Republican ticket but on Monday said it `` obviously will be an issue'' in the election. `` How we make our decisions, how we make the presidential selections, who we select ... whether or not that person should be a heartbeat away from the presidency, obviously will be an an issue in the campaign,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told a news conference in <LOCATION> Lowell </LOCATION> during a gubernatorial trip to northeastern <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. `` This is a judgment the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people will have to make,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who last week touted the credentials of his running mate, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, as a way of questioning <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s judgment in picking <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> `` They've had an opportunity now to watch <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> make his selection and <PERSON> Geoge </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> make his decision,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` And they will judge us on this and other issues.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for not yet agreeing to a debate schedule and asked that the first face-to-face confrontation be devoted to national security and foreign policy. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has frequently criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a novice at national security and foreign policy and did so again Monday. `` How someone who sat there and did nothing while we sold arms to the ayatollah can seriously talk about leadership in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> is beyond me,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. The governor filled his visit with references to his higher ambitions, touting state health insurance, economic development and housing programs as models he would promote nationally if elected president. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was returning to his <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION> home tonight for a briefing on national security issues to be led by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> also was to attend the briefing, one of a series the presidential and vice presidential nominees will receive before the election. Rep. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>,, and Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, its former chairman, also were invited. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>, were to have dinner with the Dukakises prior to the briefing. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides said the governor's home would be checked for electronic surveillance devices prior to the session <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also issued a statement supporting demonstrations in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in favor of the outlawed Solidarity trade union, referring to Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> as the ` true leader of the Polish people.'' The visit by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to northeastern <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, which he will resume Tuesday, is part of his annual summer tradition of visiting different regions of the state. As he did with a trip last week to central <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> began the visit at a luncheon with area officials, educators and business and labor leaders before attending state events that mesh with themes of his presidential campaign. In <LOCATION> Lowell </LOCATION>, a once-thriving mill city that fell on extremely hard times in the 1970s, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> announced the construction plans for a new downtown community college at a mill complex destroyed by fire two years ago and a $ 150,000 grant for a manufacturing research center to provide technical assistance to smaller manufacturing operations. The city has made a dramatic economic comeback and its former mills have been refurbished for a variety of business, housing and other projects. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> frequently refers to <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> and nearby <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, a city on his Tuesday agenda, as examples of how he has encouraged economic development in struggling areas. `` We can do for this country ... what we have done here,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told the luncheon, recalling his visist last week to struggling rural areas of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. `` They too want to have to have the same hope and optimism, the same vision of what's ahead, that you have created in <LOCATION> Lowell </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. Former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsongas </PERSON> told the gathering he hoped a visit to <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> by reporters covering the presidential campaign would put to rest Republican charges that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> overstates his role in the area's resurgence. `` We were getting irritated by those who say that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had nothing to do with the ` <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Mircale,''' <PERSON> Tsongas </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Syndicated columnist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> probably had been told he did not have to register a revolver he used to shoot a teen-ager trespassing in his yard, the city government's top lawyer says However, city officials on Monday refused to drop charges against <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, who has written in favor of gun control. He was charged with possession of an unregistered handgun and ammunition after wounding a youth who had been taking an unauthorized predawn swim in his backyard swimming pool June 14. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> has claimed that the weapon was given to him in 1982 by his son, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent. Both Rowans have steadfastly maintained that city officials instructed them that the gun did not have to be registered, since <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was a federal agent. That was buttressed by a memo written Aug. 11 from <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> Counsel <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to Police Chief <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, indicating that some police officers have erred in enforcing the gun registration law. `` It has come to my attention that some officers in the <ORGANIZATION> MPD </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- have interpreted the provision so as to exempt from registration firearms owned by <ORGANIZATION> MPD </ORGANIZATION> officers or other law enforcement officers,'' <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> in the memo, obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. `` I understand further that when an officer ceases to be an MPD or other law enforcement officer this ` exempt' status is not revoked and the former officer is not required to surrender the weapon.'' The city's far-reaching 1976 handgun ordinance, which requires that all weapons purchased after that date be registered with the city, should be amended to make clear that law enforcement officers are not exempt from this regulation, <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> concluded. `` Police were telling people that once they left any police force, they did n't have to register the weapon,'' said <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s attorney. `` The memo makes that clear.'' The document was included in material <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> submitted to <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in hopes of getting the charges dismissed. <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON>, said city officials still intend to prosecute the columnist. She would not comment on the memo, which she described as `` private, not something that should be in the public domain.'' Police also declined to comment. Efforts to reach <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> for comment were not immediately successsful. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s trial has been set for Sept. 22. If convicted of possessing an unregistered weapon and ammunition, he could receive up to one year in jail and a $ 1,000 fine on each count.

 A burglary suspect who was zapped by an electric fence and chased for a mile over hilly terrain covered in poison ivy was relieved when police arrived to arrest him, authorities said Monday. The suspect also had to jump off a 15-foot-high deck and was barked at by a neighbor's dogs, only to end up empty-handed and facing the man whose house he allegedly burglarized. `` Yes, he was glad to see police,'' <ORGANIZATION> Mendota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Delmont </PERSON> said Monday. The unidentified homeowner said he and his wife surprised the burglar when they returned to their home in this Twin Cities suburb Saturday. The suspect jumped off the deck and then climbed over a charged electric fence, taking a jolt. The suspect then headed through a neighbor's yard where four collies started barking. He dropped the purse he allegedly stol and kept running, the homeowner said. He then ran up an embankment the homeowner described as steep, rocky and laced with poison ivy. The homeowner said he finally caught up to the suspect, but both men were so tired they could only stare at each other. `` I said, ` Hey, <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON>, it's all over. Let's just wait for police,''' the homeowner said. `` Neither one of us had any energy left to hustle.'' Police arrived within minutes and arrested the suspect, Sgt. <PERSON> Dorance </PERSON> <PERSON> Wicks </PERSON> said. He is expected to be charged Tuesday.

<TEXT>
 The leaders of the Greek and Turkish communities in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> said Monday they will strive to achieve a settlement that would lead to the withdrawal of Turkish troops from their war-divided island. President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> leader, and <PERSON> Rauf </PERSON> <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON>, the president of the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state, arrived Monday at the invitation of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. At a meeting Wednesday, they are expected to discuss differences that have fueled tensions on the island since <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> invaded north <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> in 1974 in the wake of a coup by supporters of union with <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. It is the first time leaders of the divided nation have met in nearly three years. `` The <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> problem has lasted too long, 14 years of continuous occupation of a large part of our small island is too much, and it is high time it was settled,'' <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> told reporters. `` The withrawal of the Turkish troops is the key problem.'' `` I want a settlement very badly,'' <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> told reporters earlier. <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> is president of the <LOCATION> Turkish-Cypriot </LOCATION> Federated State of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, established in 1983 and recognized only by <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. He said the estimated 35,000 Turkish troops would begin withdrawing from <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> only `` after the formation of a transitional government and after the Turkish Cypriot community begins feeling it does not need the guarantee of their continuing presence for its safety.'' The main obstacles to a settlement have been <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> demands for the withdrawal of the Turkish troops and 45,000 Turks who have settled in north <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, as well as the repatriation of 200,000 Greek Cypriot refugees, one third of the island's population `` I am going into these negotiations with cautious optimism ... I know it is not easy to find a solution and it is going to be a long process,'' <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> said. After the meeting Wednesday between the two leaders in the presence of <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, the talks will move to <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>, a businessman, entered politics for the first time in February, when he was elected president. He has declared his intention to settle the <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> problem within a year of his election. By contrast, <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> became a prominent Turkish Cypriot leader before the island gained its independence from British colonial rule in 1960. He has engaged in fruitless negotiations with other Greek Cypriot leaders since tensions began in the 1960s. `` This new leader, Mr. <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>, we are told, intends to establish a partnership through a bi-zonal federation with us and he has created a good reputation as a man of good intentions who really wants a settlement, that's why we are here,'' <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> told reporters: `` It would be nice if the Turkish troops could be withdrawn in a day, but that is impractical. What is important is for the troops to be withdrawn and that we arrive at an agreed solution.'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, who arrived Monday night, said he hoped the talks with the two leaders will produce a date for the resumption of the intercommunal talks `` and a climate of dialogue.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it has called for a ban on the film `` The Last Temptation of Christ'' in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, claiming its interpretation of the life of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> is `` horrifyingly vulgar.'' Archbishop <PERSON> Seraphim </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> leader in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, sent a letter to the government saying <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON>'s film would `` clash directly with the religious sensitivities of our people. `` The film attempts a horrifyingly vulgar representation of the person of the founder of the Christian faith,'' the letter said. In his appeal, <PERSON> Seraphim </PERSON> cited the Greek Constitution, which enshrines Orthodox Christianity as the country's official religion. Church spokesman <PERSON> Yiannis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadzifoti </PERSON> said the letter was sent to Education Minister <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> and Minister to the Premier's Office <PERSON> Akis </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsochatzopoulos </PERSON> `` just a few days ago,'' but so far there had been no official response In the movie's most controversial scene, the crucified <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> imagines making love to <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdalene </PERSON>. <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON> has said it should n't offend audiences when taken `` in context'' as <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s last temptation _ to get married and lead a normal human life Scorsese's film is based on a novel by Greek author <PERSON> Nikos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazantzakis </PERSON>, who was threatened with excommunication by the <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> when the book came out in 1954. `` The Last Temptation'' is one of <PERSON> Kazantzakis </PERSON>' most popular books and it is still a big seller in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A fire at a basement social club that killed seven people in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> was not arson as originally suspected, fire officials said Monday. `` We believe at this point that the fire was accidental, but many important witnesses who were badly injured have yet to be interviewed by fire marshals,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON>. Arson had been suspected because of the rapid spread of the Sunday fire. Dozens of injured patrons, many severely burned, remain at eight hospitals. Eighteen firefighters also were injured, none seriously. The club, known as The Cave or The Hole, has been raided by police five times since March, and there have been nine arrests, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, a spokesman for Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. `` And the people have been let go on violations, which is not a misdemeanor. Two misdemeanors -LRB- within a year -RRB- allows the police commissioner to close the place under the padlock law.'' In a raid, police confiscate liquor and money, kick everyone out and arrest the employees, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. `` Once in a while they arrest the patrons.'' The club in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> does not have a liquor license, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. Most social clubs operate like bottle clubs in other states, where customers bring their own liquor and get mixers from the management. The club was a 50-by-75 foot T-shaped space partitioned into several rooms, with a bar at either side of the front entrance and a disc jockey's stand at the rear. Just past the bars were several tables and an area set aside for dancing. Patrons passed through a narrow doorway between a realty office and a store. Neighborhood residents said the entrance was always blocked by a shopkeeper's steel gate. A steel cellar door on the side street was locked. <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON> described the steep, narrow staircase that led down to the club as `` no better than a ladder.''

<HEAD>Tough Robots To Serve Prison Inmates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rolling robots bearing meals, laundry and mail will become servants to thousands of inmates at <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s new jail when it opens next year. Called the `` smart cart'' by county engineers, the boxy, self-propelled metal delivery machine is expected to head off mealtime violence by taking food to prisoners in the 15 buildings instead of the prisoners going to the food. `` The jail layout is such that the sheriff wants to deliver the food instead of taking inmates to a central dining area,'' said <PERSON> Ruel </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, assistant planner of the new facility. The board of supervisors of the county east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> has approved a $ 4.8 million contract for 18 robots made by <ORGANIZATION> Apogee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Collins </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, a company that already manufactures similar machines for several defense corporations. The robots, formally known as the automatic-guided vehicle system, stand 17 inches high, two feet wide and six feet long. Each carries about 30 food trays. At the new jail in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rita </LOCATION>, the $ 250,000 machine, which looks like a squat filing cabinet, will be dispatched from a central area and, guided by two miles of wire embedded in the jail's floor, will deliver meals to the separate 96-cell housing facilities. They are equipped with sensors which see 12 feet ahead, watching for obstacles. <PERSON> Alameda </PERSON> is the first jail system in the nation to install the robots, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, president of the manufacturer. The company has produced similar robots used by <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to deliver supplies, he said. `` It had to be designed so that -LRB- prisoners -RRB- ca n't hide contraband in it,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` We wo n't have a problem with it, unless the staff does n't do regular preventative maintenance checks.'' Sheriff's representatives say they are sure the machines will improve security. There will be no long walks to the kitchen or rowdy mealtime crowds, thanks to the 1,500-pound, stainless-steel robot. The <ORGANIZATION> Alameda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> plans to find out how tough the machines really are with a test patterned after a television luggage commercial. A retired sheriff's captain _ armed with confiscated `` implements of destruction,'' including an axe handle and ice pick _ will attempt to rough up one of the robots, said <PERSON> Ruel </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> assistant project planner for the jail. `` I'm not sure what he weighs, but he's a big man,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Wheat Supply May Recover In 1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If farmers boost plantings and the drought eases, this year's massive drain on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat stockpile could be brought under control in 1989, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. Total wheat supplies in the 1988-89 marketing year that began on June 1 are estimated at about 3.1 billion bushels, down more than 20 percent from last season and the lowest in almost a decade, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said in an outlook report. More than 22 million acres of wheat land were idled under the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s acreage program this year when farmers were required to set-aside 27.5 percent of their base acres. For 1989, they have to idle only 10 percent. `` With increased area and average yields in 1989-90, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be able to produce 2.5 billion bushels of wheat, enough to cover likely use without a further stock decline,'' the report said. Although the supply _ this year's harvest plus excess left over from previous crops _ will be more than enough to meet expected use, the wheat inventory by next June 1 is expected to be down to around 597 million bushels, down from 1.266 billion bushels this June 1. Based on the current rate of wheat use for domestic consumption and exports, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat supply next June 1 would represent an 87-day supply, compared with reserves for 185 days this June 1. It also would be the smallest since 1973-74. This year's wheat harvest of 1.82 billion bushels is far short of the more than 2.5 billion bushels needed to cover expected domestic and export demands in 1988-89. The shortfall of 684 million bushels has to come out of reserves. Thus, according to the report, the beginning inventory of 1.266 billion bushels is drawn down by the shortfall to 582 million bushels. When imports of 15 million bushels are added, the projected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat stockpile next June 1 becomes 597 million bushels.

<HEAD>Pentagon Seeking Money For Airplane `Recognition' System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> has asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to restore government financing for research on advanced airplane `` recognition'' systems of a type that might have prevented the shootdown of an Iranian airliner by a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> cruiser. Such systems, if proven feasible, could make it easier for radar centers on the ground or at sea to identify the types of planes they detect _ for example, distinguishing between a jet fighter and a cargo plane. The funding request was presented formally by <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, the assistant defense secretary for command, control, communications and intelligence systems, just two weeks after the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincennes </ORGANIZATION> on July 3 shot down an Iranian A-300 Airbus carrying 290 people that the cruiser mistook for a F-14 fighter jet. In a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations committees, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to restore $ 9.2 million for research and development of so-called `` non-cooperative target-recognition systems.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had cut the money from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s fiscal 1989 budget bill after discovering the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> were not prepared to commit themselves to continuing the research in fiscal 1990 and beyond. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> says it made a decision to scrap a five-year research program in the field because of the overall Pentagon budget squeeze. `` It is requested that consideration be given to a floor amendment to restore the requested $ 9.2 million in <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> funding for non-cooperative identification efforts,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> wrote on July 18. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> made no reference to the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> incident, but added: `` The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> is striving to develop aircraft identification systems to provide effective control of our increasingly lethal air defense weapons. This is not an easy problem; however, there is a non-cooperative identification technique which has the potential to identify hostile and civil aircraft.'' Non-cooperative identification is military slang for any system that does n't rely on aircraft radio emissions to make an identification. So-called cooperative systems, now in use by most air forces, involve one plane determining whether another is friendly by `` asking'' for a special radio transmission. The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, in mistakenly classifying the Iranian airliner as a hostile jet fighter, apparently made a mistake in the way it interpreted that plane's radio signal response. A non-cooperative system attempts to identify an airplane without asking for a radio transmission. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, in his letter, did not include any details of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> research because he said the work was classified. But he did say a new non-cooperative system `` has been tested on one ship with very good results.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> already has responded to <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s plea by agreeing to provide the research money. The House has yet to act, however, and the prospects for restoring the money still are uncertain.

<HEAD>IRA Bomb Kills Man Believed to be Navy Officer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> blew up a car Monday in east <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, killing a man police believe was a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officer only three days after eight British soldiers were slain by another bomb. Police said the victim, thought to be a 45-year-old recruiting officer, was the only casualty when the bomb exploded and the car burst into flames Monday afternoon during rush hour, just east of the downtown district. The outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which has focused its campaign of violence on the British security forces, claimed responsibility in a telephone call to a <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> radio station. The bomb exploded as the victim drove his gray <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capri </ORGANIZATION> over the <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>. Freelance photographer <PERSON> Crispin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodwell </PERSON> said he was 50 yards behind as the car pulled away from traffic lights. `` As it went to move off, it disappeared in a ball of fire,'' <PERSON> Rodwell </PERSON> said. `` It was immediately underneath a flyover -LRB- overpass -RRB- and the debris ricocheted off the underneath of the flyover. `` Some other cars stopped and some guys jumped out with fire extinguishers. They tried to put out the fire but they could not get anywhere near. They were beaten back by the flames. It was just a fireball.'' Three people were treated for shock at a nearby hospital. `` There was a woman in a silver -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- which veered off the road and hit one of the flyover supports,'' <PERSON> Rodwell </PERSON> said. `` I think she was OK but she was taken away very shocked.'' In the telephone call, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said it had carried out `` the execution of a British soldier.'' The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to drive the British from Protestant-dominated <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the province with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, which is 95 percent Roman Catholic. Eight soldiers were killed and 27 wounded early Saturday when an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bomb wrecked an unmarked military bus carrying members of the First Battalion of the Light Infantry from <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> airport to their barracks at <LOCATION> Omagh </LOCATION>, 50 miles west. All the dead were in their late teens and 20s and had been on furlough in mainland <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said Monday that detention without trial of people suspected of guerrilla activity had not been ruled out. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Maginnis </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> who urged Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> to reinstate the policy, said he gave her the names of three <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> men he claimed were involved in the Saturday bombing. A letter bomb was sent to <PERSON> Maginnis </PERSON> last week, but was defused. He claimed internment of 50-70 `` top flight'' <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> organizers would `` drastically reduce'' violence in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> ordered a security review after the bombing Saturday, which was the deadliest <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> attack on the military since 1982. The attack brought to 26 the number of soldiers killed in this summer's <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> blitz on British military targets in the province, mainland <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and continental <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` You do not tell your enemy precisely what it is you are going to do, ever,'' the prime minister told reporters who had asked what security measures the government could introduce to protect the soldiers. `` We must never let the terrorists win.'' Northern Ireland Secretary <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, the Cabinet member responsible for the province, promised a relentless campaign against `` the men of evil.'' Government sources indicated Sunday that Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and King had decide against demands that known guerrillas be picked up, on grounds the detentions would be a propaganda coup for the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. Then Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>, a Conservative, introduced internment in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> on Aug. 9, 1971. About 2,000 people were held without trial before Prime Minister <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> abandoned it in December 1975 amid world criticism.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on Monday accused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of redeploying its troops along the central border region in violation of the 3-day-old cease-fire in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Iranian troops on Saturday and Sunday moved closer to <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> positions on the central front as well as moving troops to other, unspecified `` new areas.'' The dispatch said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> complained to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> observers in the area, warning that unless the Iranians pulled back, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> would `` forcibly return them'' to their previous positions. `` The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team intervened and asked the Iranian side to withdraw, and the Iranian troops actually started withdrawal'' late Monday, the dispatch said. The state-run agency did not identify the area beyond saying it was on the central front, and gave no further details in its three-sentence dispatch. There was no immediate response to the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> claim from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> or from the peacekeeping force. At the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official refused to discuss the alleged cease-fire violations but said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> truce observers were defusing tensions successfully on the front line. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Nadia </PERSON> <PERSON> Younes </PERSON> also declined comment on reports from shipping sources in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> that <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> patrol boats had been seen cruising the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> in the southern gulf and the <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Arab </PERSON> waterway separating <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>'s report to the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> calling for the establishment of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Iraq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> requested a naval patrol for `` certain sensitive areas in or near the Shatt <PERSON> al-Arab </PERSON>.'' Ms. <PERSON> Younes </PERSON> declined to discuss whether the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, 525 miles southeast of the <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Arab </PERSON> at the opposite end of the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, could be considered `` near'' that waterway. Both areas have been flashpoints in the nearly 8-year-old war. The conflict broke out in the <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Arab </PERSON> in September 1980 when <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Manama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, a Kuwait-flagged cargo vessel, one of 93 vessels trapped in Iraqi waters since the war began, became the first to reach its homeport Monday after the cease-fire. The owners, the Kuwait-based <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said the <PERSON> Ibn </PERSON> <PERSON> Haithem </PERSON> reached the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Shuweikh </LOCATION>. According to <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>'s Register of Ships, there were nine vessels trapped at <PERSON> Khor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zubair </PERSON>, nine at the adjacent Umm Al-Qasr water inlet, and 75 in the Shatt <PERSON> Al-Arab </PERSON> estuary separating <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Iran-Iraq peace talks being overseen by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> are set to begin Thursday in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, following a cease-fire that was implemented Saturday as a first step in ending a conflict that has claimed about 1 million lives. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> began observing the cease-fire Saturday morning, but have not given up swapping accusations and counter-charges. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said an Iranian sniper killed an <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> soldier Saturday, and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed Iraqi troops fired shots near a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer team in the central region of the war front on Saturday. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general's office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> released a letter from <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> on Monday stating that if the Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> attempts to search <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> ships for war material, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> `` will resist it by such means as it deems appropriate.'' <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> said such searches would violate the cease-fire provisions of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Security Council Resolution 598, which called for the cease-fire, troop withdrawal, exchange of prisoners, peace talks and establishment of an impartial commission to decide who was responsible for the conflict. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> told an airport news conference in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on Monday that a peace settlement will require long and tedious talks, but `` if there is a political will the rhythm could be quite rapid.'' He said he may later name a deputy to lead the negotiations. Asked when he expected a comprehensive settlement, he said this was a `` $ 100,000 question.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief said a major question in the talks' initial phase was repatriating the `` more than 80,000'' prisoners of war. He said he expects `` great cooperation from both sides'' on the POW issue, and that he was pleased with the cooperation <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military observers received from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in monitoring the cease-fire.

 Paramilitary police beat and kicked about 30 people and arrested more than 100 others during protests marking the 20th anniversary of the Soviet-led invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, dissidents said Monday. Dissident journalist <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> demanded a government investigation of the `` numerous crimes'' committed during protests Sunday and an explanation of what dissidents said was a new police unit created to break up demonstrations. The arrests came during rallies marking the Soviets' 1968 move into <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> to stop the liberal reforms of the `` Prague Spring.'' Protesters who were arrested were brought into a closed courtroom Monday and most received jail sentences of 10 to 15 days and fines of up to $ 320, the dissidents said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official Soviet news agency, provided details in a rare report on court proceedings and carried police accusations that protesters acted illegally. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said 96 people were arrested. But members of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, a new group calling itself an alternative to the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, claimed as many as 150 people were arrested. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview that dozens of people remained in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> jails Monday night, awaiting court appearances. `` We demand the creation of an investigatory group of the Procurator of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> for a full investigation of the numerous crimes committed by the so-called law enforcement organs on Aug. 21, 1988,'' <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>, editor of the dissident journal Glasnost, said at a news conference in his <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> apartment. About 500 demonstrators took part in an initial protest in <LOCATION> Pushkin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, chanting `` <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>,'' when they were prevented from holding up banners. About 500 paramilitary officers and police charged and dispersed them. About 100 people took part in a later protest, which also was broken up, dissidents said. <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> was detained outside a police station and said he saw several demonstrators being beaten. Dissidents said about 30 people were kicked or beaten. <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> said <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Babitsky </PERSON>, an editor of Glasnost, received a concussion from a beating in a police bus, and that an ambulance was called twice Sunday evening to the police station to treat him. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Myrikov </PERSON>, deputy head of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, harshly criticized the rally organizers. `` The organizers of the rally shouted provocative slogans, carried posters whose contents were an insult to the dignity of Soviet people, spread slanderous leaflets, and instigated those present to illegal actions,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> report quoted <PERSON> Myrikov </PERSON> as saying. <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> said demonstrators were beaten by about 10 members of what he described as a new force formed to break up protests. Members of the squad wore khaki clothing without insignia, heavy black boots, and berets with markings of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> said. A woman who was at one of the demonstrations, <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Savankova </PERSON>, said she was told by a policeman at the scene that the force was specially trained to break up demonstrations. The crackdown was in keeping with the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s steadfast defense of the Soviet-led invasion by <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> forces on Aug. 20-21 in 1968, although some Soviets have suggested the `` Prague Spring'' reforms crushed in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> resemble those now being tried in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

 The commander of the next space shuttle mission said Monday the nation's manned space program could not survive another tragedy like Challenger and predicted it would not happen on his flight. `` I have great confidence in the machine; we feel it is a much safer machine,'' <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> told the final news conference he and his crew will hold before their launching, scheduled for late September or early October. `` We clearly could not afford to lose another vehicle, much less another crew,'' <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think the manned spaceflight program could withstand another Challenger on STS-26 -LRB- <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>'s flight -RRB- `` That's high stakes, but I'm not concerned that that's going to happen. In the last year and a half, I've seen how we've modified the machine and how we've done business. So I feel very comfortable with the flight.'' <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> will command Discovery on the first shuttle mission since Challenger exploded 73 seconds after launch on Jan. 28, 1986, killing the crew of seven. His crewmates will be <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Covey </PERSON>, the pilot, and mission specialists <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lounge </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilmers </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel. <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has been hesitant to set a new date for the often-postponed launch because engineers are still troubleshooting two problems that developed during a test firing of Discovery's engines on the launch pad at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> on Aug. 10 One is a small leak of hydrogen gas detected in an area where the orbiter is joined to the external fuel tank. The other is the apparent sluggishness of three gaseous oxygen valves in the fueling system. `` There are some concerns about both of these,'' he said. `` We have to understand these better.'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials said earlier they did not think the problems were serious, that they were testing both systems and that they hoped to be able to announce resolutions and a launch date later this week. <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> said the Discovery mission `` is very important to the nation and to the space agency in getting back to flying.'' Lounge said he realized `` this is an important flight and our country will be looking at us, but I do n't feel any pressure because of it.'' <PERSON> Covey </PERSON> reported the four-day flight will be less complicated than most previous shuttle missions because <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has elected to take a conservative approach on this first post-Challenger mission. `` We're not breaking any new ground,'' he said. But <PERSON> Covey </PERSON> said because of 210 modifications made to the orbiter, the crew in essence will be making a shakedown flight of a new spacecraft. `` We will have time to concentrate on those changes,'' he said. The astronauts' main goal is to deploy a communications satellite. They also will conduct 11 science and technology experiments. The Challenger disaster was blamed on a faulty joint in one of the shuttle's two solid fuel booster rockets. The rocket has undergone more than 50 modifications. <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> said he is confident the rockets will work but `` the first two minutes of flight will be the most tense because the solids are converting so much kinetic energy. Once the solids have burned out and fallen away and we're in smooth main-engine flight, my pulse rate will drop,'' he said. <PERSON> Hilmers </PERSON> said at launch time the crew's thoughts will be with the Challenger astronauts. `` We'll be thinking of them, but our thoughts will be more on the future than on the past,'' he said. `` The Challenger tragedy was a great tragedy for the nation and a tragedy for each of us. We ca n't dwell on it because if we do we might repeat the mistakes of the past.'' <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> was asked if his crew was taking along any momentoes or was planning any ceremony in space for the Challenger astronauts. `` On the day when we have our press conference from space, we will share them with you,'' he replied. The press conference is scheduled during the third day of the mission.

<TEXT>
 Playboy will publish `` new comments'' from a former female lobbyist about a vacation during which she shared a cottage with vice-presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and two other congressmen, the magazine's managing editor said Monday. <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>'s remarks about events at the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> cottage eight years ago will appear in the text accompanying a `` Women of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'' pictorial in the November issue, said <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> Managing Editor <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>. <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> will appear nude in the pictorial, he said. Black declined to reveal what <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> said. `` The article originally was written well in advance -LRB- of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s selection by the GOP -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Black </PERSON>. `` She was mentioned in the story, but we had no plans to run her picture. `` After <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was picked, we got back in touch with her, did some additional work, and inserted the new material three days ago.'' Black declined to answer further questions about the article or its contents. The magazine is scheduled to be on the newsstands Oct. 1. Parkinson first appeared nude in the magazine in 1980, several months after being identified as the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lobbyist who shared a cottage with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and two other Republican congressmen, former Reps. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Railsback </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> said she had an affair with <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, who later left the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, now the junior senator from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, has said he did not have an affair with <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has never been accused of intimacy with the former lobbyist. A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation of <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>'s relationships with members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> found no impropriety. `` She did n't sleep with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>,'' said society columnist <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxa </PERSON>, a longtime confidant of Parkinson who was acting as an informal spokesman for her last week. Questions about the incident were revived last week when <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> named <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as his GOP running mate. `` That's been looked into and there's absolutely nothing to it,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> when the issue resurfaced. At the time of the incident, <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> was 30 years old and a lobbyist for an insurance industry group that opposed legislation to set up a national crop insurance program. The bill passed in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> by a 235-150 vote in September 1980, but <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> voted against it. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigated Parkinson's activities in connection with allegations of a sex-and-influence scandal but dropped its case in August 1981 without filing criminal charges. Playboy's managing photo editor, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, said Sunday night he thinks the picture of Parkinson posing nude was taken in the early'80s.

<TEXT>
 The original, uncut version of <PERSON> Upton </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>'s novel `` The Jungle'' will be published in October, eight decades after the original shocked the nation with its expose of squalid conditions in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> stockyards <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> cut his original manuscript by a third for the 1906 Doubleday, Page edition to make the book more marketable, according to <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> DeGruson </PERSON>, a professor and curator of rare books at <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. <PERSON> DeGruson </PERSON> said he pieced together the original novel from a truckload of rotting paper given to him in 1980 by a young man who had been hired to clean out the cellar of a farmhouse in <LOCATION> Girard </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kan </PERSON>. The man recognized <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>'s name on the business records, memos, correspondence and other material and brought the boxes to the university library instead of the dump. `` The Jungle'' had been serialized for seven months in The Appeal to Reason, published in <PERSON> Girard </PERSON>. It was the largest-circulation weekly newspaper in the country and the flagship paper of the Socialist movement in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The house where the material was found apparently belonged to a friend of the managing editor of The Appeal. When <PERSON> Doubleday </PERSON> published the book it caused meat sales to slump and spurred President <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> to order an investigation that led to the nation's first Pure Food and Drug Act. Considering the material that was expunged, `` it's amazing that the published book had any impact whatsoever,'' <PERSON> DeGruson </PERSON> said. `` Revision was drastic,'' <PERSON> DeGruson </PERSON> wrote in the introduction to the new edition, due in October from <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lukes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> changed the ending to make it more upbeat and added a love story, among other revisions, he said Most of the deletions pertained to the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> joined in 1902, but he also omitted passages criticizing the press, big business and marriage. <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> was the author of more than 90 books, including `` The Dragon's Teeth,'' which won him a Pulitzer Prize in 1942. He died in 1968 at age 90.

 <LOCATION> JERUSALEM </LOCATION> _ The number of Palestinians traveling to jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from the occupied lands has declined by nearly 20 percent in the 8-month-old uprising, and workers say fear of attack by Jewish extremists is a major reason. The loss of manpower has caused serious problems in construction and agriculture, which are dependent on cheap Arab labor. Only about 85,000 of the 105,000 Palestinians who worked in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> before the rebellion began last Dec. 8 still hold those jobs, said <PERSON> Arie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pikel </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. He said most Arabs who had stopped working in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> were unskilled day-laborers who were not registered with authorities and received no social benefits. Israeli employers want to replace the Palestinians with imported labor. The initial response was negative, but <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Katzav </PERSON> has begun approving such requests. Many Palestinians quit their jobs because of pressure from leaders of the uprising and gangs of masked youths who enforce the leadership orders. Buses taking Palestinian workers to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> are stoned and workers who defy orders to strike are threatened. Recently, increasing anti-Palestinian violence inside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has added a new dimension to the problem. Last Saturday, a Palestinian guarding a construction site in downtown <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> told police a gang of seven Israelis beat him unconscious. A shack was set on fire on a construction site in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Or </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yehuda </LOCATION> suburb two weeks ago, killing three sleeping workers from the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The attack inspired riots in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and the army imposed a three-day curfew. Police arrested two Israeli suspects and said Monday investigators found the fire to be criminal and not related to the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> political conflict. Many Palestinians say the increasing tensions keep them closer to home. <PERSON> Fadel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Qik </PERSON>, 21, of the Arub refugee camp near <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, opened a photography studio after leaving a job as a watchman in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that paid the equivalent of $ 360 a month. `` Even if I make only $ 180 a month, it's better to work in the refugee camp than in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' <LOCATION> Qik </LOCATION> said. <LOCATION> Qik </LOCATION>'s 50-year-old father, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, and his brothers, <PERSON> Zakariyeh </PERSON>, 17, and <PERSON> Nabil </PERSON>, 16, also have stopped working in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and are unemployed. According to residents, about half the 2,000 Palestinians from <ORGANIZATION> Arub </ORGANIZATION> once employed in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> no longer work there. Some raise chickens to survive the hard times, and a few operations have become commercial with up to 1,500 fowl. <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fatah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamis </PERSON>, 22, said he used to sleep in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> rather than make the 35-mile trip home to <LOCATION> Arub </LOCATION>, but has gone home each night since the Or <PERSON> Yehuda </PERSON> fire. <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Amnon </PERSON> <PERSON> Linn </PERSON>, an Arab affairs expert in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said Jewish violence against <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> was not widespread. He called it the work of `` marginal groups on on the fringes of Israeli society.''

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> denied allegations Monday from a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman that the Democratic presidential nominee used college deferments to avoid combat in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, saying `` I served my country proudly.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> attended <ORGANIZATION> Swarthmore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> from 1951-55, asking for and receiving deferments in 1952, 1953 and 1954. He said he went to his draft board with several weeks of school left and asked to be drafted immediately. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> served in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> for just under two years, including 16 months as part of a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> contingent assigned to the demilitarized zone in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.

He was discharged in 1957 and attended <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> upon his return. `` I was anxious to do my military service,'' he said.

But he avoided combat by using his education deferments. There's nothing wrong with what he did because it was allowed. `` The point is the press has made a big thing out of <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> joining the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. -LRB- But -RRB- <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> stood a chance of being sent into combat,'' while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did n't, <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said. `` We really ought to be putting this aside and get on with the seriousness of the campaign.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> wants to make sure this summer's drought does n't claim another victim along with parched crops: the company's reputation. Stung by criticism that it backed away from drought insurance and left thousands of farmers high and doubly dry, the Warren-based company has set up a crisis center, mobilized phone-answering troops for toll-free numbers and taken out newspaper ads. `` They're meeting this like meeting a -LRB- natural -RRB- catastrophe _ you set up a crisis center,'' said <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, who follows the company for the investment bank <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` I think the company has done the best they can,'' she said Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> has said applications for the insurance far exceeded the original $ 30 million in coverage it had authorized. In response to the demand, the company later increased the authorized amount to $ 40 million. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> has paid about $ 20 million to farmers who applied for the coverage before the June 15 deadline but after the coverage limit had been reached. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> is the nation's 16th largest property and casualty insurer, with a net worth of $ 2.1 billion as of June 30. Management appointed a senior underwriting officer, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Vangilder </PERSON>, to handle the company's response to the complaints, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Korkuch </PERSON>, who said she has spent a `` substantial amount of time on this question'' in the past two months. The efforts are aimed at repairing `` the damage that may have been done to our reputation and really get back on track,'' she said. But to <PERSON> Davenport </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, attorney <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giebelstein </PERSON>, who has sued <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> on behalf of 2,000 <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> farmers, the campaign `` does n't address the fundamental issues: The entitlement of the farmers to the policies. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> says that despite its authorization for only $ 30 million in insurance, agents offered an estimated $ 400 million to nearly 9,000 farmers in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. The policies specify that <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> had to approve the applications before they were accepted, the company said. Only 1,160 were approved, said Ms. <PERSON> Korkuch </PERSON>. Farmers across the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> have sued, and a federal judge in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> recently granted class-action status to one suit. The others probaby will be consolidated there, said <PERSON> Giebelstein </PERSON>. State insurance regulators also are examining the company. But all may be sound and fury signifying nothing, depending on the weather. Because the policies are pinned strictly to the cumulative amount of rain for a given area from June to Aug. 31, rain before the deadline could render the matter moot. Already enough rain has fallen recently to relieve the company of its obligation for about half the $ 40 million in coverage already granted, said <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Devlin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION>'s senior vice president for finance. `` We'll just have to wait until Aug. 31 and see how it shakes out,'' <PERSON> Giebelstein </PERSON> said when asked whether he would continue the legal action despite the rain. `` If it rains enough, it's hard to complain.''

 Albanian leader <PERSON> Ramiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Alia </PERSON> said in a speech reported Monday that <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is producing `` sinister propaganda'' in an attempt to blame its ethnic discord on <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>. In a speech Sunday to a rally in <LOCATION> Peshkopia </LOCATION> near the Yugoslav border, <PERSON> Alia </PERSON> denounced criticism of ethnic Albanians who live in the adjacent <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> province of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, the official Albanian news agency <ORGANIZATION> ATA </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. Ethnic Albanians make up nearly 90 percent of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s population. <PERSON> Alia </PERSON> said the alleged <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> campaign has `` taken aim even at those few rights'' recognized in the Yugoslav constitution. `` The difficult problems <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is undergoing now are not solved and can not be solved at the expense of the Albanians,'' <PERSON> Alia </PERSON> said. Serbs and Montenegrins in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> claim they are harassed by ethnic Albanians. At least 30,000 held a rally Saturday in <LOCATION> Titograd </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION> near the Albanian border, to protest such harassment. More than 30,000 people have left <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> since bloody riots in 1981, when some ethnic Albanians demanded greater autonomy. Official figures say most of those who left were Serbs and Montenegrins who claimed discrimination by the Albanians.

<TEXT>
 Mayor <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON> disclosed Monday that the city faces a $ 19 million budget deficit this year and said officials kept the shortfall secret to avoid negative publicity during the Republican convention. The mayor proposed a two-year `` property service charge'' designed to raise $ 10 million to help bridge the gap. Voters have turned down two revenue raising proposals since <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON> took office in 1986, but the mayor said he hopes a wave of good feeling that swept the city during the GOP national convention would generate support for his proposal. `` This last week was a spectacular week,'' said the mayor. `` I think people felt a sense of pride in the city.'' If the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> approves the idea, a proposal for a flat $ 125 fee on properties would be put on the November ballot. If approved, the city would collect this year's fee in December. Spending cuts and other adjustments also would be needed to balance the city's $ 280 million budget, said <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Steiner </PERSON>, the mayor's chief administrative officer. <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON> said city officials realized in July there would be a shortfall after the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> _ facing its own fiscal crisis _ cut funding for the city by $ 7.5 million. City tax collections also are coming in below budget, officials said. But officials kept a lid on the news, <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON> said, so as not to offset the good publicity the city was getting during last week's convention. `` I think the positive press that we would have gotten would have been countered by the ` City in Crisis' or the ` City Faces a Deficit,''' <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON>, a Democrat, has been dealing with financial problems since taking office. In 1986, he wiped out an impending $ 30 million deficit by laying off workers, putting city employees on a four-day work week and shutting down <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> one day a week.

 Prosecutors asked Monday that a brother of former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> be sentenced to 15 years in prison and fined $ 5.84 million on charges of embezzling public funds, taking bribes and peddling influence. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyung-hwan </PERSON>, 46, is accused of taking 7.6 billion won -LRB- $ 10.5 million -RRB- in embezzlement, extortion and bribes while head of the <ORGANIZATION> Saemaul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, a semi-official community development project. At the closing session Monday, senior prosecutor <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Myung-jae </PERSON> said the younger <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> deserved a heavy penalty for amassing an illegal fortune by using Saemaul projects as cover. The Saemaul Movement, once heavily subsidized by <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>'s government, oversaw development projects in both urban and rural areas. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said the defendant showed no remorse and refused to admit most of the alleged wrongdoing despite the evidence and testimony from witnesses. He was arrested soon after his brother left the presidency in February at the end of a seven-year term. Court officials said a verdict and sentencing in the case are expected Sept. 5. It was the first prosecution of a corruption case arising from the Chun administration. But the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, in which the government party has lost its majority, has set up a special committee to investigate alleged irregularities involving the former president and his family. The prosecution also demanded prison terms ranging from one to seven years for 11 other defendants, most of them former Saemaul officials, who are charged with embezzlement, breach of trust, tax evasion and other offenses. In his final statement to the court, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyung-hwan </PERSON> asked for leniency because of his efforts on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> Saemaul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> said Monday a drop in the <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> water level would diminish flooding in three days but the critical time lies ahead: early September, when the rainy season peaks. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> said foreign news media had exaggerated the effects of the floods. His comments were carried by <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in a dispatch from <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nile </ORGANIZATION>'s level at <LOCATION> Dima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, about 530 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, fell by four inches Monday and would be followed by a drop in the water level in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. `` This means that, however heavy the flood is today and tomorrow, it will diminish in three days,'' the agency quoted him as saying. `` The time to be reassured about the Nile flood is the first week of September.'' Torrential rains Aug. 4-5 caused flooding in northern, eastern and central <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> that killed more than 90 people, destroyed at least 150,000 dwellings and left 1.5 million people homeless _ more than a third of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>'s nearly 4 million inhabitants. Health officials predict epidemics of water-borne diseases as people cut off from drinking water supplies are forced to drink from standing pools. Thousands of people already have developed diarrhea. Malaria and typhoid are on the rise and cholera is an imminent risk. The last flood of similar magnitude was in 1946, but <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> said his country was coping better this time. He said foreign news reports potrayed `` a drowning <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, with spreading plagues and the first threat of locusts in a thousand years.'' He acknowledged, however, that swarms of locusts are expected to invade <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> from neighboring <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> and will threaten five million acres of cultivated land. He said the government had 22 airplanes ready to spray affected areas and enough insecticides for 15 days. `` <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> will fight the danger, with assistance from friends,'' he said.

 <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> opened their files to the <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wiesenthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> to help track down pro-Nazi war criminals now living in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the center's Canadian representative said Monday. Sol <PERSON> Littman </PERSON>, who spent several weeks this summer in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, said he has forwarded 44 names to the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s war crimes unit and the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He said the names would not be released publicly until <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian authorities had time to investigate the allegations. <PERSON> Littman </PERSON> said the lists include 16 suspected members of the Romanian Iron Guard who are thought to be living in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and elsewhere in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and seven believed to be in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Another 21 people are suspected of being Lithuanian police militiamen iving in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Littman </PERSON>. He said all the suspects are wanted in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for war crimes, including the murders of Jews and other civilians. <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, a Baltic republic, was taken over by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> during World War II. The Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weisenthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> is dedicated to tracking down Nazi war criminals who have evaded arrest and help bringing them to trial. <PERSON> Littman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s leading Nazi hunter, said the files showed many Iron Guard members were imprisoned after participating in revolts in 1939 and 1941 in unsuccessful efforts to overthrow <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s conservative government headed by <PERSON> Ion </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonescu </PERSON>. He said Nazis stationed in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> during World War II helped them escape and many entered camps for displaced persons before making their way to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Wiesenthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> had reported in 1981 that some Iron Guard members were living in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> became a partner of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> during World War II and the <ORGANIZATION> Wiesenthal </ORGANIZATION> report said, `` Frustrated by the -LRB- Romanian -RRB- army, which remained loyal to <PERSON> Antonescu </PERSON>, the Iron Guard turned on <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s Jewish minority. `` In one of the cruelest pogroms in history, hundreds of Jews in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jassy </PERSON> were beaten to death on the streets, women and children mutilated, and the bodies of victims hung in abattoirs on meat hooks.'' Rabbi <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hier </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Wiesenthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said the former leader of the Iron Guard, who he identified as <PERSON> Horia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sima </PERSON>, is now living in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. `` These groups are still prevailing in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, continuing to preach the same fascist ideology and raising a second and third generation,'' <PERSON> Littman </PERSON> said. He accused the Canadian government of acting slowly in its investigation of suspected war criminals. The <ORGANIZATION> Wiesenthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> says <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> has acted against only two alleged war criminals since legislation was passed last year permitting trials of the suspects in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Former Hungarian police Capt. <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Finta </PERSON> is awaiting a preliminary hearing in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> on charges stemming from the deportation of Jews in 1944 and the government is trying to deport <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Luitjens </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, now an instructor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, who is accused of collaborating with the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>.

 A panel of bishops will be appointed to study the reports of miracles at a charismatic church where three parishioners claim to receive messages from the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>'s bishop has announced. About 12,000 people gathered on the grounds of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Neumann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> on Aug. 15 to celebrate the Feast of the Assumption, after the parishioners said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> told them miracles would occur on that day. During the Mass, hundreds reported seeing apparitions of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> in the clouds, while others claimed that the evening sun appeared to dance in the sky and that silver-colored rosaries turned a golden hue. `` I am asking the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> to assist me in preparing an investigation of the event and a panel of specialists will be appointed shortly for this task,'' <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> Bishop <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said in a statement issued late Friday afternoon. It was his first comment on the Mass since the apparitions were reported. <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>'s secretary said he declined to speak to reporters. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said the organization has no involvement in the investigation. `` He is free to set up his own investigation and ask experts in on his own, but the national organization has nothing to do with that,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipovsky </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said he also has talked with an official from the office of Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s envoy to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` An investigation of this kind is normal and the panel will be charged with studying the authenticity of the events,'' the statement said. The three parishioners say they began receiving messages from the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> earlier this summer, shortly after they returned from a pilgrimage to <LOCATION> Medugorje </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, where six youths claim they have seen apparitions of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> since 1981. Hundreds have begun attending Monday night rosary services in which <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Constancio </PERSON>, <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Slate </PERSON> read aloud messages they claimed to have received. The church has printed books containing these messages and more than 50,000 copies have been distributed. In his statement, <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said he has asked St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Neumann </PERSON> pastor Monsignor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> not to promote or print the books until the investigation is concluded. Calls to <PERSON> James </PERSON>' office Monday for comment were not immediately returned. <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said earlier that people should n't assume anything supernatural is happening at the church. `` I take a cautious attitude about the rosary messages spoken about by several parishioners at St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Neumann </PERSON>,'' he said in July. `` I neither encourage people to participate in the events nor do I discourage them.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Republican convention boosted <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to a narrow lead in the presidential race, although many voters harbor doubts about Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> as his running mate, a national poll said Monday. Half the respondents in the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> survey said they did not believe <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has the experience to be a good president, and another 28 percent were unsure. Thirty-nine percent said they wished <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chose someone else. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nonetheless led Democratic nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by 46 percent to 40 percent in the poll of 1,221 registered voters nationwide. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, enjoying his own convention bounce, had led by 17 points early this month. The survey was the first conducted entirely after the GOP convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> ended Thursday with a well-received speech by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. It found favorable views of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and confidence in his leadership well up from their pre-convention levels. But voters expressed reservations about the qualifications and background of the 41-year-old <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who has faced a barrage of questions about his enrollment in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> during the height of the Vietnam War. Forty-nine percent of the respondents said phone calls made on behalf of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to the guard represented `` an unfair attempt'' to gain his admission; 40 percent said such calls were acceptable and 21 percent were unsure. Among the seven in 10 who had heard of the issue, 48 percent said they believed <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had joined the guard to avoid the draft. Just 29 percent believed that was not his main reason, and 22 percent said they did n't know. Also among those who had heard about it, just 50 percent believed <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was telling the truth about the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> issue, while 26 percent said he was not and 24 percent did n't know. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also did not do well in comparison with the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee for vice president, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Forty-one percent said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> would be a better vice president, to 28 percent for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. The rest did n't know. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> received a mixed rating for his handling of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s selection Forty-seven percent rated it fair or poor, 44 percent said good or excellent. But twice as many said poor _ 18 percent _ as said excellent, 9 percent. Still, backing was up for the Republican ticket as a whole. The <ORGANIZATION> Bush-Quayle </ORGANIZATION> ticket led by 10 points among men and roughly tied among women, 44-42. It led by 18 points among the youngest voters, age 18-29; among the oldest, 64 and up, the race was a 41-41 tie. The six-point spread in the race was just within the poll's margin of error of plus or minus three points But several recent polls have shown <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gaining and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> dropping from his post-Democratic convention lead, allowing the conclusion that the Republicans lead slightly. In a Gallup poll this weekend they led by nine points, 51-42. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was expected to gain in popularity following the publicity from his convention, just as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did after the Democratic convention. Such bounces in the polls generally settle as the campaign progresses. On <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s personal ratings, 51 percent in the new poll said they had faith in his ability to deal wisely with an international crisis, while 37 percent would be uneasy. His rating on this question in a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll early this month was the precise opposite. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, meanwhile, did far worse on the confidence measure: 53 percent uneasy, 29 percent confident. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was rated favorably by 39 percent and unfavorably by 25 percent in the new survey, much improved from his favorable-unfavorable rating of 27-33 in the previous poll. Still, 27 percent were undecided in their opinion of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and 8 percent said they had not heard enough about him, after his nearly eight years as vice president. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who came in for sharp criticism at the Republican convention, saw his favorable-unfavorable rating drop from 38-19 before the GOP convention to 32-25 after it, with 29 percent undecided and 13 percent saying they had not heard enough. Efforts by the Republicans to paint <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a liberal had little effect; 34 percent saw him as a liberal, compared with 35 percent in the earlier poll. But 34 percent said it was more likely <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would raise taxes, up from 27 percent in early August. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was rated favorably by 21 percent and unfavorably by 12 percent; the rest had n't heard enough or were undecided. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> scored 24 percent favorable to 18 percent unfavorable. Forty-two percent said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> had enough experience to be president, 23 percent said not and 35 percent were n't sure. For <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, just 22 percent said he had enough experience, 50 percent said not and 28 percent were unsure. Asked if they were glad <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> picked <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, 33 percent said they were, 39 percent said they wished he chose someone else, 12 percent volunteered that it did n't matter and 16 percent did n't know. The poll was conducted Friday through Sunday.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is reducing the number of military air operations to be flown over the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, but has made no decision to remove warships from the area, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Monday. When a reporter said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had urged that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> withdraw its naval forces from the gulf in view of the new cease-fire between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> declined comment. But he added: `` We have said in the past that as the threat diminishes in the gulf, so would our presence. We are taking some actions at this time to allow certain activities that have been suspended in the past, primarily things like port calls, number of sorties flown off the carriers, a few of those kinds of things are being changed to reflect a more relaxed atmosphere following the cease-fire, but at this point there has been no decision to remove ships from the gulf.'' An administration official, speaking on condition he not be identified, said a decision was made over the weekend to fly fewer sorties and to make more port calls to allow sailors to rest, since there is less need to patrol. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said there had been no changes in the `` rules of engagement,'' the standing operational orders given <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military commanders. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. Col. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said that since the cease-fire went into effect, the situation in the gulf has stabilized and `` the number of operational requirements has been somewhat lessened.'' He said sorties flown off <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> aircraft carriers include both training exercises and missions to defend <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> units in the gulf against real or perceived threats. `` The number of flights, therefore, fluctuates from day to day and as the threat to our forces in the gulf decreases, the number of operational flights required would also diminish,'' <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said. He also said that while the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has a policy against discussing ship schedules in advance, `` if operational requirements for ships ... actively patrolling diminishes, we will arrange additional port calls for rest and recreation for the crews.''

 Gravediggers in northern <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> have counted the bodies of about 5,000 people massacred in battles between members of the <PERSON> Hutu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tutsi </PERSON> tribes, government officials said Monday. Government and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials in neighboring <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION> said at least 35,000 Burundians crossed the border into <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION> to escape the slaughter last week. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said no Americans were in the areas of the killings. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Cyprien </PERSON> <PERSON> Mbonimpa </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> included the first official death toll in an official communique issued at a morning briefing for diplomats. It also was read during the 1 p.m. newscast on government radio, according to diplomats who spoke in telephone interviews from <LOCATION> Bujumbura </LOCATION>, capital of the small, densely populated country in Central Africa. They asked that their names not be used. `` It said the people in charge of burying the bodies have counted approximately 5,000,'' a Western diplomat said, but whether that was the total dead was not unknown immediately. `` It appeared as if they had concluded their work, but it was not at all clear,'' he said. `` The facts are very, very unclear and sketchy because of the remoteness of the area.'' He said there appeared to have been no major violence since about 24 hours after the fighting began Aug. 14 between the Hutu, <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>'s majority tribe, and the <PERSON> Tutsi </PERSON>, the minority tribe that controls the military and government. Members of the Hutu and <PERSON> Tutsi </PERSON> tribes are old enemies. After a coup attempt in 1972 in the former <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> colony, the Tutsi massacred 100,000-300 ,000 Hutu, including most of the tribe's intelligentsia, according to human rights `` The news did n't start coming down to <LOCATION> Bujumbura </LOCATION> until late Tuesday and Wednesday,'' the diplomat said. `` The army went in on Tuesday and got things under control fairly quickly.'' <PERSON> Mbonimpa </PERSON>, the foreign minister, described a media report that at least 24,000 people were killed as `` highly exaggerated,'' another diplomat said, and `` from every report, including those from non-governmental sources, no one believes that figure.'' Neighboring <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION>'s state radio said Monday that 35,000 people had crossed the border. <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>, former Belgian colonies, are among the world's most densely populated countries. Rwandan officials said resources were being strained by the influx of refugees. In <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> said they would send a planeload of tents, blankets and other emergency aid for the refugees worth the equivalent of more than $ 700,000. According to <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION>'s official radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, officials of the neighboring country met Sunday at the border town of <LOCATION> Butare </LOCATION>, where the refugees were gathered. It gave no details. <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> claims last week's violence was caused by expatriate Hutus who infiltrated northern <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> from foreign countries and incited Hutus to massacre Tutsis. The <ORGANIZATION> Hutu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, an exiled opposition group, accused the Tutsi-dominated military of massacring thousands of Hutus, but diplomatic sources said there was no evidence of that. More than 90 percent of the population is Hutu in the northern area around the <LOCATION> Marangara </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ntega </LOCATION> rural communes, where most of last week's killings occurred. <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>'s communique said the government had the situation under control and the military, the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> and the bureaucracy had been ordered to `` show restraint,'' one of the diplomats said. `` It said the policy of the government was one of respect for human rights and of ethnic reconciliation,'' he reported. Maj. <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Buyoya </PERSON>'s government has restricted travel between towns and is not allowing trips into the north, the diplomats said. A 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew is in force throughout the country and meetings of more than five people are prohibited. The tribal battles were the first significant violence reported in <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Buyoya </PERSON> seized power in a bloodless coup Sept. 3, 1987, while then-President <PERSON> Jean-Baptiste </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagaza </PERSON> was abroad. Nearly 5 million people live in <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>, which is about the size of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. Its population is 84 percent <PERSON> Hutu </PERSON> and 15 percent <PERSON> Tutsi </PERSON>. Roughly the same tribal proportions apply in <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION>, which is slightly smaller than <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Judge Hears Statistical Evidence in FBI Discrimination Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> opened its defense Monday in a discrimination trial by presenting four hours of statistics designed to show that Hispanics are promoted as rapidly and disciplined as fairly as other <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents. `` Hispanics have no problem getting into management,'' Dr. <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Klemm </PERSON>, an independent statistical consultant, testified. `` They get what they ask for in terms of promotions.'' The 311 Hispanic agents who joined in the class-action suit in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> contend the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> discriminates against Hispanics in hiring, promoting, disciplining and assignments. They want damages and changes in <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> policies. About 400 of the bureau's 9,000 agents are Hispanic During the first week of testimony, about 40 <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents testified that Hispanics are transferred more often to undesirable offices, are given more assignments that are either less glamorous or more dangerous and receive less recognition for their successes. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> opened the second week of the trial with Ms. <PERSON> Klemm </PERSON>, who disputed findings of Dr. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFree </PERSON>, a sociologist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> LaFree </PERSON> testified last week that Hispanic <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents are less likely to hold higher-level jobs. Ms. <PERSON> Klemm </PERSON> used the same raw numbers culled from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> as <PERSON> LaFree </PERSON> but reached different conclusions. <PERSON> LaFree </PERSON> testified last week that 15 percent of Hispanic <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents with at least five years of agency experience are managers, compared with 21 percent of non-Hispanic <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents with the same level of experience. Ms. <PERSON> Klemm </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Hispanics </PERSON> have done better head-to-head against <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> agents when competing against them for promotions _ that 14.4 percent of Hispanics got such promotions versus 10.5 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> agents applying for the jobs. She did not say how many people from each ethnic background applied for competitive promotions. She said Hispanics have an average of about two years less experience than their <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> counterparts when they attain the bottom rung of the management ladder in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. `` In terms of career advancement, they advance timely,'' she testified. `` Therefore, even if they do different things as Hispanic agents, they do fine as far as advancement.'' The suit was filed in January 1987 by <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Matt </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, who contends he was forced by superiors in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and elsewhere to accept demotions he did n't deserve. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, now the No. 2 agent in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, used to be in charge of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, office and was second-in-command in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> before his transfer to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>. The non-jury trial is expected to end Friday and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Lucius </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON> is expected to reach a decision within six months. Federal employees are not entitled to jury trials when suing the government in discrimination cases. Hispanic activists have said a multitude of discrimination trials could result if the plaintiffs win. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent and the co-counsel for the plaintiffs, has compared the case to those fought by blacks in the'60s and by women in the'70s.

<HEAD>AFL-CIO To Seek Restrictions On Polish Exports</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it will petition the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to restrict Polish exports to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets under provisions in the new trade bill that are designed to safeguard workers' rights. `` We certainly believe the worker rights provisions of the trade legislation should be applied in the case of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>. `` They should be denied access to the American market under those provisions since they are in violation of worker rights.'' <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> made the comments on Monday as the Polish government ordered troops to secure major industrial plants and clamped curfews on three provinces hit by pro-Solidarity strikes following a week of the worst labor unrest since 1981. The trade bill <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is to sign Tuesday in a ceremony before <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, dockworkers includes a provision permitting the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative to retaliate against countries that deny worker rights such as recognition of free trade unions. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said he was told by the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> here last week that his request for a visa to visit the country had been turned down for a third time. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year imported some $ 261.5 million in products from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, primarily canned meat, fish, plates of iron steel, nails, clothing and glassware. <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> officials said the retaliation that the federation would seek from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration could take several forms, including revoking <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s most-favored-nation status as a trading partner. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration revoked that status in 1981 upon the imposition of martial law in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> but gradually restored it, with the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s approval, after martial law was ended. Revocation of most-favored status would raise the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tariffs on imports from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. For canned pork, as an example, the tariff would jump from a penny a pound to 3.25 cents a pound. The tariff on cast iron pipes would jump from 8 percent to 25 percent. Also Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> elected new <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> as a vice president of the federation and to a seat on its policy-setting executive council. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> fills the vacancy on the 35-member board left by the death last month of his predecessor at the Teamster's helm, <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Heavy Rain in Plains, Record Cold in Parts of Northeast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

 The summer of 1988 took an uncharacteristic turn Monday as thunderstorms dumped heavy rain on parts of the <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and overnight temperatures hit record lows in parts of the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>. Storms buffeted several Plains states with gusty winds and heavy rain, helping to replenish some drought-sapped soil and causing some isolated flooding in parts of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. In northwest <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sioux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> recorded over 6 -LCB- inches of rain overnight and Monday morning. The downpour pushed the <LOCATION> Floyd </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> at least 1 foot above flood stage in places and caused minor lowland flooding. Several other locations in that corner of the state reported at least 3 inches of rain by morning. `` It might help the lawns some,'' said <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Hora </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` And the football fields will be green.

 The government on Monday ordered troops to secure major industrial plants and clamped curfews on three provinces hit by pro-Solidarity strikes following a week of the worst labor unrest since 1981. The illegal strikes raised a `` specter of anarchy'' over <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and were a `` glaring violation of peace and order,'' said Interior Minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>. The army general, appearing in uniform on national television, said it was the duty of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s leaders not to allow the country to return to `` the situation before Dec. 13, 1981'' _ the date that martial law was imposed to suppress the outlawed trade union federation Solidarity. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, also commander of the nation's police forces, said it was his duty as interior minister to `` assure elementary discipline.'' Even before he spoke, strike organizers said riot police stormed two strikebound streetcar depots in <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION> and a bus depot near the city, evicting the workers and detaining at least 150 of them in the first police action in the week of labor unrest. In addition to authorizing curfews in the provinces of <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Katowice </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> said he ordered law enforcement forces `` to strengthen external protection'' around factories and to prevent outsiders from being present in the plants. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> said the army was asked to allot troops to `` assure the continuity of city transport everywhere it has been immobilized,'' and misdemeanor courts were advised to jail violators in summary proceedings rather than merely fining them. Katowice is the southern province where miners in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Silesian </LOCATION> coal fields have been striking for a week for higher pay and recognition of Solidarity Hundreds of workers at the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> shipyard in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> _ the birthplace of Solidarity _ joined the strikes Monday, seizing the main gate of the facility, chanting the name of the banned union and waving <LOCATION> Polish </LOCATION> flags. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> said the strikes were being carried out by only a minority of workers at the affected plants, but had dire consequences for the economy. Sit-in strikes were in effect Monday in 13 state enterprises employing more than 90,000 workers. `` Depending on further developments of the situation we shall reach for appropriate measures which are available within the existing law,'' <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> said, speaking in deliberate tones for between five and 10 minutes, and making no mention of the police raid in <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION>. Wroclaw opposition leader <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinior </PERSON> said after hearing the speech on television that `` The authorities may succeed in pacifying the strikers now, but the wave of strikes will return in one, two or three months.'' <PERSON> Romuald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziolkowski </PERSON>, chairman of the strike committee at the <LOCATION> Dabie </LOCATION> bus depot in <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION>, said that during the raid, the riot police were throwing strikers `` into police vans like pigs.'' `` There was crying and screaming there,'' he added. Raids also occurred at streetcar stations and at the bus depot in Police, a city outside of <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION>, about 7 p.m., <PERSON> Ziolkowski </PERSON> said. About 100 people were at each of the three depots, and 50-70 people were detained at each site, he said. The strikers were greatly outnumbered and `` they resisted passively,'' he said without elaborating. Before the police action in <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION>, authorities had detained at least 10 people nationwide and threatened criminal charges against strike organizers. `` We must fight for reforms. We must fight for Solidarity. There is no other way,'' Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told a crowd of young workers at the 10,000-worker Lenin shipyard. The shipyard has been in ailing financial shape and is under threat of closure, but has symbolic importance as the birthplace of the Solidarity trade union eight years ago. The ongoing strikes at 10 coal mines were costing the country $ 1.3 million a day, the government said. Coal exports are a major source of hard currency to repay <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s daunting $ 39 billion foreign debt, the biggest in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. Some <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> port workers also began striking Monday, according to Western journalists in the city. A Solidarity spokesman, <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON>, said 3,000 dockworkers in the city were on strike. Although the shipyard strike had been announced in advance, police did not interfere as workers marched around the sprawling yard bearing Polish national flags and took over the main gate at 8:35 a.m. Later in the morning, riot police moved in to cordon off approaches to the yard. In scenes reminiscent of a nine-day strike at the shipyard in May that ended without a settlement, strikers chanted Solidarity slogans and posted banners on the shipyard fence, helping some supporters who had been locked out to scramble over the gate. Shortly after, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> arrived in a red compact car and rallied the strikers. `` Everything is closed and the whole shipyard is on strike,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said later by telephone from his home in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was spending the night in the Lenin shipyard with about 1,000 strikers, said union adviser <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON>. Sources said police allowed <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, because of his stature, to re-enter the plant after the cordon was in place. In the phone interview from his home, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> blamed the strikes on authorities, whom he said have refused to engage in dialogue with workers. `` I wanted to avoid strikes,'' he said. `` We should n't be striking. We should be working. But there was no other choice ... We are still waiting for serious talks.'' None of the shipyard's towering cranes appeared to be operating, and a foreman speaking through a fence said all departments were shut down. Workers could be seen strolling, taking naps or perching on fences and walls around the yard. `` If you work only eight hours a day, you make 40,000 zlotys -LRB- $ 89 -RRB- a month, and that's not enough to make a living,'' said one man in his mid-20s. Opposition groups reported at least 10 instances of unrest at various factories around the country Monday. Activists in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> reported an attempt to start a strike at the 14,000-worker <ORGANIZATION> Ursus </ORGANIZATION> tractor plant outside the capital. Police dispersed a morning rally at the plant and detained three people, activist <PERSON> Maciej </PERSON> <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON> said. A management spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> Ursus </ORGANIZATION> confirmed an unsuccessful attempt to strike at the plant, but made no mention of police and said work continued normally. In southeastern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, Solidarity organizer <PERSON> Ewa </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuberna </PERSON> said workers rallied at the 18,000-employee <ORGANIZATION> Stalowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wola </ORGANIZATION> steel mill and heavy machinery plant, and a strike was launched by 2,000 of the workers. Opposition spokesman <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Maziarski </PERSON> also reported new strikes or partial strikes at the Cegielski turbine works in <LOCATION> Poznan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Warszawa </LOCATION> steel mill in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> and the Railroad Construction Enterprise of <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION>. Government spokesman <PERSON> Ryszard </PERSON> <PERSON> Straus </PERSON> said he had no information about any stoppages at <LOCATION> Cegielski </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION> railroad enterprise.

 A senior <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> cleric said Monday the holders of foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> should stick to their demands `` until death.'' <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tufaili </PERSON> spoke to 25,000 <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> faithful marking the death of the Shiite Moslems' most revered saint, Imam <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>. In a clear reference to <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION>, the group that holds at least two American hostages, <PERSON> Tufaili </PERSON> said: `` I turn to those holding the prisoners -LRB- foreign captives -RRB- in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, although we do not accept to hold the hostages. I tell them: Adhere to your demands. Do not let go of them or retreat until death.'' Demands made by Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, include release of prisoners form Arab and foreign prisons, release of Lebanese and Palestinians from <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> jails and withdrawal of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. It has specifically demanded freedom for 17 Shiites imprisoned in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> for bombing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies there in 1983. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, has <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s support and is widely believed to be the umbrella organization for <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> extremist groups holding most of the 18 foreigners missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, who include nine Americans. Held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985. <PERSON> Tufaili </PERSON> closed his remarks by declaring to hostage holders: `` You must protect them -LRB- the demands -RRB- by all means.'' Listeners in the ancient city of <LOCATION> Baalbek </LOCATION> beat their chests with fists and chanted: `` God Is Great!'' <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, the Shiites' martyr, and a group of his followers were massacred in 680 in what is now the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> province of <LOCATION> Karbala </LOCATION> in a leadership fight between Moslem factions. Moslems subsequently formed the Shiite and Sunni sects of the faith. Other parades and observances were held Monday in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s southern slums and in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, where thousands of Shiites slashed their heads with razors or beat themselves with swords, axes or iron bars Blood dripped from the faces and chests of men and children as they re-enacted the killing of <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>. No deaths were reported in the special parades, known as Ashoura. In southern <LOCATION> Nabatiyeh </LOCATION>, traditionally the focal point of the Ashoura, 50,000 people gathered in the main square to re-enact the killing. Afterward, scores sliced themselves with razors and clubbed themselves with swords or axes. Some lost consciousness and were taken to hospitals for treatment. In southern <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> delivered a sermon to mark the anniversary. He is the sect's most influential cleric in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and the reputed spiritual guide of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> gave his sermon in the air-conditioned Bir el-Abed Mosque. The hostages, who include nine Americans, are widely believed held in <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Hay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madi </LOCATION> barracks building, about 10 blocks from the mosque. <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> omitted his habitual references to foreign hostages but accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> of trying to snatch `` our natural resources and then claim them as theirs.'' `` When we say ` Death to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>' we mean death to the aggressive policy of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, death to the colonial policy of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and not death to the people of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> said. `` We are open to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, mostly to the oppressed blacks who are being treated as second-class citizens,'' he added. When the sermon ended, about 10,000 faithful _ including hundreds of women and girls clad in black chadors that covered everything except for their eyes _ began their parade in the areas they control in war-torn south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Many of the marchers carried either red flags, symbolizing <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s blood, or black ones for mourning.

The list is compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Center Against Apartheid. Other Americans placed on the list are actors <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Windom </PERSON>, actress <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, singers <PERSON> Della </PERSON> <PERSON> Reese </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON>, theatrical directors <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Levey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, conductor <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, opera singer <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoes </PERSON> and violinist <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. The center's report, released this month, said the people whose names were newly added to the list appeared in white-controlled <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 1987-88. More than 500 individuals ang groups from 33 countries and territories are on the list, which dates back to 1981.

The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s Special Committee Against Apartheid, which the center serves, said in a foreword to the report, that artists and entertainers, `` representing a most sensitive and freedom-loving part of humankind are capable, by their example, to exert an important influence on public opinion and can contribute positively to world action against apartheid.'' By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs.

 A 3-year-old boy playing along the bank of a river in the western <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle was crushed and swallowed whole by a 45-foot anaconda, newspapers reported Monday. They said the boy's father tried in vain to save him from the jaws of the anaconda, a long, heavy South American snake of the boa family. `` The boy, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Menezes </PERSON>, had accompanied his father, <PERSON> Joao </PERSON>, to the river to catch fish. With fish in hand, the father started walking to his small wooden shack a few feet away when he heard screams. He looked back and he saw his son's neck in the jaws of the snake,'' said <PERSON> Jorcene </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, a reporter for <ORGANIZATION> O </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estadao </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> spoke to The Associated Press by phone from the jungle city of <LOCATION> Porto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Velho </LOCATION>, 2,045 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>. He quoted the father as saying the incident occurred Aug. 8 along the <LOCATION> Jaru </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. `` It took the family two weeks to travel the more than 185 miles to <LOCATION> Porto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Velho </LOCATION>, where they told us what had happened,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said. He said the father rushed to his home, grabbed an old rifle and `` ran back to the river in a desperate attempt to save his son. But when he got to the river he saw the anaconda had already crushed his son's bones and had started swallowing the body. There was nothing left to do.'' <PERSON> Menezes </PERSON> is an impoverished peasant who plants `` manioc root and hunts and fishes to feed his family,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said. The Jaru winds through thick jungle and is infested with man-eating piranha, alligators and snakes, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said. The anaconda, one of the world's biggest non-poisonous snakes, kills by crushing its victims, then swallows them whole.

 Federal police seized three Brazilians on kidnapping charges and freed unharmed two Canadian businessmen who were being held for nearly $ 500,000 ransom, police and diplomatic officials said Monday. A fourth gang member, identified as <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarmiento </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, is being sought, federal police spokesman <PERSON> Paulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Marra </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Marra </PERSON> said 35 police agents surrounded the kidnappers Sunday and freed <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Desy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Camille </PERSON> <PERSON> Cote </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Desy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> livestock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> as a company employee was about to hand over $ 60,000 in cash at the airport of <LOCATION> Goiania </LOCATION>, 135 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. The two Canadian men, both in their mid-40s, had been held since Aug. 17, he said. The Canadian Embassy in <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Desy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cote </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> on Aug. 14 to conclude a sale of cattle to a Brazilian group. `` Apparently there was a falling out with some of the members over commissions. Last week we heard the people -LRB- Desy and Cote -RRB- were being held against their will, and it evolved into a kidnapping and extortion,'' embassy spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Benoit </PERSON> said by telephone. <PERSON> Benoit </PERSON> said the Desy company was contacted for the ransom. He said Brazilian federal police were alerted though diplomatic channels and that Canadian police also were notified. <PERSON> Marra </PERSON> said Brazilian authorities were unaware of the cattle deal and that the two Canadians were officially in the country as tourists. He said the kidnappers demanded $ 60,000 in <LOCATION> Goiania </LOCATION> in exchange for one of the hostages. The other was to be released in exchange for an additional $ 437,000 to be delivered in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. A police team surrounded the agreed-on exchange point at 8 a.m. and surprised the kidnappers when they showed up nine hours later, he said.

 A former dean at the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> said Monday he was confident <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> received no special consideration when he gained admittance to the school in 1970. `` I'd bet a dollar against a doughnut there was nothing unusual or irregular about his admission to law school,'' said Prof. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, the dean from 1973 to 1979. `` I was familiar with admissions during the'70s and am confident if there had been something wrong I would have known about it,'' <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s father, meanwhile, also challenged allegations that family influence helped his son gain admittance to the law school or secure a state job. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, who taught the 41-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nomineee during his last year of law school, described him as a `` very solid'' student. `` I remember him well enough to say without reservation that he is not a lightweight or superficial,'' <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said. `` I had a high regard for him. He was a very hard worker, gave excellent recitations and had a very keen perception of the law.'' <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> made his comments shortly after current deans of the law school said at a news conference in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> that school policy prohibited them from making public any confidential information related to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s admission to the school. Associate Dean <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Frandsen </PERSON>, who is acting dean in the temporary absence of Dean <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefstein </PERSON>, had huddled with other top administrators at the law school all day Monday figuring out how to reply to press inquiries about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the law school news bureau. A report published Sunday in The Plain Dealer in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> alleged that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> did not meet the admissions requirements for the law school, but gained entrance after meeting with the admissions dean, a Republican judge in a city where <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s family owned the local newspaper. The candidate's father denied that charge. `` What people are trying to say is that <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> got his way paid in to law school, `` said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` They're trying to build him up like an aristocrat and then tear him down.'' The elder <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, publisher of the <ORGANIZATION> Huntington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald-Press </ORGANIZATION>, said there was no truth to accusations that his son was admitted to the law school with the help of his maternal grandfather, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulliam </PERSON>, publisher of several newspapers in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. `` Mr. <PERSON> Pulliam </PERSON> was a great philanthropist and he gave money all the time to lots of schools in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, as well as to zoos and hospitals,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` But I'd risk my arm on the fact he never gave money to the law school. His interest was in journalism and getting better journalists.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> described himself as the `` proverbial C + student'' during an interview Monday on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America,'' but said that his family played no role in his admission to law school `` What <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> did is he went down and talked somebody at the <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> law school and pointed out that he went to a private school,'' the elder <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said of his son, who graduated in 1969 from <ORGANIZATION> DePauw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> a small liberal arts college in <LOCATION> Greencastle </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, in a telephone interview, conceded that his son `` had n't put his academic skills together'' while at <ORGANIZATION> DePauw </ORGANIZATION> `` He was no Mensa, but it was his thought that he probably got a better education because they had much smaller classrooms and the curriculum was defined for them,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` Somehow he convinced them.'' The young <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s personality also helped gain him a spot in 1970 on the staff of Attorney General <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sendak </PERSON>, according to <LOCATION> Medford </LOCATION> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, who was instrumental in directing the aspiring lawyer to the Statehouse job. `` I think he probably got himself hired in the interviews,'' said <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a former editor, political columnist and editor at the <PERSON> Pulliam </PERSON> family owned <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was an impressive young kid.'' `` I would guess they -LRB- <PERSON> Sendak </PERSON>'s staff -RRB- would take a look at academic records but I think they would be influenced also by how he handles himself,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. `` This is an office that dealt with the public.'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, who now is a staff member of the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, denied that family members pulled strings for the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator, who worked his way through law school. `` If the <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> family had been that thick with the state government, there would not have been any reason to contact me,'' said <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, who contacted <PERSON> Sendak </PERSON>'s office on behalf of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who was then 22. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s father also disputed that the family is enormously influential in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, as has been widely reported. `` People keep saying -LRB- <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> -RRB- is from a prominent family, but I tell you we run a paper with 9,500 readers. That does n't carry a lot of weight,'' the elder <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` I like my new prominence,'' said the senior <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` The only thing is I ca n't find the wealth.''

<TEXT>
 The nation's largest labor federation said Monday it would call a strike by its 3.5 million members next month to protest the economic policies of President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>. The walkout was scheduled for early September but an exact date will not be set until later this week, said <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ubaldini </PERSON>, secretary-general of the General Labor Confederation. The one-day general strike would be the 12th walkout organized by the labor group since <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> took office in December 1983. A march by thousands of workers in the capital also is planned. The strike is being called to protest government economic policies that union leaders say have caused serious inflation and eroded the purchasing power of workers. Most Argentine unions belong to the federation. Its 11 previous general strikes have been peaceful and fairly successful, shutting down government offices and public transportation, although private businesses have remained open. The cost of living rose 178 percent during the first seven months of this year. After it increased 25.6 percent in July, <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> devalued the austral by 11.4 percent against the dollar, implemented budget cuts and instituted a system of voluntary price controls. Wages have not kept pace with inflation, and prices continue rising despite voluntary controls. The labor federation has demanded an increase in the minimum monthly wage, from the current $ 66 to $ 121. The federation on Friday rejected the government's offer to boost the minimum wage to $ 79. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> is asking the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> for $ 1.2 billion and the success of his economic recovery plan is a key issue in the May presidential and legislative elections. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> has a $ 56 billion foreign debt. Half of the 254 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> and about one-third of the 46 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will be up for election in May. A new president will take office in December 1989, when <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s six-year term expires. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> is barred by the constitution from running again.

<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> are delving into the $ 92 million taxpayer-funded trough for the general election, with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> getting to his share first. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> got a headstart on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by receiving his party's nomination almost a month before the Republicans formally picked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last week That meant he got his $ 46.1 million from the federal <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> earlier and has already spent $ 1.8 million, according to July financial reports available Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, however, has wasted no time in laying the groundwork for his general election campaign. He had borrowed money against the $ 46.1 million he stood to receive once he became the official nominee. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had spent $ 672,570 on his general election effort as of the end of July, his financial report shows. He borrowed money he raised during the primary campaign for his `` compliance fund,'' used for expenses to comply with election law administrative requirements. Unlike the primary campaign, the candidates do not have to raise money privately for the general election. They receive $ 46.1 million from the federal fund that is supported by the voluntary $ 1 checkoff on individual tax returns. As the general election campaign gets under way, the candidates have invested heavily in polling and in media production for ads that will be used between now and November. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> invested more than $ 300,000 in polling last month. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been spending more money getting ready for the TV wars, paying more than $ 127,000 during July for media production and consulting to the firm of his media consultant <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON>. In addition to what the candidates are allotted, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and Democratic party organizations can spend $ 8.3 million each to help elect their nominees. The limit applies to direct spending, but the parties also have devised other ways to indirectly help their tickets, through use of so-called soft money for generic party activity. Those efforts will result in spending many times the limit on direct party support. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> closed out the last month of his primary campaign having spent $ 21.7 million against the federally imposed $ 23 million limit on primary spending, his reports showed. He still owed $ 469,000 in outstanding bills, and his campaign committee was owed nearly that much in receiveables. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was scrimping to keep from topping the limit by the end of the campaign, was up to $ 22.6 million against the $ 23 million cap at the end of July. He was owed $ 255,183 and had $ 61,446 in debts.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Young people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are living at home longer, marrying later and taking more time to become self-sufficient, according to a government report released Monday. Assistant Education Secretary <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said the study of youth aged 14 to 24 indicates they are `` staying younger longer.'' `` They seem to be becoming autonomous, self-supporting individuals at a slower rate than was once the case,'' <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> said. The report, titled `` Youth Indicators: Trends in the Well-Being of American Youth,'' was compiled from information that had been collected since 1950 at federal agencies and private organizations. <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> said the figures show young people `` are living with their parents longer and they are slower to form their own families.'' `` A number of indicators suggest that the transition from childhood to adulthood is taking longer and presenting more pitfalls than was the case several years ago,'' the study said. `` Youths in the 20s are living at home measurably longer; since 1970, they have been delaying marriage to significantly later ages; and since 1980, they have found their average earnings declining while those of older workers have increased.'' Among the findings: _ The share of youth aged 18 to 24 who lived with their parents or in college dormitories rose from 43 percent in 1960 to 53.6 percent in 1985. _ The number of first marriages per 1,000 never-married women aged 20 to 24 fell from 220.1 in 1970 to 104.4 in 1984. _ Median income for women aged 20 to 24 fell from $ 12,517 in 1980 to $ 12,192 in 1986, using constant 1986 dollars. The comparable figures for young men fell from $ 16,113 in 1970 to $ 14,152 in 1986. The study said the trends may be related, since `` late marriage is a reasonable response to lower earnings; living with parents is a reasonable arrangement for those not earning enough to support themselves.'' <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> said the report also showed falling scores on college entrance examinations and a last-place ranking for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> students in recent international science and mathematics tests, raising concern about how the youth will fare in the future. `` Compared to kids elsewhere in the world they are performing poorly on all kinds of tests and that makes me worry,'' he said. `` They make me worry about the future of a country that's raising up people with a number of years in school but that do n't know anything.''

 Current Soviet culture is `` chaotic'' and the reforms of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> resemble those in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> before the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion of 1968, a Czechoslovak educator has written. <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Fojtikova </PERSON>, head of the Russian Department at <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Charles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the wife of the <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s chief ideologist, <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fojtik </PERSON>, took a critical view of current Soviet reforms in an article published Friday in the cultural weekly Kmen Her views of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, or openness on selected subjects, come at a time when <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> is trying to find its own way toward greater openness, democracy and economic restructuring. <PERSON> Fojtik </PERSON>, who was elected full member of the ruling Politburo in April, is expected to chair a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> plenary session on ideology sometime next month. `` The present state of Soviet culture is very chaotic,'' said the article by Mrs. <PERSON> Fojtikova </PERSON>. `` There is a marked effort of newspaper journalism to suppress moderate opinions, all efforts to guard and not betray the indisputable values created as a result of the revolution and Socialist construction.'' She added, `` It is not progress to substitute one cult lie with another lie, another one-sidedness. With all due criticism of -LRB- Soviet dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, let us not forget that the cult is not created by one person alone ...'' <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s brutal regime has come under sharply increased public condemnation under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` We know from experience that idols are knocked down, mostly to make room for new idols,'' the article said. The article also drew an apparent parallel between <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> prior to the 1968 Soviet-led invasion and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> today. <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact forces invaded <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> after a series of reforms that came to known as the `` Prague Spring.'' `` It is not possible to forget that in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> people did not live through a period of Hungarian, Czechoslovak or Polish counterrevolution ... and have no direct experience with it. Therefore, many illusions persist and -LRB- all -RRB- the greater is the danger.''

 Doubling the distribution of `` The Last Temptation of Christ'' did n't translate into double ticket sales for co-distributor <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>, according to weekend box-office figures. `` The Last Temptation of Christ'' was shown to moviegoers in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this past weekend on 18 screens, with a box-office gross of $ 476,623, or $ 26,459 per theater.

 The Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, wearing a cross of twigs given by farm labor leader <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, entered the second day of a three-day fast Monday by urging consumers and grocers to boycott <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> table grapes. `` Children are dying in clusters of cancer,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said at a protest rally in front of a supermarket here. `` We can stop buying grapes but we ca n't bring back the children,'' he said. Thirteen children have been diagnosed with cancer in the farming community of McFarland, 125 miles northwest of here. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> is calling for a ban on five pesticides used on grapes, claiming they cause cancer. State and federal health and agricultural officials have not pinpointed the cause of the cancer cases and tests on grapes so far have not yielded any conclusive link. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> began his fast Sunday during an outdoor Roman Catholic Mass in <LOCATION> Delano </LOCATION>, as farm workers union president <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> ended a 36-day hunger strike. The former candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination said he would pass the cross, which he wore on a chain around his neck, to the Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, on Wednesday in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> is scheduled to turn the cross over to actor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> Saturday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> during the 25th anniversary celebration of the civil rights march on the capitol. `` The fast will and must continue,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said to about 75 mostly Hispanic protesters marching and chanting `` No Mas Uvas -LRB- No More Grapes -RRB-.'' When asked how he was feeling after not eating for 24 hours, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said: `` I may become weaker physically but stronger morally.'' A grape growers spokesman who attended the rally called the boycott a front for the union's political aims of signing growers to contracts. `` The same pesticides are being used on other produce, but the union does n't complain because the other growers have union contracts,'' said <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, a representative of the <ORGANIZATION> Grape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>.

But <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> said, `` The union is very confident that that settlement will be upheld in any court.'' <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>, a spokesman for the so-called `` Forgotten 400,'' said the suit stemmed from an agreement reached in May between the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> and two <ORGANIZATION> A.T. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiaries to end selective strikes launched against two eastern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> mines in 1984. The agreement, requiring payment of $ 4.47 million to the union, also settled a lawsuit challenging <PERSON> Massey </PERSON>'s decision to turn the <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> and <PERSON> McInnes </PERSON> mines at <LOCATION> Sidney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, into non-union operations. About 700 miners, including <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>, worked at the two mines until February 1983 when all but a maintenance crew were laid off. The remaining miners lost their jobs Sept. 30, 1984, the day before the two mines were sold to <ORGANIZATION> Sidney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Ora </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an operation owned by <PERSON> Massey </PERSON>. After the agreement was announced, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said the $ 4.47 million for lost wages and benefits would be divided among some 250 miners, who had been on selective strikes, with each receiving about $ 18,000. <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> said the lawsuit contends that the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> breached its duty of fair representation by limiting the number of members who would receive payments. The plaintiffs also contend they have been excluded from union meetings, thus violating the organization's constitution The lawsuit asks for a jury trial, plus $ 500 million in compensatory and $ 500 million in punitive damages. <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> pushed for the union's use of selective strikes, and on Oct. 1, 1984 <ORGANIZATION> Massey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> became the first target after the company refused to sign the union's national coal wage contract. Signing would have given <PERSON> Massey </PERSON>'s laid-off employees companywide re-employment rights. The union finally called off the sometimes violent strike in December 1985 when <PERSON> Massey </PERSON> agreed to settlement of an unfair labor practice charge, but selective strikes against the two subsidiaries continued until May.

<HEAD>Eurotunnel Confirms Delays in Channel Tunnel Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eurotunnel </ORGANIZATION>, the Anglo-French consortium set up to build a 31-mile rail tunnel between <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, confirmed on Monday that the project is running well behind schedule. <ORGANIZATION> Eurotunnel </ORGANIZATION> issued a formal warning to Transmanche-Link about its likely failure to meet several constuction targets. Transmanche-Link is a joint venture of British and French construction companies which has the contract to design and build the tunnel by May 1993. <ORGANIZATION> Transmanche-Link </ORGANIZATION> declined to comment on the delays in the tunnel project. <ORGANIZATION> Eurotunnel </ORGANIZATION> warned that Transmanche-Link could face fines if it does not speed up the rate of tunneling. A <ORGANIZATION> Eurotunnel </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, who was not identified, in accordance with British custom, said <PERSON> Transmanche-Link </PERSON> is `` not yet managing the tunneling program to our satisfaction.'' Tunneling on the British side is at about half the rate targeted in the contract, <ORGANIZATION> Eurotunnel </ORGANIZATION> said. Transmanche-Link has bored only 1.1 miles of one tunnel, against the 2.4 miles due by early last week. The link is to have three tunnels. The rate of tunneling is running at about 380 feet a week, compared with a target of 660 feet a week. Tunneling on the French side also is behind schedule, <ORGANIZATION> Eurotunnel </ORGANIZATION> said. Project delays could affect banks' willingness to inject funds into the project, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON>, an analyst at the brokerage <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> and Drew. So far, the tunnel work has been financed with funds raised through the sale of $ 1.3 billion worth of stock in the consortium. Once those funds have been exhausted, <ORGANIZATION> Eurotunnel </ORGANIZATION> can draw on an $ 8.5 billion loan signed last November with a syndicate of commercial banks. But the banks have to be satisfied that sufficient progress on the project has been made before they commit any money, <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON> said. `` They will have a very hard look at the project before putting any money in,'' he added. The first drawdown of the bank financing is due in October, <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Eurotunnel </ORGANIZATION> units, which are made up of one share in <ORGANIZATION> Eurotunnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and one in <ORGANIZATION> Eurotunnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, were off 12 pence -LRB- 20 cents -RRB- at 313 pence -LRB- $ 5.29 -RRB- on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> by late Monday afternoon.

 A leftist coalition whose leaders are linked to Marxist-led guerrillas announced Monday it will participate in the March presidential elections. Leftist parties have boycotted elections since civil war began in late 1979. They said their security could not be guaranteed and that elections formed part of a U.S.-directed counterinsurgency plan. In the past, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> government of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> has invited leftist political leaders to participate in elections but asked the guerrillas to lay down their arms. The Democratic Convergence, a coalition of three left-of-center parties, said Monday it will choose its candidates in coming weeks. The coalition includes the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ungo </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, are the president and vice-president, respectively, of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. The front forms a civilian-military alliance with the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the guerrilla army battling the U.S.-backed government. An estimated 65,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in the civil war. The guerrillas condemned previous elections as farces, but leftist civilian politicians recently said guerrilla leaders understand their decision to take part in the March elections. `` Our objective in the electoral process is the promotion of a political and negotiated solution to the armed conflict as an indispensable condition for fulfilling the <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> people's most pressing demands,'' a communique issued by the Convergence said. `` The upcoming elections will not in themselves resolve the fundamental problems of our society ... but we are convinced that our participation will bind and mobilize people around the objectives of social justice, democracy, national independence and peace.'' The election is likely to be a close contest between <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s two dominant parties, the incumbent <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> and the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>. The alliance, known as <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, gained control of the legislature and two-thirds of the country's municipal governments in elections held in March. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> has been diagnosed as having terminal liver cancer.

<TEXT>
 Faced with a third straight summer of low rainfall, officials ordered most of the town's 4,500 residents and businesses to cut water use by 20 percent Monday. `` The gut of the problem is we have n't gotten any rain,'' City Manager <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Shivar </PERSON> told a news conference. `` If we had gotten the kind of showers that fell this weekend in <LOCATION> Sanford </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>, we would have substantially reduced our problem,'' <PERSON> Shivar </PERSON> said referring to two other central <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> cities. The main reservoir supplying this town 50 miles west of <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> is more than six feet below its normal level, reducing the available water supply to about 44 percent of normal, <PERSON> Shivar </PERSON> said. If customers continue to use water at the current rate of about 2.2 million gallons a day without substantial rainfall, the city could run out of water in about 41 days, <PERSON> Shivar </PERSON> said. Mayor <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON>' order Monday mandates a water allocation system requiring residents and most businesses to cut water use by 20 percent immediately. The order requires two large poultry producers _ <ORGANIZATION> Townsend </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> and Mid-State Farms _ to reduce water consumption by 30 percent. <PERSON> Shivar </PERSON> said the two poultry companies, which employ about 500 people, use about 42 percent of the city's water supply. Voluntary conservation measures have reduced daily consumption to just less than 2.2 million gallons from about 2.47 million gallons, <PERSON> Shivar </PERSON> said. Monday's order is designed to reduce daily usage by an additional 300,000 gallons. Anyone found violating the order a third time could be penalized with fines and termination of service. Residents could face stricter restrictions in the coming weeks unless consumers cooperate, <PERSON> Shivar </PERSON> said. `` We might not be able to avoid layoffs,'' he said. So far, no businesses have had to cut back on production because of the water crisis, he added.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday defended his besieged running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, as a patriot who served honorably in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and at least `` did not go to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'' to avoid the Vietnam War. And <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told a veterans group in a hastily arranged speech that he pulled no strings to get into the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> because his unit `` had openings before I applied, they had openings when I applied, and they had openings after I applied.'' `` My national guard unit was never called up to active duty, but let me say that after these last 72 hours no one can say I've never faced combat,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told 2,500 whistling and cheering members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke earlier to the VFW convention in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, strongly defending his running mate. He said after his appearance that he wants to speak out for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> because `` I want to get that -LRB- campaign -RRB- focus where it belongs, which is Bush-Dukakis, and that's what I tried to do.'' The Republican National Convention boosted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to a narrow lead over <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 46-40, according to a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll released Monday. The same poll, however, revealed serious reservations about the <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> choice as a running mate. Half the respondents in the survey said they did not believe <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has the experience to be a good president, and another 28 percent were unsure. Thirty-nine percent said they wished <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chose someone else. The poll of 1,221 registered voters was conducted Friday through Sunday and had a margin of error of plus or minus three points. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> before an evening national security briefing, referred to the <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> controversy in the context of who Americans would want to be `` a heartbeat away from the presidency'' _ Democrat <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> or <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in his speech, recalled his own record as a bomber pilot in World War II and said he had strong feelings for those who `` fought in the rice paddies'' of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` I hardly ever walk by the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veterans Memorial in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> when I do n't get a lump in my throat or a tear in my eye,'' he said. `` But many others served, too, some in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, some in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> _ people who were not sent overseas,'' like <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` True, he did n't go to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, but his unit was n't sent,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` But there's another truth: He did not go to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, he did not burn his draft card and he damned sure did n't burn the American flag. And I'm proud to have him at my side.'' The vice president said his running mate was the victim of `` shrill, partisan attack.'' He also charged <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with wanting `` unilateral cuts in our defense.'' If the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had embraced the nuclear freeze movement, as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had, `` it would have locked in Soviet superiority in a range of strategic areas,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Lowell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s qualifications `` obviously'' would be an issue to voters `` How we make our decisions, how we make the presidential selections, who we select ... whether or not that person should be a heartbeat away from the presidency, obviously will be an an issue in the campaign,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. The Democrats' national security briefing was being given by <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> and was secret, said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> campaign spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>. The agency traditionally offers the briefing in every presidential campaign, he said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> appeared on some early morning television shows and later invited the press to take photographs in his office, where he was asked if he was going to remain on the ticket. `` I'm <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate,'' he responded. The flap about his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> service would `` get behind us,'' he said. In his television interviews, he reasserted that `` no rules were broken'' to get him into the guard when he joined in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> in 1969. `` I got into the National Guard fair and square, and I do n't believe anybody is alleging anything differently,'' he said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America. `` But somehow this whole National Guard episode is being perceived that joining the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> is something less than patriotic, and I really take strong exception to that,'' he said. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was vacationing in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> declined to comment on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> service. Asked whether the president believed <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> should be dropped from the ticket, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said: `` It is not a relevant question.'' `` Senator <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is the vice presidential candidate and he's a good one,'' he said. The spokesman said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> planned to make between eight and 15 appearances `` all around the country'' on behalf of the ticket. The president would `` draw distinctions between liberals and conservatives, between Democrats and Republicans,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., said he thought it was too early to discuss dropping <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> from the ticket `` If there was something additional that came up that was a distraction or a disqualification, well, the option's always there,'' he said. `` But I do n't see it at this juncture.'' `` I'm not going to call it a mistake yet,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> on Monday denied charges that Panamanian forces are harassing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel, calling the allegations an escalation of a campaign to undermine the government. <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> told a news conference <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials who accused the government of encouraging attacks on Americans were seeking `` an excuse ... -LRB- for -RRB- new and more aggressive measures against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> said Sunday that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> personnel reported at least 240 incidents of harassment by Panamanian officials this year, ranging from extortion for traffic violations to the blocking of mail. The <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> rejected the allegations Sunday night and said in a statement that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops caused problems for Panamanian authorities, including fights, mistreatment of women and shooting in public places. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has applied economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in an effort to force the ouster of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and the country's de facto ruler. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug trafficking and money laundering charges, which he denies. <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said Monday American officials made the allegations to make it appear that `` the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- aggressors become the victims.'' He reiterated Panamanian charges that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was seeking a pretext to annul the 1977 <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaties </ORGANIZATION>, under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is to hand over control of the canal to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Dec. 31, 1999. Col. <PERSON> Rogelio </PERSON> <PERSON> Alba </PERSON>, co-president of a bi-national committee charged with the defense of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, said that <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> officials `` have shown a lack of respect in all things for us.'' <PERSON> Alba </PERSON> said, `` We've gone out of the way to collaborate with them. We've never interfered with them, and they're killing us with hunger.'' _ referring to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions that have crippled <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s economy. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday quoted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Southern Command, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials as saying there have been an increasing number of beatings, abductions, rape and extortion of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel and their dependents. The story, under a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> dateline, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials viewed the incidents as a campaign by the Panamanian government to pressure the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to lift sanctions. But one Southern Command official said Sunday the increased reports of harassment `` could be just an indication of individual frustration and anger.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> imposed economic sanctions on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in March after the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> ousted President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> has since been in hiding, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continues to recognize him as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s legitimate president. About 12,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen are stationed in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> by treaty to protect the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. They are attached to the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military operations south of the U.S.-Mexico border.

 An explosion and fire at the pharmaceutical laboratory associated with Diet Center stores Monday sent clouds of smoke through this eastern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> town, forcing the evacuation of a four-block-wide area. The blast occurred about 3 p.m. in the research and development laboratories at <ORGANIZATION> Ferguson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> while employees were on a break. No injuries were reported, said <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayfield </PERSON>, operations director for the state <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disaster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. Residents and businesses within a two-block radius were evacuated, along with pupils and employees at a nearby elementary school, where classes were just ending. Most of the materials in the laboratory involved vitamins and diet supplements manufactured for the company's 2,300 <ORGANIZATION> Diet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> franchises in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mayfield </PERSON> said. Authorities warned residents, however, that the smoke could contain toxic elements. <PERSON> Mayfield </PERSON> said this was because the fire burned plastic containers, releasing hazardous gases. About 120 employees worked in the laboratories, said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>, co-founder of the Diet Centers with his wife, <PERSON> Sybil </PERSON>. The company had about a 60-day supply of stock in another building, said his son, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>.

 A chartered jet carrying about 80 reporters covering Republican presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was forced to dump fuel Monday and return to <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, officials said. `` It's taxiing to the terminal. There were no reports of injuries,'' said a supervisor at the O'Hare tower who would not be identified by name. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 landed without incident at 2:48 p.m. CDT. He was uncertain how far out of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> the aircraft was when it developed problems. `` They took off and they had a bad flap indicator,'' said <PERSON> Mort </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The reporters had covered the vice president's campaign stop in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, and were flying to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s next campaign stop at <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, authorities said. <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON> said the decision to dump fuel while the plane circled over <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> preparing for an approach to <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> was routine. `` It's a precaution. When you make an emegency landing you do n't want to come in loaded, heavy with fuel,'' <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON> said The plane was chartered from Key Air, based in <LOCATION> Rosslyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Missy </PERSON> <PERSON> Compton </PERSON>, a spokeswoman in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> campaign office. `` It went back to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. They have mechanics there in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> who are going to work on the plane,'' she said. Key Air officials decided Monday evening to ground the plane, and the reporters proceeded to <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> on another aircraft, <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON> said. Key Air Vice President <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said the flap problem was not serious and that the plane could have flown to <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> if the captain had chosen to do so, though at a reduced altitude and speed. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said the flaps on the plane's wings failed to go back to their normal position after takeoff. The incident was the second malfunction in the plane in three days, <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said. During <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s trip to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> over the weekend, smoke entered the jet's cabin as the aircraft landed at <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Airport officials said a hose came loose and allowed a small amount of smoke to leak, but said the problem was minor. The plane continued from <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> on Saturday without incident, officials said.

 Baton-swinging police fired tear gas and charged demonstrators after 10,000 people took to the streets on the 20th anniversary of the Soviet-led invasion that crushed the `` Prague Spring.'' The marchers chanted demands for freedom, the withdrawal of Soviet troops and support for <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, the ex-Communist Party leader who pioneered the reforms of 1968. The size of Sunday's spontaneous protest, the biggest against the invasion since 1969, took foreigners and residents by surprise. Witnesses saw at least eight people detained around the city, including Jan Urban, spokesman for the human rights group Charter 77.

 Monsoon rains hampered efforts to dig through mounds of debris today for more victims of an earthquake that killed more than 480 people as it flattened thousands of homes in the India-Nepal border region. The death toll was expected to climb in Sunday's pre-dawn quake, which triggered landslides and floods and was the mountainous region's deadliest in 38 years. Officials said they had yet to receive reports from the remote Himalayan areas hardest hit by the temblor, which knocked out power and communications and was said to injure at least 3,000 people.

 After 34 years in power, President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is losing the loyalty of young people. Leaders say they are concerned but not alarmed. The trend is most evident in the universities, although no statistics are available to show the exact numbers of youths leaving or refusing to join the governing party. Student governments that formerly were staunchly pro-Stroessner now are dominated by coalitions that challenge the government. Students also are forming new groups. `` I'm a <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> by tradition, not conviction, because you have to be one to work as a public employee,'' said a 20-year-old law student who gave her name only as <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>. She added that she was fired from a government job for voting for an opposition slate of candidates for her student government. `` There is no doubt that the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has been losing influence among the young these days,'' said sociologist <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Morinigo </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Paraguayan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION>, which Education Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> describes as `` one more movement of irregular opposition to the government,'' was set up last year and comprises more than a dozen member groups. The <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> claims 1.4 million members, most of whom are younger than 29 and know no other president than <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, who took power by coup in 1954 and has ruled ever since. He is now 75 years old. The party, after the armed forces, is the strongest institution in this rural, landlocked nation of 3.8 million people. Membership is required for all public employees, and a prerequisite for benefits such as government scholarships. Desertions by youths and challenges by those who chart an independent course from within pose a thorny problem that <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> officials acknowlege they must address. A priority next year is `` the recovery of the diverse student centers that are circumstantially in the hands of the opposition,'' said <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdo </PERSON> <PERSON> Benitez </PERSON>, the party's vice president and <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s longtime private secretary. `` We have made mistakes, but we are trying to set them right and give a greater dynamism to our policies with the young,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiola </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> congressman who is president of the party's <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Student Affairs. Students along with the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> have called on the government to allow more civil rights and political liberties. In May, when Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, dozens of young people at a rally held up their arms, shackled at the wrists with handkerchiefs, to dramatize the lack of freedoms. In July, students boycotted classes at <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to protest the expulsion of the Rev. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>, a Spanish Jesuit priest who had lectured on Liberation Theology, a social reform movement among clergymen. Thousands of youths were among the estimated 20,000 people who in early August marched silently through the streets of the capital in a gesture of solidarity with the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, to which most Paraguayans at least nominally belong. The Rev. <PERSON> Dionisio </PERSON> <PERSON> Daeshague </PERSON>, who helped organize 14,000 youth volunteers for the papal visit, said dissident or independent student groups could be `` a time bomb for the government. All they need is someone to light the wick.'' Party leaders are concerned, but not alarmed. Militant <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> supporters won control of the party at its convention last year. While that alienated some members, it nevertheless demonstrated that <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s power base remains strong. `` Some of the youth call for democracy, but I do n't know what kind of democracy they want and demand because I consider this a democracy,'' said <PERSON> Zoraida </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, vice president of the government-sanctioned <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have peace, we have progress with the government of President <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, a 24-year-old economics student at <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` One has to leave the country to fully appreciate the peace in which we live.''

<TEXT>
 Clad in traditional Arabian robes and headdress, Dr. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> sits in his study, surrounded by the things he loves _ an extensive zoological library, three snakes and a scorpion that paces in a small box. Every so often, a curious ostrich peers through the window. Home for <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> is <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>'s zoo. The 58-year-old Texan was hired specially to establish a zoo in this oil-rich nation and sometime in the future, he said, `` <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> may be breeding more endangered species than many advanced countries.'' <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> spent 15 years as a zoo director in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and another 15 in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` I was bored with conventional zoos,'' he said, and 18 months ago heard that <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION> was planning to open a zoo and needed a director. He packed enough clothes for two weeks and headed for the Saudi capital. He was hired on the spot and given just four months to prepare for the zoo's opening in March 1987. Today, the <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION> zoo is home to 1,200 animals, many of them endangered species. It is also an oasis, carpeted in lush grass and filled with flower beds, bubbling man-made streams, small trees, and flowering vines thriving in the highly irrigated desert soil. Nearly 7,000 visitors a day pass through its gates _ men on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and veiled women on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays, in accordance with <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s Islamic tradition of separating the sexes. To <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>'s residents, the zoo is a welcome change of scenery. To <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, the zoo is much more. `` I really wanted our zoo to have an international reputation for conservation,'' he said. One of his first tasks was to help persuade the municipality to issue a policy statement supporting the <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in Endangered Species -LRB- CITES -RRB-, a treaty designed to protect wild animals in their native countries. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> supports the treaty although it has yet to sign it _ a point <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> thinks will change soon _ but the expression of support made it easy for him to get colleagues all over the world to help stock the zoo. In keeping with CITES guidelines, no endangered species were collected from the wild. An Arabian leopard and an ibex were shipped from <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>'s zoo Pigmy hippos came from the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zoo </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> sent antelopes. <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> sent lemurs. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> contributed a scimiter horned oryx, and a golden lion marmoset came from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>. The zoo in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, sent giant tortoises, the <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> zoo a crocodile, the <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> zoo in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> a kangaroo and two tapirs arrived from the zoo in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. Bedouins, the nomads who live in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s desert, brought in lizards, a caracal and a hyena in the back of pick-up trucks. And so it went, until the zoo's eclectic collection rivaled those of its more established counterparts. `` We've got an Indian mynah who speaks Arabic, and a parrot who speaks Swahili,'' said <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>. `` He's next to a macaw from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and you know what they speak there -LRB- <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> -RRB-. We really have a multilingual zoo; it's like the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>.'' Getting the animals to <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION> was only half the chore. `` The big challenge was acclimatization,'' <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> said. `` We had to make a lot of modifications.'' Upon his arrival, he was given a list of animals approved for acquisition but he rejected some as inappropriate. A wild horse was scratched for want of adequate running space, and several poisonous snakes were eliminated due to lack of staff expertise in handling them. Many animals need special care in order to thrive in <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>'s desert climate. `` The key to acclimatization is spraying and misting systems, so we installed a lot of that,'' <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> said. The zoo also invested in shade cloth, which cuts out 80 percent of sunlight in the summer months, when temperatures often reach 122 degrees. Reptiles accustomed to high humidity are sprayed with water. Like his charges, <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> seems to have adapted to his new environment. He wears the local robes and headdress, known as a thobe and ghutra. He takes frequent desert trips to study and photograph <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s native fauna. `` This country has made remarkable progress. It has a big commitment to conservation,'' <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> said. `` They've already created national parks, there's an endangered species list, and we've got endangered species legislation coming up.''

 Have you ever bought English tea thinking that the royal seal on the package means Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> drinks it? Brace yourself for a disappointment if you did. The warrant does n't guarantee that she does. Actually, <LOCATION> Buckingham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION> wo n't say what Her Majesty prefers `` Does that matter?'' asks <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warrant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` The fact that she might not drink it is irrelevant. That tea goes into Buckingham Palace.'' Nevertheless, the Economist magazine wrote recently, `` Such labels could mislead the unwary for two reasons'' _ a warrant holder can display the royal insignia on goods other than just those it supplies to a palace, and warrants also go to companies supplying palace staff but not the royals themselves. Warrants are dispensed by the queen, the queen mother, Prince <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> or Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>. The warrants entitle holders to put a royal coat of arms on labels, letterheads, trucks and buildings, along with the words `` by appointment'' to whichever royal has given the warrant. The wording changes with the monarch. Royal Worcester, the maker of fine china, got its warrant from King <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> 200 years ago, and today is `` by appointment to Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>.'' Other countries' surviving monarchs also grant warrants, and in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> the practice is centuries old. To win a warrant in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, a tradesman must have supplied the royal household regularly for three years, and gotten paid by the royal family for his goods or services, Buckingham Palace says. Various holders have more than one warrant, but only about a dozen elite, including <PERSON> Harrod </PERSON>'s department store, hold all four. Others, like <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worcester </ORGANIZATION>, take pride in the length of their service to the queen, who grants the most warrants of the four entitled to. The queen's list is studded with luxury goods makers, including 12 jewelers and eight champagne sellers. There also are bagpipe makers, military outfitters, suppliers of venison, chimney sweeps, shipping agents, clock makers, porcelain restorers, purveyors of potted shrimp and sloe gin, suppliers of gold and silver lace, insignia and embroidery, and a heraldic artist. There's even a seller of mopeds on the list. More practical are suppliers who sell eggs and plastic bags and `` installers of intruder alarms,'' something all the more necessary since July 1982, when a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> eccentric broke into the queen's bedroom and woke her up The lists do keep up with the times. They contain, for example, more computer equipment makers than in the past. About 10 to 40 warrants are granted a year. They cost nothing. A Royal Household Tradesmen's <ORGANIZATION> Warrants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> decides once a year who should get a warrant from the queen or her son and heir, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, subject to royal approval, and announce the results in the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gazette </LOCATION>, the government bulletin. Queen <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> and Prince <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> consider applications throughout the year. In olden times the granting of warrants was a more personal affair. According to <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worcester </ORGANIZATION>, it got its warrant from <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> after he happened by the porcelain works and was enchanted with the china. The products do n't have to be British, but most are. `` There are very few outsiders,'' <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON> said. British subsidiaries of foreign companies have won warrants, including American ones, like <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, and the makers of <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s wax. When companies lose their warrants _ because they are n't measuring up, change hands, or the palace's needs have changed _ they are simply omitted from the published list No official reason is given, and no figures are available showing how many have been dropped. But, <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON> said, `` people ... will notice.'' Does a warrant help sales? `` Yes, it does,'' said a <LOCATION> Royal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION> spokesman. `` As you're aware, in this country the royal family is very important. People do take note of it.'' <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schweppes </ORGANIZATION> says it displays royal arms on chocolate bars sold overseas. <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON> said: `` Particularly in the Japanese market and certainly in the American market, it does n't hurt.'' On the question of the queen's tea, <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON> said: `` I would n't make too much play of that particular angle The lovely thing about this is that people's imaginations can run wild. You do n't want to disappoint them.'' Besides, he said, it's not something you'd bring up with the queen. `` I think it would really be wrong, it would be bloody bad manners to inquire ... what her personal likes and dislikes might be.''

<HEAD>Italy Changing Criminal Code Dating Back to Mussolini</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRY LEONARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Over the next year <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> will rid itself of a criminal code enacted by <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Mussolini </PERSON>'s Fascist regime and strengthened by more recent emergency laws to fight political terrorism. In its place <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> has adopted a new code and courtroom procedures that the government hopes will reflect <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s postwar democracy. To strengthen the rights of defendants the new laws demand judicial consent for arrest warrants, severely restrict pre-trial detention and require prosecutors to explain charges and show their evidence during a hearing shortly after an arrest. `` We are finding that the code formed in 1942 under the Fascists does not fit <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s new democracy after the war,'' said <PERSON> Riccardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalla </PERSON> <PERSON> Vedova </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> defense lawyer who has studied the reforms. Under the old code some defendants awaiting trial languished in jail for as long as six years. A prosecutor could order an arrest and the defense would not get a look at the evidence until after the investigation was complete, sometimes shortly before trial. The reforms also allow prosecutors to plea bargain, to trade reduced charges or sentences for testimony that can convict crime bosses and terrorist masterminds. Another change abolishes the verdict of `` not guilty for lack of evidence.'' The finding is short of complete innocence and leaves a cloud of suspicion over the defendants, such as the three Turks and three Bulgarians acquitted of plotting to kill <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> in 1981. The new code will go into force gradually between now and October 1989. `` It solves the problems of pre-trial detention, which I have to admit is one of the wickedest parts of our system,'' said <PERSON> Dalla </PERSON> <PERSON> Vedova </PERSON>. The detentions began in the 1970s, when the state struggled to subdue growing political terrorism from both the far left and right. `` With the kidnapping and killing of -LRB- former -RRB- Premier -LRB- <PERSON> Aldo </PERSON> -RRB- Moro, attacks at the very heart of the state, we had to defend ourselves,'' said <PERSON> Dalla </PERSON> <PERSON> Vedova </PERSON>. But while the pre-trial detention was created to cope with the violence, lawyers and prosecutors agree that it came to be used even for minor crimes. Pre-trial detention now is reserved for murder, kidnapping and terrorism. And prosecutors must convince a judge it is necessary. Prisoners awaiting trial can petition for their release. <PERSON> Dalla </PERSON> <PERSON> Vedova </PERSON> and lawyers <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cherubini </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quirino </PERSON> <PERSON> Mancini </PERSON> said that in common law countries such as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the law evolves by precedent, by <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions. But in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, changes must be written into the law because judges are not bound by earlier high court opinions. `` In <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> a young judge can interpret a law in a completely different way than the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> interpreted it just 10 days before,'' said <PERSON> Dalla </PERSON> <PERSON> Vedova </PERSON>. Italian media often refer to the new code as the `` Perry Mason System.'' But <PERSON> Erle </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>'s fictitious lawyer could well be lost in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> where more than 90 percent of the trials are heard by a judge, not a jury. Still the reforms will allow Italian lawyers for the first time to directly question and cross-examine witnesses rather than suggesting their questions to the presiding judge. Prosecutors now must advise defendants of the charges and disclose their evidence to the defense during a pre-trial hearing within 10 days of arrest. Evidence that had been kept secret until the end of an investigation now must be shared with the defense during a series of other pre-trial hearings. The reforms also curtail the powers of investigating magistrates, who in the past gathered evidence, determined whether to prosecute and ordered the arrest. `` It is right that one changes, and the quicker the better, the musical score for the criminal trial that is out of tune with a state that wants to be truely democratic,'' <PERSON> Corrado </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnevale </PERSON>, a judge with the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cassation </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s highest criminal court, told a recent conference on the new code. As crime became more complicated and sophisticated, and as the investigations became more intricate and involved, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> created the `` maxi-trial,'' such as the <ORGANIZATION> Mafia </ORGANIZATION> trial in <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION> that had 476 defendants. It gave the government a way to deal with massive, organized international crime. `` The handicap is no human mind can absorb 476 positions and sort out all the evidence for and against,'' said <PERSON> Dalla </PERSON> <PERSON> Vedova </PERSON>. So now prosecutors can use plea bargaining to uncover new evidence and to help separate the trials of the principal defendants. Besides the new code, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> has taken other measures to give its criminal justice system the image of fairness. It has made judges liable for damages if they make errors by intent or gross negligence. At the urging of Socialist leader <PERSON> Bettino </PERSON> <PERSON> Craxi </PERSON>, who considered the practice humiliating, police also have been slower to clamp handcuffs on people they arrest. Another measure to be adopted will give journalists immunity from being required to reveal sources on crime stories. And others seek to deal with the backlog in Italian courts by depenalizing some offenses or making them subject only to fines.

<HEAD>A Refreshing Change: Take The Long-Term View</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For a refreshing change, try the long-term economic view. It can relieve you of stress, improve your disposition, allow you to appreciate simple things like a good night's sleep, and probably put a few dollars in your pocket, too. While your neighbors in the game of financial survival cast furtive glances over their shoulders, your demeanor is carefree. Your smile and sturdy stride reflects not foolishness but confidence in your course. All the bad news bounces off your hide: Interest rates, the consumer price index, the balance of payments deficit, the budget deficit, the decline of your particular stocks. Warnings of future financial horrors worry you not. Good riddance to the daily worries; yours is the long-term view. Incredibly, the long-term investment view has been almost forgotten over the past year, although experience shows it is the only realistic way to view a portfolio. Investors have been caught, instead, in the game of trading. Traders try to outguess the market. They are nearsighted, so their view extends from a few hours to a few months. They calculate the value of their investments daily. They can see themselves as rich or poor in the same day. It is a nerve-wracking, mind-boggling, emotion-juggling experience, made all the worse by the realization that there is n't a thing that can be done to overcome the forces affecting the investments It is helplessness. In contrast, the long-run view requires little activity of any sort. It is easy on the nerves. And, while assurance of profit can never be accepted as a given, there is a very good chance the long-term investor will win out. It's in the cards, so to speak. Over the long-term, economic booms and busts cancel out each other, as do volatile swings in stock prices. Over time, sound stocks move in line with fundamental equity values. It's in the records. <ORGANIZATION> Wright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> calculated the annual rates of return for the stocks in the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500-stock average for the past five years, and found this: Dividend income of 3.7 percent and earnings growth of 8.4 percent, for an earned retuurn of 12.1 percent. Changes in the price-earnings ratio for the 500 stocks added another 2.1 percent, for a total retuurn of 14.2 percent. While five years often includes a complete cycle of bull and bear markets, the latest five-year period is an exception. But, tracing the periods all the way back to 1929-1934, he found the annual return still came to 10.9 percent. After examining this evidence, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> projects that over the next five years, to June 30, 1993, we might reasonably expect an annual average of 3.5 percent dividend return and 7.7 percent earnings growth. Because current price-earnings ratios average somewhat higher than they have over the past 40 years, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> projected no growth in this sector. In fact, he deducted 0.6 percent, for a total annual return of 10.6 percent. These returns are averages, which means some quality stocks may perform even better, perhaps doubling in the next five-year period. But even if your stocks perform only to the average, you'd double your money in seven years. Seven years might seem like an age to those who have been focused on the next few weeks, but it is n't for some of the most respected and successful investors. They know they ca n't outguess the market; but they understand also that time and a growing American economy are on their side. In the long-term view, what might seem mountainous obstacles get reduced to specks. Even bear markets, terror of short-termers, are not feared. In fact, they're considered opportunities by patient investors. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Perritt </PERSON>, editor of Investment Horizons, a newsletter, offers this long-term advice: `` Do not be frightened by bear markets. On the contrary, since they present a rare opportunity to accumulate the shares of good companies at bargain prices you should view bear markets in a favorable light. `` Remember, the only time you want stock prices to be at their peak is the day you plan to sell. In the meantime, you should be glad that the stock market periodically places its merchandise on sale.''

<HEAD>Australia's Flying Doctors Still in Air after 60 Years</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto Planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD BILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It's been 60 years since <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s legendary <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flying </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doctor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> took to the air in the vast, sun-scorched interior known as the <LOCATION> Outback </LOCATION> But these days its doctors are more likely to be treating typically urban problems such as alcoholism, suicide and venereal disease than loneliness and broken bones of past days. For doctors in the service, making a house call can mean flying hundreds of miles. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> is virtually the size of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Distances are measured in hours traveled, not miles; schoolchildren in the arid <LOCATION> Outback </LOCATION> are educated over bush radio because no schools are around for hundreds of miles. But no matter where a patient is, the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flying </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doctor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> boasts it is never more than two hours away once a call is made. Last year, the network's 34 aircraft flew 4 million miles to transport 10,295 patients and treat 88,757 others. `` Now that's what you call a country practice,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Partridge </PERSON>, spokesman for the service, an organization that crisscrosses a landscape of about 2 million of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s nearly 3 million square miles. `` We provide a standard of health care that is equivalent to that enjoyed by people in the cities,'' said <PERSON> Partridge </PERSON>. `` People assume that if you live in the country you are healthier. That is not true. `` Alcoholism is very prevalent along with stress-related disorders. The suicide rate is very high.'' The service celebrated its diamond jubilee in May, still committed to providing the `` mantle of safety'' that the Very Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, a Presbyterian missionary, envisioned when air travel was in its infancy. In the beginning, the flying doctors attended women giving birth and mended broken bones of cattlemen who fell off their horses. `` Now, we've also got to deal with tourists, as well as prospectors, anthropologists, archaeologists and surveyors,'' <PERSON> Partridge </PERSON> said. `` We still get the old type of problems, but we're having to attend a growing number of road accidents as well as suicide attempts. Aborigines account for nearly half the people we treat. Hepatitis is a big problem for them, as is VD. We never had that before.'' Based at 14 inland airports, the flying doctors are responsible for some 5,000 outposts scattered across the desolate <LOCATION> Outback </LOCATION>, often having to land at night on dirt strips or paddocks with just car lights showing the way. The network, at its most dramatic, saves lives as well as providing the general practitioner service that city folk are accustomed to. One prime minister, the late Sir <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Menzies </PERSON>, described the service as the `` greatest single contribution to the effective settlement of the far distant back country that we have witnessed in our time.'' <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> established the service with the intent of banishing much of the dread associated with the great loneliness of the Outback and the fear of becoming ill in so isolated a place. `` The inland holds many lonely graves of people who might have lived had they been able to receive medical help quickly,'' said <PERSON> Partridge </PERSON>. The first flight was with the <LOCATION> Queensland </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Territory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, later to become the national flag carrier, <ORGANIZATION> Qantas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>. Now the <ORGANIZATION> Flying </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doctor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> operates separately. The network has become an intrinsic part of Australian folklore. Two television series, `` A Country Practice'' and `` The Flying Doctor,'' are huge successes here as well as in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, where they also are shown. `` They are true to life because we vet the scripts,'' said <PERSON> Partridge </PERSON>. Long ago homesteaders had to pedal a wireless to talk to their nearest neighbor. Some still `` talk'' via <PERSON> bush </PERSON> radio but now almost everyone is hooked up to a telephone service via satellite. <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, or `` <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> of the Inland'' as he was known, began his missionary work at a time when only two doctors served an area of some 186,000 square miles in drought-prone <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> state and 930,000 square miles in the Northern Territory, which is sub-tropical. Today, the service maintains 34 aircraft and employs 18 doctors, 48 pilots, 54 radio operators and 22 engineers. It operates on an annual budget of 16 million Australian dollars -LRB- almost $ 13 million -RRB-, 10 percent of which it raises privately. The government provides the rest. Similar services, based on the Australian example, operate in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The Australian Flying Doctor Service is unique and its headquarters at <LOCATION> Broken </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> is almost a required stop for heads of state visiting <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. Being a pilot for the service entails more than treating the sick. Pilots must do their own refuelling, handling heavy drums at isolated airstrips, and sometimes make emergency repairs. <PERSON> Partridge </PERSON> said at times pilots have landed their Beechcraft turboprops only to smash into a kangaroo. `` You do n't get that in the city,'' he said.

<HEAD>Cracks Appear in Finland's Left-Right Coalition</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cracks are appearing in <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>'s experimental coalition government of socialists and conservatives after 15 months in office From foreign trade issues to budget planning, the two former rivals are finding their new partnership uncomfortable. The Finnish government is run by consensus and state welfare is universally embraced. As a result, issues are low-keyed and changes are incremental, though rhetoric can be heated. Foreign policy direction is the responsibility of the president _ currently <PERSON> Mauno </PERSON> <PERSON> Koivist </PERSON> _ who is elected separately from parliament members. The government formed in May 1987 combined the socialistic <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> with the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, a moderate market-oriented group. The two are ideological opposites and clashes seemed inevitable from the outset. The latest tension was triggered by a secret government decision to allow a Finnish company to buy enriched copper from the multinational La Escondida concern of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, which has a military government. Although <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers had concurred in the decision, their defense of the government was lukewarm when word of the deal leaked out and was criticized in a petition by 70 prominent Social Democrats. The powerful <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> said it will refuse to handle deliveries from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, also controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, said it would campaign for a global boycott `` until democracy returns to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>.'' Trade and Industry Minister <PERSON> Ilkka </PERSON> <PERSON> Suominen </PERSON>, the Conservative party chairman charged that the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> had `` distanced themselves from the government'' and did not `` give sufficient support to government programs.'' In response, the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> chairman, <PERSON> Pertti </PERSON> <PERSON> Paasio </PERSON>, assailed the government's secrecy in the matter. `` It was the wrong way to handle the <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Escondida </ORGANIZATION> deal, especially as the decision forbade government ministers to talk to other leading politicians about the matter,'' <PERSON> Paasio </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The coalition has given the Conservatives a significant role in government for the first time since World War II. They had served briefly and in minor posts only twice since the war. The Social Democrats dominated postwar politics in alliance with the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and its leader, <PERSON> Urho </PERSON> <PERSON> Kekkonen </PERSON>, who was president for 25 years until he resigned in 1981 because of ill health. He died Aug. 31, 1986. <PERSON> Kekkonen </PERSON>, who maintained friendly ties to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, locked the Conservatives out of power in deference to Soviet leaders who objected to the party's hardline anti-Communist position and who feared it might lead <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> away from its neutral foreign policy. Before the 1987 election, then-Prime Minister <PERSON> Kalevi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorsa </PERSON>, a Social Democrat, said cooperation with the Conservatives was `` totally out of the question.'' In the vote for the 200-member parliament, the Social Democrats remained <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>'s largest party with 56 seats, but the Conservatives made sizeable gains by winning 53. A Conservative, <PERSON> Harri </PERSON> <PERSON> Holkeri </PERSON>, was named prime minister and <PERSON> Sorsa </PERSON> became foreign minister. No longer outcasts at home, the Conservatives, it seems, also have become acceptable to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. They recently received their first official invitation to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Suominen </PERSON> will lead a delegation to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in the autumn. The real test for the left-right coalition will be over the 1989 budget and a tax reform proposal aimed at trimming income tax and public spending. The Social Democrats oppose slashing the money underwriting state welfare in the budget, which must go to parliament in early September. At a party conference in mid-August, the Conservatives vowed to cut the maximum marginal tax rate to 40 percent at most, from the current 51 percent on the top tax brackets. By Scandinavian standards, where the top rate can be 75 percent, Finnish taxes are moderate. The Social Democrats, while agreeing to some reforms, stress that any changes should favor the poorer sectors of society. Housing, including the financing of sorely needed rental apartments, is another bone of contention between the two partners. <PERSON> Suominen </PERSON> has suggested selling state-owned company shares, an idea that he said is `` not a problem for us Conservatives, but might cause ideological headaches within the other government party.'' Whether these strains will mean an early end for the coalition is still unclear, but the political mood appears to be one of wait-and-see.

<HEAD>Tiber Lovers Try to Turn the Tide for Rome's Polluted River</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCES D'EMILIO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Smelly sewage notwithstanding, the <LOCATION> Tiber </LOCATION> is having a renaissance. Once the river was the lifeline of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. From ancient times to just a century ago, Romans bathed, fished and washed their clothes in it. <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s unplanned development boom after World War II, however, proved too much for the river. In 20 years, the population swelled from 1 million to more than 3 million. Anyone foolish enough to swim in the Tiber risks fatal infection from the untreated sewage that pours into it daily. Today's Romans do n't have the habit a going down to the river _ a stroll there means sidestepping broken bottles, rats and syringes discarded by drug addicts. But this summer gave Tiber lovers hope the tide is turning their way in the battle against pollution and neglect. With an eye on developing tourist attractions for 1990, when <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> hosts the World Cup soccer games, the city offered free boat rides during July. The response was so great that the promotion was extended into September. Tickets sold out for sunset cruises to the romantic setting of a play performed at the Roman amphitheater at <LOCATION> Ostia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antica </LOCATION>, the Tiber's ancient port. Hot, breezeless nights found young Romans playing cards and dancing on <LOCATION> Tiberina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` The fish will return, there will be pleasure boats. This is n't the Thames, but there's reason to believe the Tiber can be made livable for flora and flauna,'' said <PERSON> Aurelio </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Misiti </PERSON>, a sanitary engineer and professor at <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sapienza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> His department works closely with the city on <LOCATION> Tiber </LOCATION> projects. While dictator <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Mussolini </PERSON> had declared the river contaminated and banned swimming and transport in 1924, <PERSON> Misiti </PERSON> noted, postwar governments did n't get around to prohibiting the dumping of sewage into it until 1976. `` In 1974, <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> started building the first purification plant,'' <PERSON> Misiti </PERSON> said in an interview. `` Now there are four plants, but they can only handle a bit less than half the discharge, and that's just talking about urban waste, not industry's, which is supposed to be handled by the factories themselves.'' The sewage treatment program was supposed to have been completed years ago. <PERSON> Misiti </PERSON> said it should be finished by 1992 and `` after that the Tiber should return to normal.'' Just outside the city, fisherman pull in edible catch from the river, which begins its 251-mile course in the <LOCATION> Etruscan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Apennines </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Paola </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruggeri </PERSON> of the World Wildlife Fund says the city for the most part does n't enforce regulations forcing factories to purify their wastes before spilling them into the Tiber. Since 1982, her group has rented from the city a stretch of riverbank and intends to keep it as a green oasis. Willows, poplars, even a fig tree, lean out to the water, making that stretch look more like <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> than a river channeled through a noisy, traffic-plagued international city. `` Every week volunteers come to clean it and every week we find a mountain of garbage,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ruggeri </PERSON> said. Until about a century ago, the city spilled down to the river banks, leaving <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> vulnerable to devastating floods, roughly every couple of hundred years. After many suggestions, including those of <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Garibaldi </PERSON>, the unification hero, the government began walling off the <LOCATION> Tiber </LOCATION> and demolishing buildings at river-level. Now pedestrians and cars move along, at bridge-deck level, with the Tiber's murky green waters are out of sight below. Earlier this year, when the city planned its annual April 21 celebrations of the legendary founding of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Romulus </PERSON> along the left bank of the <LOCATION> Tiber </LOCATION>, it hosted an exhibit about excavations done in the last 10 years, when the river became a distinct department within the city's Superintendency of Archaeology. Tourists walking along the river can see the excavation of a three-level storehouse for jars of oil, wine and fish sauce left dockside by barges at the ancient port near what is now <LOCATION> Testaccio </LOCATION>, a blue-collar workers' neighborhood. `` In the past, the city lived on its river. <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> was a kind of <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> or a <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Claudio </PERSON> <PERSON> Mocchegiani </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpano </PERSON>, head of the city's underwater archaeology department. `` A thousand years from now, when they dig up artifacts from the 20th century, they'll find out that the Tiber just ran through <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and served as a sewer,'' <PERSON> Carpano </PERSON> said.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ Poliomyelitis, the terror of decades ago, is a disease everyone assumed was over and done with. Not quite. It is staging a mysterious encore for those once afflicted. It's called post-polio syndrome and by any name it's a particularly cruel twist of the knife. The writer is one of thousands of ex-patients at risk.

 There is a terrorist, long believed dead, that is back on the street again. It is not a person. It is a disease or a phantom of it. The disease is poliomyelitis, the once dreaded infantile paralysis, which killed and crippled adults as readily as children, despite its name. Polio has returned in ways not thoroughly understood, as if to have a last laugh on those very victims it maimed 30, 40 and even 50 years ago. It is called post-polio syndrome or post-polio muscular atrophy. It is most likely not a recurrence of the disease itself. It is not fatal. It is or can be crippling. Its victims are only those who have already had polio. A 43-year-old nurse in <LOCATION> Plainfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, is now bedridden, her post-polio working days apparently over. A schoolteacher in <LOCATION> Bridgewater </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Houser </PERSON>, had lost 50 percent of the muscles in what had been her `` good'' hand. Polio survivors who have walked unaided for 30 years are back in braces again. Pain has returned. There may be 500,000 polio survivors in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Doctors have predicted that up to 25 percent of them will have some recurrence of pain, muscle loss, or both. `` It is not a real cheery picture,'' says Dr. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Houser </PERSON> has organized one of some 200 groups of polio survivors nationwide who meet to discuss the return of the malady and educate the medical community, which has sometimes misdiagnosed the symptoms as arthritis or aging. There are 15 studies nationwide into the phenomenon. One at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, Md. is investigating whether the causes stem from some remnant polio virus. Others suspect muscles that have been overloaded to compensate for missing ones have begun giving way from overuse. There are theories that muscle nerve cells that survived have deteriorated from overwork and are not being replaced because polio left the system with a depleted supply. No one is sure. `` We're trying to inform the public, the former patients and the public,'' says Mrs. <PERSON> Houser </PERSON>, who persuaded Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> to declare Polio Survivor Week last June. Polio, always insidious and indiscriminate, has left its survivors with bodies 20 years older than their actual ages, Mrs. <PERSON> Houser </PERSON> was told at a convention of post-polio groups in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> last year. That is why <ORGANIZATION> PPMA </ORGANIZATION> is often mistaken for evidence of aging. To the survivors, it is the return of a specter. Summer in the years before Dr. <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Salk </PERSON> introduced his polio vaccine in 1955 was not just summer. It was the polio season. Mothers fretted over any telltale sign of headache or sore throat or stiffness in their children. Despite the heat, they kept the kids away from public swimming pools. Seemingly by whim the disease would become epidemic in scattered areas of the country. The summer of 1949 was such a year. That was the summer a friend from college and I were making a less-than-grand tour of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. At one point we took a night train from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Heidelberg </LOCATION> in Occupied <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Although visas were hard to come by, the train was crowded. There was one vacant seat on a bench in a third-class coach. Customarily we flipped for who got the mattress in the flea-by-night hotels and inns where they stayed. The loser got the springs. On the train the loser tried to sleep without success amid the feet on the crowded coach. When I got to <LOCATION> Heidelberg </LOCATION>, I was dog tired. More bad luck. <LOCATION> Heidelberg </LOCATION> was having a polio epidemic that summer. Polio takes about 10 days to incubate. Ten days after <LOCATION> Heidelberg </LOCATION> we were on a small ocean liner heading home. After a day of deck tennis and a night in the ship's pub, I woke on the morrow with, not unexpectedly, a splitting headache, stiff muscles and an uncertain stomach. Unable to handle lunch, I went back to our cabin to lie down in my upper bunk -LRB- tails again -RRB-. Several hours later I awoke and reached for the bunk light with my left arm. The shoulder did n't move and has n't since. Self-diagnosis was easy: polio. The legs still worked, so I set off for the sick bay. Polio, once it surfaces, moves swiftly. There are no wonder drugs for it. Bulbar polio, which strikes towards the brain, can kill in hours. Non-bulbar victims lie helplessly as random muscles about the body cease to function, sometimes forever. The frustration is as great as the fear. Two days after I was playing deck tennis, I could n't turn over in my bunk in the ship's surgery. A few hours after that I could only wiggle my finger and my toes. My breathing was becoming labored. A classic progression.

 The only oxygen was in possession of the ship's welding department. It was rigged with a hose and a glass funnel to improvise an oxygen tent. It helped a little. I fell into a fitful dream. I was running down a large cavern with no end. In the middle ground I saw another running figure who was also myself. I later learned that a number of people who have skirted death have had similar dreams. The case became something of a natural media event for those pre-Salk years: youth stricken with polio in <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION>. The victim's companion, a hero of the piece, persuaded the ship's command that some treatment might be used other than a stiff upper lip <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was radioed and a polio specialist was flown to <LOCATION> Halifax </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION>. From there the doctor boarded a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter to rendezvous with the ship in mid-ocean where a hurricane was blowing itself out. He brought a portable breathing machine with him but did n't use it. The polio, again by whim, had gone as far as it was going to go. He surveyed his patient and said simply: `` You'll walk again.'' On landing I was taken to a hospital in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that had turned over a whole ward to victims of that summer's epidemic. My room had three other patients, one a 33-year-old salesman in an iron lung. A 7-year-old boy in a lung was across the hall. Next door was a woman doubly afflicted. She had polio and she was also unmarried and pregnant. Up the hall was a sadistic teen-ager who tormented a roommate, who could only move his hands but not his arms or legs, by putting comic books just out of his reach. A vigilante duo, one with legs and the other with arms, combined to push-drag an idle litter up the hall to stop the barbarity. It was a case in point. Polio has no morals. The tormentor, who had been brought in an iron lung, walked out paralysis-free seven weeks later, having done nothing to help his rehabilitation but whine. Others courageously worked on what muscles that remained to them for months on end and got nowhere. Polio has one forgiving aspect. Paralysis is at its maximum in the first few days during the acute phase. From there on there is return of muscle, sometimes much, sometimes too little. This does leave room for hope. The disease is an anatomy professor. Patients learn the names of muscles they may no longer have. Biceps: the arms flexer. Triceps: the arm straightener. Leg adductors. Pronaters. Supraspinatus. Knowing what muscle does or did what helps the patient weigh his future. No biceps? Trying to hold a plate in buffet line may be an invitation to broken crockery. Weak triceps? Pushing a heavy revolving door wo n't be easy. No adductors? Say goodbye to skiing. The patient, as the deep and constant pain of muscle spasms gradually subsides and twinges of motion return, can begin to think of a longer future. This is not easy to visualize when trying to read a newspaper flat on your back with only wriggling fingers. It leaves you blanketed with pages like all the shrouds fit to print. But eventually there comes time to make a survey: Will you ever be able to feed yourself? Open a door? Walk outside? Hold a job? Marry and have children? Will you drown in self-pity or challenge the world from a wheelchair? Polio can be rather instructive in the area of self-knowledge. But it is the little things that are the first hurdles. Building up enough finger strength to twist a radio dial `` on''. Enough biceps to lift a fork. There is the rage of hopeless frustration in trying to tie a bow tie. The newspapers have said that Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who lost the use of an arm from a war wound, takes 10 minutes to button his shirt. They say he has an angry streak in him. A polio survivor can understand. Gradually as movement returns _ no more predictable than it went away _ the survivor learns new tricks. A bow tie can be tied if the bad arm is braced against a door jamb. Revolving doors can be mastered by waiting for someone to enter first and do most of the shoving. The person in leg braces learns which steps in a friend's house to avoid Learns to swallow pride and accept a piggyback. If the muscles are weak, the determination for the polio survivor seems to be as strong in inverse proportion. The salesman in the iron lung in the hospital in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> eventually managed another hospital from a wheelchair. After some months, I did walk again, just as predicted. My last pre-polio round of golf had been 101. My first post-polio was 102. I had lost one stroke and a number of scattered muscles. The other day I tried to lift a box of heavy bolts off the top shelf of a ship chandlery. The weakened triceps and the absent deltoids were n't up to it, and the whole load cascaded over my head onto the floor. Well, polios from those pre-vaccine days of 30, 40 and 50 years ago have learned if nothing else to be philosophical about the world their limitations have left for them. That's why post-polio muscular atrophy after all those decades of learning to cope seem to be a particularly cruel twist of the knife. I do n't know if it's happening to me, but I've already taken a night train to <LOCATION> Heidelberg </LOCATION>. I do n't want to have to go again.

 Colonial cottages on spacious grounds and lovely scenery greeted <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> when she arrived in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. A matronly woman held out her arms and said, `` Come on in, sweetie.'' Come on in, that was, to serve your 30-year sentence in the place to be if you're in that kind of a jam. For this was <PERSON> Liz </PERSON>'s welcome to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at <PERSON> Alderson </PERSON>, the federal government's only all-women's prison Here, where the <LOCATION> Greenbrier </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> winds among rolling hills, the affluent come to take mineral waters, and farmers bring livestock to market, <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> curls up on the bed in her tiny private room. There's a fluffy pink rug. Bits of beads and ribbons are draped around the mirror. Snapshots are pinned to the wall, reminders of the daughters <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> left behind in far-off <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Neither <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> nor the prison will specify her offense. `` In this place,'' says <PERSON> Liz </PERSON>, `` you can forget.'' Not entirely. `` This is a prison,'' says <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Gump </PERSON>, a pacifist who took a sledgehammer to a missile silo and must spend eight years away from her 12 children. The head counts, homosexuality, contraband, snitching, inspections, guards, isolation, lack of privacy, lack of control all are typical of prison life. Added to that are the absent children. A social worker says about 80 percent of the women at <PERSON> Alderson </PERSON> are mothers. `` What happens to the children, the families of the women here, is devastating,'' <PERSON> Gump </PERSON> says. Things go wrong at home. The children get into trouble. They go to jail. Their mothers sit helpless in prison, cut off by the same mountains that make the view so pretty. `` It is so heartbreaking,'' another inmate says. `` Everyone in the visiting room starts crying. It must be the most intense torture there is _ the intense pain of being emotionally helpless.'' <PERSON> Liz </PERSON>'s daughters are growing into strangers. She copes, she says, by not thinking about it. `` You ca n't be a mother. You try to be a friend,'' says <PERSON> Dora </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, serving life for murder. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s husband ran off with a younger woman and left her three sons to fend for themselves. They lasted a month before they got into trouble and two were made wards of the state. She has seen them twice in the past year. Sometimes there is sisterhood. `` You'll see it in people that you think, ` My God, they're so violent, they're so cold, they're so everything.' All of a sudden this one woman is going to have a need and then the goofy one you think is so nuts responds,'' <PERSON> Gump </PERSON> says. `` It is so good. It is just so good. You ca n't count on it, but it manifests itself.'' But mostly the women shut their turmoil inside. If they did n't, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> says, `` it would be a mess around here.'' Easygoing as life is in <LOCATION> Alderson </LOCATION>, compared with other prisons, temptation to escape remains. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Manson </PERSON> disciple <PERSON> Lynette </PERSON> `` Squeaky'' <PERSON> Fromme </PERSON> escaped last Christmas, when she thought her cult guru, also in prison, had cancer and `` I just had to get out.'' She was captured after three days. <PERSON> Fromme </PERSON> was sentenced in an assassination attempt on then-President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>. Another inmate fled in the winter of 1984 to reach the bedside of her ailing father. Her frozen body was found in an abandoned feed store about a mile from the prison six weeks later. <PERSON> Alderson </PERSON>'s warden is <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Burkhart </PERSON>. At some federal prisons, he says, you can cut the tension with a knife. `` Here, the tone is more relaxed,'' he says. `` I do n't want it to be tense.'' He's speaking in his office on a humid, 90-degree day, hotter inside. The warden has his tie knotted, his suit coat on and the air conditioner off. He looks comfortable. <PERSON> Burkhart </PERSON> plays it cool. Eighteen prisoners escaped the year he arrived, 1984; five fled last year and only one so far this year. `` Our first wall is our staff,'' he says. `` Friendly but not familiar.'' More relaxed inmates means fewer escapes. When nuclear disarmament radical <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodson </PERSON> tried to `` escape'' in March, she hung an `` end war'' banner on the prison fence, walked through the outer gate and poured white paint on the parking lot. Guards marched her back in. The warden stayed calm. `` She said, ` I escaped, did n't I?' And I said, ` No, you did n't,''' <PERSON> Burkhart </PERSON> says.

 Security at <PERSON> Alderson </PERSON> is not oppressive. On the grounds, maximum security murderers, some holding hands, are chatting with minimum-security embezzlers beneath majestic oaks. The only gun visible is one carried by a guard who patrols the 159-acre penitentiary's perimeter, walking along a chain-link fence that does n't always keep neighborhood dogs out. Beyond, however, are the mountains and miles and miles of woods, which make a stroll to freedom much less inviting. The isolation that keeps prisoners in also keeps their families out. `` The remoteness is a real barrier,'' says <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vodicka </PERSON>, who with his wife runs a hospitality house for what few inmate relatives make the journey to this rural corner of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Greenbrier </LOCATION>, Summers and <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> counties meet. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> pulls through <PERSON> Alderson </PERSON>, about a mile down the road from the prison, three times a week. A van brings families from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, twice a month. The only other way is by car. Last Thanksgiving, <PERSON> Vodicka </PERSON> says, only some 65 of the 812 inmates received visitors. The geographic isolation grates. <PERSON> Alderson </PERSON>'s inmate population is 45 percent black and 24 percent Hispanic. More than 150 inmates are Colombians, and many of the women do n't speak English. Most are from big cities. Their relatives often find the <PERSON> Alderson </PERSON> environment _ rural and 95 percent white _ puzzling. It's a tolerant town, however, one of those rare communities that actually wanted the prison to be built there and donated land for it. `` I've been really impressed with how friendly <PERSON> Alderson </PERSON> is,'' say <PERSON> Vodicka </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Dee </PERSON>. Inmates, in fact, march in <PERSON> Alderson </PERSON>'s holiday parade. They provide fire protection, too; the prison runs the nation's only all-female firefighting force. Competition is keen among inmates for the tough training required, in part because they then live in a cottage set aside for the firefighters and emergency medical technicians. The women take special delight in telling about the time they arrived at the scene of a car accident and treated the injured child of a prison guard. In this rather unusual coexistence, town folk do n't worry when the prison whistle sounds an occasional escape alert. `` You just about expect it,'' says a waitress at the <ORGANIZATION> Alderson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livestock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION>'s coffee bar. `` Mostly I never think about it. If it were men, you'd think of more hardened criminals. If a man escapes, you have to watch for it. But women ...'' Among the better-known prisoners at <LOCATION> Alderson </LOCATION> have been <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Rose and Axis <PERSON> Sally </PERSON>, serving time for their World War II activities in behalf of the nation's enemies. Singer Billie Holiday was there once on a drug conviction. No prison is wholly trouble free. In 1979, inmates complained of mistreatment by guards and inadequate health care. One woman told a civil rights task force that prison doctors did n't discover her pregnancy until she gave birth to twins, one alive and one stillborn. In 1982, Haitian refugees _ held there while the federal government tried to figure out what to do with them _ waged a hunger strike and two were force-fed. Lesbianism is said to be widespread, but as one former warden noted, `` Homosexuality in a women's institution does n't take the same -LRB- violent -RRB- form it often does in a male facility.'' <PERSON> Alderson </PERSON> was unusual from its beginnings in 1927. Inmates in white gloves served tea and presented plays under the first warden, Superintendent <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, who once taught Latin at a girl's finishing school in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> In typical style she posed for her warden's portrait in pearls, fur stole and white, elbow-high gloves. When the modern <PERSON> Alderson </PERSON> staged a show in 1981, it appeared on TV's `` The Games People Play,'' with inmates and staff competing over an obstacle course and criminal lawyer <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> serving as the commentator. Despite <PERSON> Alderson </PERSON>'s relative sedateness, there are violent prisoners there, and for such hard-core inmates the end of life there is approaching. The <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> is creating a second all-women penitentiary in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, where violent-prone offenders will be housed in an underground complex. <PERSON> Alderson </PERSON> will be converted to a `` camp.'' Inmates at <PERSON> Alderson </PERSON> hate the idea of being transferred to another prison, which is a considerable incentive for good behavior. Says <PERSON> Liz </PERSON>, the 30-year termer: `` If they write a how-to book on prison, the first thing it should say is, ` If you have to go to jail, ask for <PERSON> Alderson </PERSON>.'''

 The crowd's five deep at the petting zoo and just parking the car requires patience, skill and help from a guy in a sheriff's uniform directing bumper-to-bumper traffic around a huge lot. Inside, robot dogs sing mournfully of lost love and <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Milk </PERSON>, spokescarton for `` The Farm Fresh Five,'' an animated quintet of dairy products, plays to a packed house. College kids in cow costumes cavort between shows and helium balloons float through popcorn-scented air. It's not a theme park, it's `` The Disneyland of Dairy Stores,'' as Rich Milk puts it. Should that description stay with you, owner <PERSON> Stew </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> wo n't mind a bit. `` Disney's my hero,'' he says. `` The Different Dairy'' is another catch-phrase, and proof of that can be found on the bottom line: <ORGANIZATION> Stew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leonard </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dairy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION> sells $ 100 million worth of food a year, more per square foot than any other grocery. This despite an inventory of 700 items _ a typical supermarket carries 24,000 _ and the presence of 93 other markets within 15 miles of that clogged parking lot. Each year, 500,000 pounds of butter, 10 million quarts of milk and 500 tons of salads pass his computerized checkouts; in a typical week, 100,000 pounds of his buddy <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Perdue </PERSON>'s chickens fly off the shelves. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> focuses on customers; 100,000 troop through every week, and his mission's to see that they walk out happy. To do that, he gives them what they want the way they want it. Choosy about berries? He'll put them out loose. Prefer fish on ice instead of on Styrofoam? He'll build a fish bar. The responsiveness works both ways. Stew's customers stuff his suggestion box with more than 100 comments a day, and some come in on Sundays to put in their two cents in person, at monthly meetings with management. A vacationing shopper homesick for the store sent a snapshot of herself holding a <PERSON> Stew </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>'s bag in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Red Square. Stew tacked it up. He's since received 7,000 pictures of customers and bags at such spots as the Taj Mahal and the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sphinx </LOCATION>. His favorite: an underwater shot of skin divers holding their bag beneath the <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> Triangle. The store's `` a mini-carnival'' to customer <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, who says taking her two preschoolers `` can take the edge off a very bad day.'' The large sales and loyal following, combined with a cheerleading management style that stresses teamwork, advancement and fun, have made <PERSON> Stew </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> a small-business superstar. He's in a dozen books -LRB- <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>' `` A Passion for Excellence'' mentions him 22 times -RRB- and numerous marketing and management training videos. He's the star of a <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnegie </PERSON> ad campaign. And recently, he was one of 11 business people honored by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>'s advice to the next generation of corporate Americans, already dissecting his methods in business schools across the land: `` Do n't go into business to get rich. Do it to enrich people. It will come back to you. `` Big business always makes it sound so complicated,'' he adds. `` You do n't have to reinvent the wheel. You just have to care.'' Like friend and neighbor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, whose salad dressing he helped launch, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> has now tasted fame. Unlike the actor, who `` puts his coat over his head when he goes out to dinner,'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> is eating it up. `` I can hardly believe it,'' says the silver-haired, bespectacled grocer. `` To be the hero in your own thing, that's the dream of every entrepreneur.''

 The philosophy that got him here is literally chiseled in stone outside the dairy, a rambling gray building that resembles a barn. A three-ton hunk of granite at the entrance reads: `` Rule 1 _ The customer is always right. `` Rule 2 _ If the customer is ever wrong, re-read Rule 1.'' Skeptics need only hang around the customer service counter where cheerful employees soothe the disgruntled. Recently, they included a woman complaining of stale coffee beans. When had she bought them? `` Two years ago.'' She got a refund, as did the shopper who returned her Christmas tree in March. It had dried out. Not long ago, a woman asked for _ and got _ a refund for 20 pounds of shrimp. Later, a worker discovered she'd never paid for them. `` My hardest job is not to catch her, but to keep those people on the customer service desk from developing a bad attitude,'' says <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, who thinks `` 999 people out of a thousand are honest.'' `` I know I've got to get cheated once in awhile, but do n't tell me about it. Do n't shade my thinking.'' `` I grew up in <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, so I feel like it's part of me,'' says employee <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lung </PERSON>, who works on `` Stew's News,'' a sort of `` People'' magazine for employees that a business magazine calls `` the ultimate company newsletter.'' `` I had no art degree, but four years ago, he gave me a chance. I'm glad _ it's a special place to work.'' Among other fringe benefits, Lung says, his employer has paid for art classes and seminars at <ORGANIZATION> Bridgeport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Some kids dream of becoming movie stars. <PERSON> Stew </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> dreamed of being a milkman. The youngest of seven, he'd get up at 4 a.m. for the thrill of riding along on his father's <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION> milk route. His father died four months after <PERSON> Stew </PERSON> graduated from college. He took over the business, got married, had four children. Then, in 1968, the state built a highway through his dairy. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> gambled he could get customers to make a special trip for milk by building a store around a dairy. He was 38 years old. He remortgaged his house, dipped into his kids' college fund and borrowed $ 482,500 from the <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, a record amount at the time. From the beginning, the store was different. Instead of many narrow aisles, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> built one wide labyrinth that brings customers face-to-face with the entire inventory. In 1969, the year he opened, it consisted of seven items. Since then, he's added on 27 times. The store now features a $ 1 million kitchen that turns out 200 salads and hot entrees daily, a barbecue department and a seasonal garden shop that pops up with the crocuses. The milk-processing plant, which pasteurizes and packages 5 million half-gallons of milk and 1 -LCB- half-gallons of orange juice annually, is glassed-in so customers can watch cartons whiz by at 150 per minute. Stew's children have all joined the business. A firm believer in nepotism, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> has 22 relatives in the store. Half his 600 employees have relatives here too. `` It's very good for the culture of a company,'' he says. In spare moments, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> works on his design for the new and improved <PERSON> Stew </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>'s, set to open in <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION> in two years. He says it'll be similar to <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, only bigger. And this time, the cows will be real.

 WATER VALLEY, Miss. _ The 20th century was not quite four months old when railroad engineer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> `` Casey'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> crashed the Cannon Ball Express into a freight train at <LOCATION> Vaughan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, and became an American folk hero. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurner </PERSON> had not been born then, but you'd never guess it listening to him talk, sitting under a shade tree in his front yard on the edge of town, thumbs tucked under the bib of his overalls, a railroader's cap on his head. `` <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> was a good engineer,'' he was saying. `` <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> would have made a good jet pilot. He was a bit of a chance-taker, but he got caught in a trap that was not of his own making. `` If <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> had n't of gotten killed, he would have died of a broken heart, because he sure would have gotten fired for what happened. Railroading was his first love. Even his wife <PERSON> Janie </PERSON> _ she was the cutest thing _ came in second to railroading.'' <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurner </PERSON>, 68, former schoolteacher and railroad engineer, historian and photographer, fisherman, curator of his own backyard museum of railroad memorabilia, chronicler of the last ride of <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. Retired 10 years ago, after losing the sight in his left eye, <PERSON> Gurner </PERSON> spends much of his time these days in his canoe out on <PERSON> Enid </PERSON> <PERSON> Reservoir </PERSON>, running trotlines in quest of crappie and catfish. `` I tried to be a commercial fisherman for a while after I retired, but I found out that when you do it regular it's not as much fun,'' he says. `` No telling where I would have gone if I had n't been kind of lazy.'' For 40 years or so he had alternated between two careers, railroading and teaching in high school. He was also shooting pictures for the local weekly newspaper and working with the <ORGANIZATION> Yalobusha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, while raising five sons and a daughter. Among his fondest memories are working on the City of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, like his father and his uncles. That's the passenger train that splits the heartland on its 920-mile run from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and was made famous by <PERSON> Arlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>'s hit folk song in 1972. `` When I quit teaching at <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> I put in two years on that beautiful City of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> firing -LRB- working as a fireman -RRB- for Cap Gardner. Boy, was that high living. Making twice as much money as I was teaching. Eight days a month off.'' If you want to listen, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurner </PERSON> can talk to you for hours about highballing up and down the Illinois Central tracks from <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, and the golden era of steam locomotives, in the days when <LOCATION> Water </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> was a railroad town, with a big roundhouse and shop, and people like <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> lived there.

 `` It took me 25 years to figure out what happened to him down there at <LOCATION> Vaughan </LOCATION>,'' says <PERSON> Gurner </PERSON>, who collected rare photographs and old railroad records and the recollections of <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' widow and the old-timers who had ridden with him. `` Thing is, nothing would have ever come of it except that an engine wiper in the <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> shop, who was an old friend of <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>'s, wrote that ballad about it and some vaudeville performers picked it up. `` Engineers were getting killed all the time in those days of heavy traffic on single-track railroads, when slow freights had to be sidetracked to make way for the passenger trains. Sometimes they did n't even get their names in the paper when they got killed, but <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> had a song written about him and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> had a new folk hero.'' At 12:50 a.m. on the morning of April 30, 1900 <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> pulled out of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>' Poplar Street Station at the throttle of the <ORGANIZATION> Cannon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, with <PERSON> Sim </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> as his fireman and <PERSON> J.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> the conductor. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> was leaving an hour and 35 minutes late and wanted to make up the time before he reached <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>.

 In an self-published account of <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' last ride, <PERSON> Gurner </PERSON>, who has made that same run many times, described how <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> had probably made up that lost time. `` Passenger comfort was not too important in those days and damage suits for being thrown about at high rates of speed almost unheard of,'' <PERSON> Gurner </PERSON> says. The Cannon Ball was on time when it reached <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Vaughan </LOCATION>, but disaster awaited down the tracks. To make way for the passenger train, two long freights, one headed north and one headed south, were switched off to a siding on the East side of the main line, but the caboose and three cars of the southbound train were still protruding onto the main line. <PERSON> Sim </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> the fireman first saw the caboose, shouted, and jumped to safety. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> hit the emergency brakes but stayed with his engine as it crashed into the rear cars of the freight and lunged to the left, coming to rest pointing in the direction it came. A bolt or a splinter of lumber pierced <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> in the throat. He was taken on a stretcher to the depot a half-mile away, where he died lying on a baggage wagon. In addition to <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, three passengers, an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> messenger, and two postal clerks were slightly injured.

<TEXT>
 `` All the crew safe, you say, and the passengers too? `` Thank God, that is clever, `` And his soft eyes closed as his pale face smiled `` And he whistled down brakes forever.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 What went wrong? <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said later he saw a flagman and heard the torpedoes, explosive devices placed on the tracks to warn the engineer, but <PERSON> Gurner </PERSON> contends <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> was `` short-flagged.'' `` The flagman did n't get far enough back for <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> so see him in time to stop,'' he says. Nonetheless, the railroad's investigation concluded that, `` Engineer <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> was solely responsible for the accident as a consequence of not having responded to flag signals.'' According to railroad records, the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> awarded <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> $ 5 for his injuries. The messenger, who hurt his back, got $ 23, and the two postal clerks $ 1 each. Why did n't <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> jump? `` That is really the hard one to answer,'' <PERSON> Gurner </PERSON> says. `` Once the engineer puts the brake in emergency, reverses the engine and opens the sanders, the engine has no further need of his services.'' Even though <PERSON> Gurner </PERSON> insists <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> was a `` fine engineer,'' he found railroad records that showed <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> had been suspended nine times, for periods ranging from 5 days to 30 days, for safety violations between Feb. 14, 1891 and May 22, 1899. The offenses included such things as `` collision in <LOCATION> Water </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yard </LOCATION>,'' `` running through switch at <LOCATION> Carbondale </LOCATION>,'' `` for not recognizing flagman who was protecting work train.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> lived in <LOCATION> Water </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> from 1893 to 1896. He moved his wife and three sons back to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, at his wife's insistence, but he retained his membership in the Water Valley lodge of the <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Locomotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>. Today there are <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> museums at <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> and at <LOCATION> Vaughan </LOCATION>, where much of <PERSON> Gurner </PERSON>'s memorabilia is on display <PERSON> Gurner </PERSON>, being from a family of railroaders, got interested in railroad history and began taking pictures as a boy. In 1940 he signed on as a machinist's apprentice at the Illinois Central shop in <LOCATION> Paducah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, where the Water Valley shop had been transplanted. He got to know men like <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, a retired engineer, and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, a retired shop man, who had known <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> well. `` When they tore the old <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> depot </ORGANIZATION> down, I got this wealth of old records that were being hauled off to the garbage dump,'' <PERSON> Gurner </PERSON> says. But the railroad in Water Valley today is only a memory. `` They ran the last train in February of'82,'' <PERSON> Gurner </PERSON> says. `` They even took up the tracks. That was adding insult to injury.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ It's the largest walrus hauling ground in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, an island off southwest <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> that each summer attracts thousands of the 2-ton mammals with their long tusks. But the numbers of walruses on <LOCATION> Round </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> have been dwindling in recent years, from a peak of 15,000 in the mid-1970s to about 4,500 this summer. State biologists blame the noise.

<TEXT>
 Noisy sight-seers and fishermen intruding on the walruses of <LOCATION> Round </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> may be causing the blubbery beasts to defect to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> where they enjoy more privacy. Each summer, thousands of bull walruses haul out on the huge rocks that ring the shore of this mist-enshrouded island 13 miles off southwest <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. The puffing, snorting, hissing mammals ponderously heave their 2 tons of bulk from the frigid waters of the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and shoulder and poke their way with their huge ivory tusks into the overlapping mass of their thick-skinned brethren. Each is seeking a place in the sun, a spot to rest between seven - to 10-day feeding frenzies From a distance, they look like layers of cinnamon-colored fringe stitched to the base of the cliffs. Up close, they look more like bewhiskered bachelors sleeping off the effects of a boozy beach party _ eyes closed, heads down, their bodies oozing into crevices in the rocks. While the males are piled up on beaches as far south as <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yakutat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, the females and their young remain with the pack ice north of the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> and into the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. But the number of <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> walruses that haul out here and in lesser numbers at the other six islands of the <LOCATION> Walrus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> State Game Sanctuary have started to decline again, after a spectacular comeback that peaked in the 1970s. On <LOCATION> Round </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> they have enjoyed considerable privacy in the past, largely because of the weather and location. The nearest community is <LOCATION> Togiak </LOCATION>, some 33 miles by charter boat to the northeast. Summertime weather is characterized by wind, rain and high waves that make approach by floatplane or small boat hazardous if not impossible. But with increased commercial bottom-fishing activity and the prospect of oil exploration and development in salmon-rich <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, all that isolation may come to an end. And that has some professional walrus watchers concerned. `` Walruses are pretty sensitive to disturbance,'' says <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON>, a marine mammal specialist with the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> and Game in Fairbanks. `` There's more than a little concern that the noise caused by the fishery has adversely influenced the haul-out. People on the island say they sometimes can hear the radios on the bridges of the boats.'' <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, another state biologist, monitors walrus numbers from his office in <LOCATION> Dillingham </LOCATION>. `` In the mid-1970s, we had as many as 15,000 animals there,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> says. `` It was 4,400 last year and about 4,500 now. The difficult thing is there are so many reasons for the numbers to go up and down. `` To my mind, the sheer number of boats out there with motors droning in the water sets up an acoustical noise that may be a cause.'' The two game technicians on Round Island this summer, <PERSON> Polly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hessing </PERSON> and <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON>, say they counted as many as 180 boats in the area during a peak fishing period this spring. Although the vessels were outside the two-mile limit established around the sanctuary, the noise they made was loud enough to force the women to close the windows in their cabin so they could get some sleep. The state set up the sanctuary in 1960 to protect the last remaining walrus hauling grounds in the south <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. Thirty permits a day _ half for overnight and half for day use _ are available for people wishing to visit the island. Access, however, is restricted to a narrow corridor fronting a grassy campground. New arrivals are asked to anchor offshore until the technicians can pick them up in their small, inflatable raft. Although walruses get top billing, the treeless island also supports nearly 450,000 sea birds, primarily common murres, black-legged kittiwakes, cormorants, parakeet auklets, horned and tufted puffins and gulls. Red fox on the island are unafraid of people and often share trails with campers. Hundreds of sea lions provide a change in the soundtrack on the island's southern beaches, and a showy mix of wildflowers anchors the thin soil on its talus-covered slopes. No one seems to know much about the dynamics of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> walrus herd. It's believed to comprise some 234,000 animals, back to its 18th century levels before commercial harvesting severely depleted its numbers. `` We have a lot of broad-scale information, but little in the way of specifics about haul-outs and food,'' <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> says. `` We know the population is large; we do n't know its bounds. <PERSON> Walrus </PERSON> came back from virtually no animals in the'40s, to peak counts in the late'70s.'' The population on Round Island dipped as low as 3,000 in 1983. Changes in the climate, variations in the food chain, the growing volume of noise and other human disturbances are being blamed for what appears to be a downward trend. `` Two years does not a trend make, but we are becoming concerned,'' <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> says. `` Walrus are fairly traditional about where they haul out. So are sea lions. But there are several other places they could go and we do n't know if the herd is simply splitting up or what it's doing.'' The two-mile buffer and surveillance by fish and game personnel stationed there from May to September of each year is credited with limiting some of the human disturbance, such as illegal hunting, spotter planes from the herring fishery buzzing the island and boats coming too close. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> says the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is more protective of its walrus herd. `` On the Soviet coast, aircraft are held to 10,000-foot minimums and boats restricted to 16 miles,'' he says. `` It may be because of those more severe restrictions that more <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> walruses are hauling out there.'' Officials are considering tightening regulations governing at least the fishery near <LOCATION> Round </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` This is a unique place, the largest hauling ground in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> says. `` It would be a shame to lose it.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ The baroque <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION>, designed by Sir <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Wren </PERSON>, is a beloved national monument in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. It is also at the center of a heated debate over modern architecture, since developers have a plan to rebuild much of the neighborhood near the cathedral.

 <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s best-known critic of modern building, has put architects on the line in the one place they can not afford to blunder: opposite St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s Cathedral. The domed cathedral in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, burial place of the nation's heroes, survivor of the Nazi blitz, is now the focal point of a heated debate about how cities should preserve their heritage while coping with modern needs The debate is symptomatic of a dilemma confronting all historic cities. In the words of architecture professor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Jencks </PERSON>, `` In most cities of the West there is a genteel blood bath going on among those who have different tastes.'' Nowhere is that battle more intense than at Paternoster Square facing the north side of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. Developer <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Clegg </PERSON>, who owns most of the 7-acre site, plans to tear down a clump of undistinguished 1960s office blocks and put up more offices and shops. But Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, who got married in <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, hates <PERSON> Clegg </PERSON>'s plan Although he has no architectural background, he has made the subject one of his favorite hobbyhorses, and his opinions carry weight. The baroque cathedral designed by Sir <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Wren </PERSON> is a beloved national monument. So the developers consulted with the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and other interested bodies, and invited seven architects to compete for the development. They also invited the heir to the throne to see the plans. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> disliked them all, telling a banquet in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> financial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> district </LOCATION> last December: `` I was deeply depressed that none of them had risen to the occasion.'' `` Surely here, if anywhere, was the time and place to sacrifice some profit, if need be, for generosity of vision, elegance and dignity, for buildings which would raise our spirits and our faith in commercial enterprise and prove that capitalism can have a human face,'' the prince said. He likened much of the rebuilding of British cities since World War II to a rape, and in his most controversial utterance, suggested that modern <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> architecture was more unsightly than the rubble left by the German bombers. <PERSON> Clegg </PERSON> conceded in an interview that `` there's been a lot of criticism'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Arup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> plan which his <ORGANIZATION> Mountleigh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> chose. But he added that tastes change, noting that the existing plaza and buildings, now despised, were much admired when they went up in the 1960s, It is the prince's view that architecture should put people first. `` Hurrah for the champion of ordinary people ... Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> is acting as the conscience of the nation,'' wrote architecture critic <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON> <PERSON> Stamp </PERSON> in The Daily Telegraph. The concrete shopping centers, dull office blocks and high-rise public housing that typify many British cities were built hastily to replace war rubble and solve the postwar housing shortage. Now, many are so hated that they are being dynamited by city authorities. Today, many inner-city housing complexes consist of cottages and gardens that mesh well with <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>' small-is-beautiful philosophy In <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> last March, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> told a conference of international architects that after 40 years of town-planning in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, `` the results have been pretty disastrous.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> went public on architecture in 1984, and has developed his theme with mounting fervor, claiming to speak for ordinary people whose views are ignored by the professionals. Although self-appointed as an arbiter of taste, 39-year-old <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> is one of the most popular members of the royal fmily, and his views get results. A projected extension to the National Gallery art museum in <LOCATION> Trafalgar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> was shelved after he called it a `` monstrous carbuncle on the face of a well-loved friend.'' Then he dismissed a 20-story tower design of the late <PERSON> Mies </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohe </PERSON>, for a site near the Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, as a `` giant glass stump.'' It too was scrapped. This year his written complaint about apartment blocks planned near his <LOCATION> Kensington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION> residence led to their alteration. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> likes classical style buildings recalling 18th century Georgian architecture, itself inspired by ancient <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. He prefers buildings on a human scale with ground-level shops and somewhere to sit down. Many architects are aggrieved at being attacked by a man who has no formal architectural training. A Paternoster plan which the prince favors _ <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>'s arcaded shops and low-level main buildings with columned facades and sculpture _ has met a lukewarm response. Architect <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON>, tapped as the next president of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Architects </ORGANIZATION>, accuses the prince of abusing his privileged position. Writing in The Independent newspaper, <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON> denounced the `` fogeyish obsession'' with classical styles and wondered why the work of contemporary British architects such as <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, who co-designed the futuristic pipes-and-glass <LOCATION> Pompidou </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Center </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, is more admired abroad than at home. But <PERSON> Jencks </PERSON>, writing in The Observer weekly, remarked that most people now preferred `` to live in traditional houses at a village level, and possibly in some other century.'' <PERSON> Jencks </PERSON> also told a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> audience that <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> had played a crucial role in widening the debate. `` We are closer now than we have been for 70 years to welcoming different schools and philosophies of architecture,'' he said. <PERSON> Wren </PERSON> also had problems. His first two designs for a replacement of the medieval cathedral, destroyed in the Great Fire of 1666, were rejected. His cathedral, which attracts 3 million visitors a year, has become a tough act for any architect to follow. Asked if he was worried by all the publicity, <PERSON> Clegg </PERSON>, 51, said: `` I think anything worthwhile is going to involve a whole lot of argument and it will be worth it. Even without <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, lots of people would have taken a strong interest in this site.'' <PERSON> Clegg </PERSON> estimates his development will cost $ 700 million to $ 850 million. He says he will apply for planning permission in December, start building in 1990 and hopes to complete the job by 1993. The rival plans were displayed for four weeks in the crypt of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> and attracted 7,000 visitors, 700 of whom left written comments which the developers say will be considered in the final plan.

 The people who will take `` Discover: the World of Science'' into its fourth PBS season tend to think of the series as a kind of curiosity shop. Little ideas that the imagination can pick up and handle. The show for the most part leaves the panoramic views to `` Nova'' and other ambitious programs that try to bring science to the public. `` A lot of people make the mistake of imagining that science is too tough for them to get,'' says <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Angier </PERSON>, one of the two executive producers of the science program hosted by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Graves </PERSON>. `` Anybody can get science. It's about the world and how the world works. To watch ` Discover,' there is no need to know any science. We always make sure whatever background you need is right in the story. `` We emphasize human interest. We do a medical story through the eyes and experience of an individual. We follow the progress of a patient over a long period of time.'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Chedd </PERSON>, <PERSON> Angier </PERSON>'s partner, says, `` People tend to think of scientists as dull, boring or whacked out. There are crazies out there. There also are articulate, interesting people doing weird and wonderful things. All they want to do is find out about something or other. We're one of the few places they can consistently tell their stories on TV.'' Chedd continues, `` I do n't want to knock ` Nova' but they only get to do 10 or 12 new productions a year. They have to pick big subjects. We turn out 20 to 25 new stories; we can pick little ones if we like.'' `` Discover'' has five shows in a season, monthly, starting in October. <PERSON> Angier </PERSON> studied physics and likes animal and aviation stories. Chedd, who studied biology, prefers space and medical stories. They make an eclectic team, poring over academic, scientific and medical research journals, fishing in deep waters for scientific game of all sizes. `` A sub-part of a story published in a journal may become our story,'' Chedd says. When they heard about some guy in western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> who was doing lightning research, they sent their people there, then west to a mountain in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> which has the most lightning in the country. While in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, one of them happened to run into people doing a dinosaur dig, looking for a 140-foot seismosaurus, another story lead for `` Discover.'' Chedd and <PERSON> Angier </PERSON>, both born in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, met through `` Nova,'' which <PERSON> Angier </PERSON> calls `` the granddaddy of science broadcasting in this country. `` I was one of the first producers on that. I came from the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> was our first science editor. He was doing something for the American Association for the <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and started advising us on science content.'' They formed <ORGANIZATION> Chedd-Angier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` We went along to the publisher of Discover magazine and suggested to him a TV companion and that we make it. To our amazement, he listened to us,'' <PERSON> Angier </PERSON> says. The TV show mentions the magazine and the magazine mentions the show, but stories in the two are different. `` Discover'' started life in 1981-82 as a commercial TV program to be syndicated. `` It was a fabulously expensive way of distributing,'' <PERSON> Angier </PERSON> says. `` That's why our series eventually moved to public television.'' Chedd says the audience for `` Discover'' has consistently grown. `` Independent production companies in the documentary field are usually a free-lance producer with an assistant,'' <PERSON> Angier </PERSON> says. `` We're relatively unusual in that we have 35 people working, including 10 to 15 producers. In Hollywood there are giants, but they're usually entertainment. As far as I know, there's no other company like ours.'' <PERSON> Chedd-Angier </PERSON> also does stories for `` Nova'' and science productions for corporations. They currently have in production 26 half-hour educational shows about statistics, at the first-year college level. <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION>, which is underwriting `` Discover'' for the fourth season, sends several million free teachers' guides and activity sheets to schools which use the show in science teaching. <PERSON> Chedd-Angier </PERSON> also is working on a 10-part series on the global environment and planning an eight-part series about molecular biology and genetic engineering, both with <ORGANIZATION> WGBH </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> for 1991. Both men still do some on-site producing for `` Discover.'' `` I was doing a story about the recovery of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Helens </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Angier </PERSON> says. `` It turns out one of the chief ways in which nature is rebuilding itself there is by means of gophers. They dig through the hard core of ash and bring soil to the surface and plants can grow in it. `` I said to a scientist working there, ` What we need is to get a shot of gophers digging. How on earth are we going to do this?' `` He said, ` They'll dig because they dig all the time.''' <PERSON> Angier </PERSON> pessimistically bet him a case of beer that the gophers would n't cooperate with the cameras. He discovered that one reason gophers are such good diggers is that they are always practicing. They got nothing for their `` Discover'' appearance, but the scientist got his beer. `` He was right. We got all the shots we wanted.''

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallowitch </PERSON> is a sophisticated sprite of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, an impish composer, pianist and cabaret performer who celebrates <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and chronicles its often bizarre customs and mores. He sings the music of <PERSON> Gershwin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kern </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> too, but he also performs his own compositions, usually songs about <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> filtered through the sensibilities of the 1960s,'70s and'80s. He can lament the loneliness of big-city life in `` I Live Alone Again,'' laugh at growing old in `` I'm 27,'' or luxuriate in the pleasures of high living in `` Back on the Town.'' The classically trained musician sings anywhere and with little coaxing: in his cluttered, score-strewn apartment, once the home of actress <ORGANIZATION> Katharine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION>; on his weekly cable television show; in tiny nightspots around town, or even on the street, where his yearly serenadings of <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> _ a <LOCATION> Beekman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Place </LOCATION> neighbor _ have attracted more and more media attention. The impeccable <PERSON> Wallowitch </PERSON>, who seems always to be dressed in white shirt and bow tie, has worked since 1984 with <PERSON> Bertram </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, once a leading dancer in <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s company. `` We have tons of material,'' says <PERSON> Wallowitch </PERSON>, a fanatic collector of old sheet music. `` Three separate evenings of theater songs, including one about <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. I could go through a year and not repeat one song _ which I have done.'' With <PERSON> Wallowitch </PERSON> providing piano accompaniment, <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> can launch into obscure <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> comic ditties like `` Cohen Owes Me 97 Dollars'' or `` Sadie Salome Go Home.'' <PERSON> Wallowitch </PERSON> can handle a tender, lush love song, `` Come A Little Closer,'' that he wrote himself. Or the duo can rip through virtually unknown songs from forgotten Broadway shows like <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s `` Chee-Chee.'' <PERSON> Wallowitch </PERSON>'s early world was n't anywhere near the bright lights of <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. He grew up in an isolated area of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, a neighborhood across from the city dump and surrounded by gas tanks of the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. His father owned a butcher shop Young <PERSON> John </PERSON>, the first of four children, was precocious, he admits. After all, how many youngsters sing `` Genevieve, Sweet Genevieve'' at the age of 3 months? In a few years, <PERSON> Wallowitch </PERSON> was picking out tunes on his grandmother's piano, and having poems published in a children's column of the local newspaper. ` I guess it was desperation,'' he recalls. `` When you are born in a neighborhood like that, you'd better do something.'' <PERSON> Wallowitch </PERSON> did. He took piano lessons. Every Wednesday, the <PERSON> Wallowitch </PERSON> family would listen to the <ORGANIZATION> Lithuanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Furniture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hour </ORGANIZATION>. Their eldest son, wearing knickers and anklets, made his piano debut on the program, playing a <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> song called `` So Help Me.'' <PERSON> Wallowitch </PERSON> eventually became a regular on the show, usually performing short classical pieces. His musical education continued at <ORGANIZATION> Edwin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where he would sneak into the building before classes to play a grand piano. He was caught one day by the school's music teacher. Instead of punishment, he got free lessons. He went to Temple to major in education so he could become a high school music teacher, but was drafted. `` I did n't know what I wanted to do with my life,'' <PERSON> Wallowitch </PERSON> says. `` But when I got into the Army something happened to me.'' Each night, he went to the USO to play the piano. `` I became violent about it,'' <PERSON> Wallowitch </PERSON> says. `` I would push people away from the piano and say, ` I play better than you.' I was terrible, but this was my life.'' While in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Wallowitch </PERSON> gave his first public performance in front of an audience, 10,000 people in a stadium in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. He was to play `` Clair de lune,'' but forgot part of the piece. `` I found myself talking over the microphone and pretending to be doing a comedy routine,'' he says. <PERSON> Wallowitch </PERSON>, the cabaret performer, was born to great applause, even if he was mortified about forgetting the notes. <PERSON> Wallowitch </PERSON> later returned to Temple and to his old high school piano teacher. He eventually was drawn to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to study music at Juilliard. He was there for eight years, even getting a post-graduate degree. `` To keep myself solvent, I played in tap-dancing schools and for small dance companies,'' he says. He also entered the theater, working as a rehearsal pianist for `` New Faces of'52,'' considered the best of the Broadway revues of the 1950s. `` I was so dumb. I thought I was going to be this great concert pianist,'' <PERSON> Wallowitch </PERSON> says. `` When you start to mix with show people and you start to realize you have a talent in that area, then you realize what it takes to be a concert artist and how few people really succeed at it. There's the loneliness of that life and the eight hours a day practicing.'' He finally made his concert debut in October 1962 at Carnegie Recital Hall, getting rave reviews. He toured <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, under <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sponsorship, with actress and singer <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrymore </PERSON> <PERSON> Colt </PERSON>. He accompanied her American theater songs, as well as doing his own program. Back in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, he landed a job at a small <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> nightclub. He played piano every night for six hours. He even attempted to sing. One night, an irate customer yelled, `` Do n't sing, we want to talk. The next night <PERSON> Wallowitch </PERSON> came back with an original composition, `` Who Needs Enemies When I Have a Friend Like You'' and his songwriting career began in earnest. Today, <PERSON> Wallowitch </PERSON> concentrates on performing, writing only occasionally. `` I can go on a writing jag because I have a lot of ideas,'' he says. `` I store them. I feel like <PERSON> Ibsen </PERSON>, you know. He would think about a thing for two years and then suddenly the whole thing falls out.''

 Eight professors and eight students have been shot to death in the past year, allegedly by right-wing death squads, in a campaign of terror aimed at halting left-wing activism at <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antioquia </ORGANIZATION>. It has succeeded. There has been a steady exodus of students since the killings began; 39 professors have resigned. Textbooks that might be thought to contain radical ideas have been removed. A great silence has fallen on a university that once prided itself on an outspoken faculty and student body. `` Having an opinion is a crime,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Clemencia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyos </PERSON>, a law professor. `` No one wants to talk now about social problems for fear of being killed.'' Violence had been frequent on the <LOCATION> Antioquia </LOCATION> campus, until two years ago when demonstrating students set fire to a car on campus. Two nuns happened to be in the randomly selected vehicle and they burned to death. The incident drew national attention and campus violence, which often included bombings by students, came to a halt. The incident also attracted the attention of death squads, according to professors interviewed. Death squads have been linked to the killing of more than 800 people in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in the last two years. So far not a single arrest has been made in any of the deaths. Vigilantes are common in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s small towns and rural areas where hooded men mete out justice frequently to cattle thieves and bandits. Except for a few isolated cases, vigilantes left universities alone. Then starting last year, the vigilante-style killings came to <LOCATION> Antioquia </LOCATION> _ the latest Aug. 6. All of the eight students slain were known radicals who made no secret of helping make bombs or setting them off, according to a half dozen university professors interviewed by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The eight professors killed had been active in demonstrations to get a university rector replaced or were outspoken in their classrooms when it came to criticizing government agencies, the interviewees said. Gunmen drove through the garage door at the home of one of the professors and shot him to death in front of his wife and children. Other victims were snatched off streets. Their bodies, with hands tied behind their backs and showing signs of torture, were found along highways outside of town. Each victim had been shot in the back of the head. Some had their fingernails pulled out. In the plaza of the 167-year-old university, students in the past customarily spoke out on a range of issues in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> _ alleged government corruption, illegal arrests, and poverty. <LOCATION> Antioquia </LOCATION> students have a historical reputation as being the most radical of any university in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. Attacks by students and professors on the country's political system had earned the university a reputation in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> as a hothouse of Marxists, leftist guerrillas and terrorists. One professor, asking to remain anonymous for reasons of personal safety, estimated that about 80 percent of the 16,000-member student body is leftist. Politics on campus range from anarchists and revolutionaries to those who would like to see a socialist government in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, but who are not violent. Before the killings, student orators were free to talk on any subject. A speech urging students to join <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s estimated 10,000 leftist guerrillas might have been followed by one demanding more academic freedom. Now, however, students talk in hushed tones and fall silent when a stranger draws near. Since the killings began, 1,350 students have left the university, said the rector, Dr. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Arroyave </PERSON>. Thirty-eight professors have resigned in fear of their lives, according to Dr. <PERSON> Beatriz </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON>, president of the 860-member <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antioquia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Uribe </PERSON>, a professor at the school of social sciences, said some professors have replaced classroom texts that might be considered sources of radical thought. Students stare numbly when asked to comment on a social issue, she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Uribe </PERSON> noted that death threats had prompted her to stop writing a weekly column in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>'s leading newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colombiano </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON> said she does n't know how much longer she can endure the stress. Since December, she said, she has lost 20 pounds, has nightmares, rarely sleeps well and has developed a heart disorder, severe headaches and almost constant aching in her shoulders she attributes to tension. `` I feel so watched and followed that I take a lot of detours. Sometimes I am so worried about someone following me that I'll forget where I am going,'' she said She and her husband had one German Shepherd dog but now have three. They have installed bright yard lights. `` We never, never go out after 6 o'clock anymore,'' she said. `` I do my grocery shopping all over town so I wo n't follow any routine.'' Her 10-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter are no longer permitted to go outside alone or to attend swimming classes. `` We all feel like prisoners, `` Mrs. <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON> said. Each of the professors interviewed said he or she was sure that government security forces are behind the terror. The professors said they have no doubt they are being watched every moment and that their telephones are tapped. Two professors, members of the <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, were killed after arriving at the commission's headquarters for the first time in several days. The meeting had been arranged by telephone, said Dr. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON>, a law professor. <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON>, also a member of the human rights group, said he was supposed to have been with the two men who had been killed but had been delayed. <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON> said he has taken a leave of absence from the university. Another professor was shot and killed while on his way from the university to a friend's farm. The professor had been invited by telephone only moments before he left the university, said Dr. <PERSON> Hoyos </PERSON>, the law professor. No effort has been made by authorities to investigate the <LOCATION> Antioquia </LOCATION> killings as an alleged conspiracy. As with the other similar killings in the country, the crimes are being investigated on an individual basis. Criminal investigations in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> are made by appointed judges, each of whom may have hundreds, perhaps thousands, of other cases to deal with. The government, however, can appoint a judge to devote all his time to one case if it feels the case is important enough.

<TEXT>
 In five short years, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s Ariane rocket has evolved from an Old World firecracker to a redoubtable launch vehicle, competing with Americans for the multi-billion dollar commercial space market. With bookings worth $ 2.48 billion _ 42 firm orders from around the globe _ rockets are scheduled to blast off once a month starting Sept. 8 for the next 10 months and continue at a pace of nine launches a year. They will put into orbit satellites for businesses and governments for use in improving communications, weather forecasting, telephone links or television transmission. Ariane's commercial and technological success is a source of pride for <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the rocket's main backer in the 13-nation consortium. Above all, it provides a boost to the Europeans' late bid to stake a claim to outer space. European perseverence in developing a throwaway rocket _ a dinosaur in the age of manned space flight _ is sweetened by the `` I told you so'' syndrome. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which was relying exclusively on the space shuttle for satellite launches, has not yet recovered from the Challenger disaster Jan. 28, 1986, but it hopes to re-enter the picture sometime this year with a shuttle launch. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Baudry </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> astronaut who was a crew member on a 1985 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shuttle flight, said Ariane's success should not be overstated, however. `` Ariane is just a launcher of satellites,'' he said in a telephone interview. `` In the end, Ariane performs a mission that the Russians and the Americans have been capable of for 25 years. It's a technical success, a commercial success. But there is still a long way to go before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is a completely adult space nation.'' A latecomer to space, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has a vision of becoming an independent space power. `` The great nations of tomorrow will be those that can best master space,'' said <PERSON> Baudry </PERSON>, echoing official thinking. `` The success of Ariane is essential for more ambitious programs. It symbolizes the mastery of technology.'' Major European projects include an Ariane 5 rocket capable of lifting a manned space shuttle, <ORGANIZATION> Hermes </ORGANIZATION>, into orbit a decade from now and participation in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manned space station project. Not all <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- ESA -RRB- member nations are enthusiastic about the plans. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> dissented at a ministerial meeting in November of the 13-nation agency, which also is made up of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s industry and trade minister, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, called the European plans to put men in space a `` hugely expensive industrial frolic'' with `` rather too much smacking of me-tooism.'' For now, the competition is on the ground, and it is growing fierce. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision to forbid commercial launches on future shuttle flights has given birth to a private <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space industry. Once reliant on the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rocket builders must now compete with a slick European sales machine that has been in place eight years. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> also has been wooing commercial customers for space launches through a new organization called Glavkosmos. With slick brochures and film advertisements, Glavkosmos proposes to launch communications satellites and other payloads from foreign countries aboard its powerful rocket booster, <ORGANIZATION> Proton </ORGANIZATION>. The first Soviet commercial launch earlier this year sent up an Indian satellite. Soviet space officials, however, say they are having trouble drumming up business because of Western governments' restrictions on the export of high technology equipment to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The restrictions discourage many potential customers from making a deal with the Soviets. A child of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the Ariane 1 through 4 series of rockets has been sold, financed and launched by <ORGANIZATION> ESA </ORGANIZATION>'s commercial spinoff, <ORGANIZATION> Arianespace </ORGANIZATION>, since 1980 Billed as `` the world's first commercial space transport company,'' <ORGANIZATION> Arianespace </ORGANIZATION> is devoted to selling space on rockets and placing its clients' satellites into geostationary transfer orbit, about 22,000 miles from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. In 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Arianespace </ORGANIZATION>, a French company with 50 European shareholders, who are mostly governments and state-run companies, reported a 44 percent increase in profits over 1986. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Mihara </PERSON>, director of new business for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, credits <ORGANIZATION> Arianespace </ORGANIZATION> with providing the world's only available launcher after the Challenger accident. `` But a lot of the success of Ariane was unique to the situation,'' he said. `` I consider Ariane as the new kid on the block,'' he said, noting that <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> rockets have been launched for 28 years. `` What might be new -LRB- for us -RRB- is a piece of paper. Previously, our customers were buying with <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> was the sales agent.'' <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> and its Delta rocket, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> with its Atlas Centaur and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON> with the giant Titan are the three rocket builders now at the heart of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s fledgling private space launch industry.

 He is 3 years old, wearing a red T-shirt and boasting how his dad had taken him to see the fireworks. His little sidekick sucks on a Popsicle and shows off his purple tongue. `` You ca n't get me, Daddy,'' shouts one of the boys as he races playfully down the hallway of the hospital wing. The illness that put them there is masked by their innocence and perfectly normal ways. They are the children of AIDS. Not all are so free to run and play. Some come into the world prematurely and drug-addicted. Many have swollen glands, sometimes enlarged livers and spleens. Their bodies are wracked by diarrhea and nausea, burning with fever and wet from night sweats. More than 500 of them across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have died of AIDS and 3,000 are infected, according to Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Oleske </PERSON>, medical director of the children's AIDS program at <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> Their numbers are growing at an alarming rate in a nation ill-equipped to care for them; in many places, hospitals must serve as expensive baby sitters while foster homes are desperately sought for the infants. Dr. <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, chief of pediatric and family studies for the AIDS program at the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, estimates about 10,000 children under the age of 13 will be infected with the AIDS virus within a few years. That's the low end of <PERSON> Oleske </PERSON>'s estimate; he foresees 10,000 to 20,000 infected children by 1991. `` I estimate that one in every 10 to 15 hospital beds for children in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be occupied by a child sick with -LRB- AIDS -RRB- infection. That is a frightening statistic.'' About 13 percent of the child victims got AIDS through tainted blood transfusions. Almost all the others, however, were doomed before birth, born to mothers infected with the AIDS virus through intravenous drug use or through sex with a drug user. Six out of 10 of these children die by age 2 or 3, <PERSON> Oleske </PERSON> said. The tragedy is compounded when the mother is a single parent and unable to care for the infant because of her drug habit or because she is incapacitated with AIDS herself. A grandmother may care for both, watching both daughter and grandchild deteriorate and die. With family members unavailable to help in many cases, `` Where are the increasing numbers of children born with AIDS going to be cared for?'' <PERSON> Oleske </PERSON> asked. `` Who's going to care for them?'' One answer may lie in the establishment of state-supported transitional group homes that provide temporary care for outpatient children until foster homes can be found. Several have been set up in the last 18 months, including homes in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>. More are being planned At <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, a renovated wing known as <ORGANIZATION> Dowling </ORGANIZATION> 5 South can house four children. Among current residents are the two boys whose fathers can not care for them full-time but who take them on outings like the Fourth of July fireworks. Since the Dowling wing opened in February 1987, the mothers of two children living there have died. `` Give me two weeks,'' pleaded one mother _ and she held on long enough to make arrangements for the care of her child. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, a 31-year-old social worker at <ORGANIZATION> Dowling </ORGANIZATION> 5 South, has seen dying mothers `` just coming in and spending time with their kids, playing with them, putting them to bed, feeding them supper, some of the daily routine kind of things that I think take on so much more meaning when you feel that your time could be limited.'' For many of the chidren, however, the warmth of mothers and fathers is absent, and nurses try to comfort them when they cry out with withdrawal pains. Some of the older children, unable to understand what is happening to them, turn to their toy doctors' kits and play out their own tragic lives. `` They give us fake shots and take our blood pressure,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>. `` They play out a lot of the things that happened to them in the hospital ... and kind of deal with the experience removed from it in a way.'' Many potential foster parents are reluctant to consider children with AIDS _ fearful or ignorant of the disease or unwilling to commit the extraordinary amount of time and energy required. Even so, seven children from <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clare </PERSON>'s Home in <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, have been placed in foster homes, said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Zealand </PERSON> who founded the place of transition between hospital and foster care in May 1987. They plan to open two more homes in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. `` I ca n't find a cure for AIDS. I know that I have to leave that up to somebody else but I know that I can provide a home for these children,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Zealand </PERSON> said. In <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, townspeople have been sympathetic. Local construction workers helped renovate a two-story residence that had been vacant for two years for <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clare </PERSON>'s Home. At a zoning board hearing in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, three neighbors spoke in support of the Farano Center for Children, which opened in December. Civic organizations held fundraisers and donated furniture to the home operated by <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charities </ORGANIZATION>. At the Farano Center, as many as 40 volunteers take the children for walks and visits to the park. Three of these volunters have become foster parents to AIDS children, and the applications of four others are being considered. The transitional homes can accommodate only a half-dozen or so children at a time, cared for by an around-the-clock staff. That leaves hospitals as the only home for many children of AIDS. That is costly not only to them, in terms of childhood joys missed, but also for the state. Each AIDS child's hospital stay costs an average $ 650 a day because of the extra nursing care and therapy required. This compares, for example, to $ 240 a day at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clare </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. Some of these kids have never played with a dog or felt the sunshine. `` Everything is a sense of wonder or awe for these children,'' said Sister <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>, who runs the Farano Center. `` I was planting some flowers and brought kids out with me. They sat and felt the grass. I had them help me plant flowers. They were so excited.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Zealand </PERSON> recalled a 4-year-old whose only playground was the corridors of the hospital until she moved into <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clare </PERSON>'s. `` I ca n't begin to tell you the experiences she had, swinging on the swings in the backyard, going to the parks and the playground,'' said <LOCATION> Mrs. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. `` These are the things all kids need.''

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Edkin </PERSON> stood on the front porch of the home he built with his own hands, jabbing his finger in the air and complaining angrily about a farmhouse just 1,000 yards away that's been proposed as a shelter for infants with AIDS `` Hey, it's right in my backyard!'' exclaimed the 67-year-old retired woodsman. `` I feel that we do n't need them here. <LOCATION> Sullivan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> is a nice clean county and we'd like to keep it that way.'' Like <PERSON> Edkin </PERSON>, many of the 630 residents of <LOCATION> Elkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>, of which <PERSON> Estella </PERSON> is a part, oppose the idea of the home, which would care for up to six Philadelphia-area children aged 2 and under until foster homes can be found. <LOCATION> Elkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION> residents and officials deny discrimination charges filed by the home's operators, <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> Abington </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>. In its complaint with the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Human Relations Commission, <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nest </ORGANIZATION> accused the town of trying to block the home by amending the building code and a toxic waste ordinance and by `` excessive and burdensome review.'' <PERSON> Edkin </PERSON> says his biggest concern is property values in <LOCATION> Estella </LOCATION>, a central <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> town so small it has more deer than people and includes only a dozen homes, two churches, a country store, a nursing home and the cabins that seasonal residents use for hunting and weekend getaways. It is about 200 miles from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` I talked to a real estate agent after this thing first come in,'' said <PERSON> Edkin </PERSON>. `` And I said to him, ` If I told you today I'd take $ 30,000 for my home, what would you say to me? He said, ` I'd tell you I'd give you 15. The value of property is gone right down.'' The 12-bedroom farmhouse, hidden at the top of a mile-long dirt road in this farming and lumbering region, was once a home for emotionally disturbed teen-agers. It now has a temporary license to house three infants. A 3-month old girl lives there now with her foster mother. To take in more than three young children would require costly renovations to comply with additional state and township regulations. Township supervisors amended the building code to place any group home whose income is more than $ 15,000 a year into a tougher fire safety classification, mandating sprinkler systems, fire walls, emergency lighting and fire escapes. The 100-year-old house has none of these, and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> officials and <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Eldredge </PERSON>, the social worker who directs <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nest </ORGANIZATION>, agree such renovations might be prohibitive. Townspeople and officials suggested Best Nest is a family venture out to make a buck through the $ 197 to $ 227 a day it would receive in government funds for each child and through a tax-exemption it sought as a non-profit corporation. The exemption was denied, according to <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitzky </PERSON>, the county solicitor, after Best Nest failed to prove eligibility with financial data. `` I have n't been paid a dime for what I've done,'' <PERSON> Eldredge </PERSON> said. `` I grew up in a home where there was emphasis on helping other people.'' Residents say they are being painted as the bad guys when their concern is the children's safety. The nearest hospital is an hour away, they note. Clinics and doctors, however, are available nearby, and state officials say it has not been clearly demonstrated that medical care would be a problem. The question of the children's race arose at a town meeting, but <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Reibson </PERSON>, a dairy farmer and secretary-treasurer of <LOCATION> Elkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>, said residents simply wanted all the information they could get. `` We're not trying to be discriminatory,'' she said. `` We've never said we do n't want this type home We're saying we want regulations. We feel these children have the right to have the best facility that would provide them the care and protection they need.'' But <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Edkin </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON>, says she's heard town residents `` growl about the black people.'' No blacks live in the township except for a 1-year-old boy _ tested positive for AIDS _ who is the foster child of <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Eldredge </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON>, and his wife, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>. They live next door to the proposed group home and would run it if it opens. The <PERSON> Eldredge </PERSON> brothers' parents and grandparents live along the same road on the other side of the proposed shelter.. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> previously ran the home for troubled teen-agers Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nest </ORGANIZATION> bought it for $ 27,000 from <ORGANIZATION> Berachah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit Christian group. The home was closed for financial reasons and because of problems in setting up schooling. Commenting on the farmhouse's distance from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, where the children would come from, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Eldredge </PERSON> said the family had `` looked for a home closer to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and if we had had the financial backing to purchase a home in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, we would have done that.'' `` We have used our own personal funds to purchase this home,'' he said. `` Our goal was to buy a home already licensed as a group home because we knew there could be problems with discrimination against a home for children with AIDS.'' Of the township's opposition, <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Eldredge </PERSON> said, `` I think it's representative of a few loud-mouthed people. There's quite a few people that are very positive and say, ` We agree with what you're doing. We think it's a good thing. We're behind you.''' Among those is Grace Frounfelker, a 68-year-old lay speaker in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> who was a member of the board of trustees of Berachah Farm. `` It is offering a Christian home and love to babies that were being left in hospitals,'' says Mrs. <PERSON> Frounfelker </PERSON>. `` It is a ministry which the Lord <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> upheld when he said let the children come to me and do not hold them back for such is the kingdom of God.''

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 A transvestite and a toddler with AIDS-related complex are living together in an ususual foster parenting arrangement, as officials increasingly look to non-traditional care for a growing number of children with the disease. `` We have to aggressively search out foster parents,'' said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Reim </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> is breaking new ground in the nation in the way it handles pediatric AIDS cases.'' Of the 164 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> children who have tested positive for the AIDS virus, the majority are with relatives, but 46 are in foster care and five are at a group home in <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reim </PERSON> said. His agency agreed to let a reporter visit the transvestite foster parent and child only on condition that their hometown and names not be disclosed. `` <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON>,'' as the foster parent will be called here, says his life has been fulfilling since he brought home 3-year-old `` Kevin'' in December. They live in an old neighborhood, where drug addicts and alcoholics hang out on street corners. The toddler is never far from <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON>'s side. `` I've had to cut back on entertaining my girlfriends,'' <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> said, referring to his transvestite friends. `` That's the hardest thing. ... But I have to be careful about who comes in now.'' He acknowledges his homosexuality and his penchant for living like a woman and wearing feminine clothing and jewelry. Since becoming a foster parent he has stopped working as a female impersonator, he said. He wants <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON>, who does n't know he's a man, to think of his foster parent as an aunt. `` I do n't want <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> to call me ` mom' because I'm not his mother,'' he said. `` If I kept him, as he got older I would have to someday explain my lifestyle to him. `` You know, we're all people, regardless of our lifestyles. We're all God's people, and the way we dress or act does n't make us love any differently,'' he said. `` My sexual preference is different, but nothing else is.'' <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON>'s male companion does not live at the house, but is a frequent visitor. In the course of their relationship, <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> decided he wanted the fulfillment of a child. `` I went to see DYFS, and I was a little surprised that they even talked to me,'' he said. `` They came out to inspect my home, but I really did n't think it would go through. People are stereotyped about gay people.'' When the state approached <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> about caring for an AIDS child, he was skeptical. `` Then I realized that these kids do n't get the love they should get,'' he said. `` Most people do n't want sick children, especially children with AIDS. They see them, they think they're cute, but they do n't want them. `` The first time I went to the hospital to see him, I thought he would be a little, sickly thing, but he's an adorable little kid.'' State officials say they do n't question a foster parent applicant's sexual preference. `` When we evaluate a home, we check to see if the individual or the people who will be parents in the home are able to provide a loving, safe, nurturing atmosphere,'' <PERSON> Reim </PERSON> said. Foster parents who care for AIDS children receive $ 700 a month and another stipend depending on how sick the child is, compared with the average of $ 215 per month for foster children who are not ill, <PERSON> Reim </PERSON> said. `` This is a new set of incentives to try and recruit foster parents to take care of kids with AIDS,'' he said. `` You also have to realize that some of these children sometimes need more intensive care, and sometimes will require a parent to be home full-time,'' <PERSON> Reim </PERSON> said. `` You need to compensate them for that.'' Before <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> could take <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> home, he had to take extensive lessons on how to care for an AIDS child. Rubber gloves must be worn when changing diapers. The bathtub must be scrubbed with bleach after each bath. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> must be closely watched when playing with other children. `` Wearing gloves just kills me,'' <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> said. `` To me, you pick up trash and garbage with rubber gloves. `` But to me, it's basic care,'' he said. `` When he looks at me with those eyes at night and hugs me before he goes to sleep, there's no money in the world that can buy that feeling.'' One of the harshest realities, however, is realizing that <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> may not live long. `` If he grows up to be 15 or 16, I'd be happy,'' <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> said.

 In `` Moon Over Parador,'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazursky </PERSON> reworks `` The Prince and the Pauper'' theme, adds outrageous farce and produces a marvelously comic view of Latin American politics and the acting profession. <PERSON> Mazursky </PERSON>'s earlier career was marked by relationship comedy-dramas, beginning with `` Bob & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Carol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ted </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Alice </PERSON>'' and continuing through `` Next Stop, <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>,'' `` An Unmarried Woman'' and `` <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Phil </PERSON>.'' With `` Down and Out in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>,'' he broke through with a full-throttle comedy. `` Moon Over Parador'' could repeat that success. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> is a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> actor constantly on the prowl for that one star-making role. While he is playing a supporting role in a movie being shot on the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Parador </LOCATION>, he meets the dictator-president and does an imitation of him. When the gourmand dictator dies of a heart attack during a carnival, the chief of police and power behind the throne, <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Julia </PERSON>, uncorks a daring idea: <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> could impersonate the late ruler and thus prevent a revolution. Under threat of death, the actor accepts the role. <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> leaps into the impersonation, performing a brilliant balcony speech before the populace. But of course he ca n't deceive his servants, who decide to go along with the scheme. Nor can he fool his mistress, <PERSON> Sonia </PERSON> <PERSON> Braga </PERSON>, who also agrees to keep his secret. <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> and his cohorts, who appear to be left over from old <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> movies, grow restless as <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> begins to propose liberal reforms. The natives are restless, too, and <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> is nearly killed by bombs. How he escapes from his predicament is an ingenious piece of scripting by <PERSON> Mazursky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Capetanos </PERSON>. The success of `` Moon Over Parador'' is due in large part to ideal casting. <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> brilliantly portrays the insecurities of a struggling actor, and he proves a masterful farceur. <PERSON> Julia </PERSON>, in a Prussian wig, is the embodiment of slick evil, and <PERSON> Braga </PERSON> is both funny and sexy. <PERSON> Mazursky </PERSON> highlights the comedy with real-life cameo appearances. <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> sings for the carnival, <PERSON> Ike </PERSON> <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> plays a television reporter. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Asner </PERSON> kids himself by paying a friendly visit to rebel camps in the mountains. The only disappointment is the usually reliable <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Winters </PERSON>. His CIA agent is written on the one-note venality that has become a movie cliche. `` Moon Over Parador'' is rated PG-13, for bedroom scenes and language. Running time: 104 minutes.

 Videos reviewed this week: `` Good Morning, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' `` Written on the Wind'' and `` A Tiger's Tale.'' `` Good Morning, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Touchstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>; VHS-Beta, $ 29.95; Rated R -RRB- <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of an irreverent and raucous <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> deejay in <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> during the Vietnam War. Though not necessarily the talented comic's best film role to date _ `` <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>'' and `` The World According to Garp'' may have been better _ the movie is nonetheless a one-man tour-de-force. The movie is based on the real-life antics of <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronauer </PERSON> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, who arrives in <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> in 1965, full of attitude and independence _ not the best combination for the military compulsives at <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, which is languishing under an easy-listening format. <PERSON> Cronauer </PERSON>'s mission is to put life into the narcoleptic station, and that he does beginning with his first rock' n' roll shout of `` Goooooood Morning, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>!'' He replaces <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Como </PERSON> and <PERSON> Percy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faith </PERSON> with <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. The grunts love it; military brass is appalled. And with this popularity comes an inevitable clash with military censors who sanitize the news and issue propaganda directives. But <PERSON> Cronauer </PERSON> survives his critics only to tumble into the chilling realities of the war and the authorities who help keep it boiling. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> is at home as a deejay, obviously interspersing <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> with <PERSON> Cronauer </PERSON> in what has to be one of cinema's longest and greatest improvisations. He is explosive, enormously funny and warm, injecting a humanity in an otherwise horrific landscape. <PERSON> Forest </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON>, who was later tapped to portray jazz legend <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> in <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON>'s critically acclaimed `` Bird,'' puts in an expert performance as <PERSON> Cronauer </PERSON>'s sidekick. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON>'s -LRB- `` Diner'' -RRB- direction is pristine. `` Good Morning, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'' is a contained story: There are no Kubrick or Coppola-like underpinnings, and not much really goes on outside of <PERSON> Cronauer </PERSON>'s fight with the military; nor are there major looks at the bloody battles that swirled outside <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> _ and inside, as well. Thus, it is a movie that indeed works better on the home screen than as a theatrical release. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' impassioned and humorous performance makes it all worthwhile, and besides, `` Good Morning, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'' is also a lot of fun. _ By <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editor </ORGANIZATION>.

 `` Written on the Wind'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> Home Video; VHS-Beta, $ 29.95; not rated -RRB- This 1956 Universal release, starring <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacall </PERSON>, has become something of a camp classic, a prime example of director <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sirk </PERSON>'s talent for tales of overwrought passion. Contemplated calmly, everything about the movie is hard to take seriously, from the premise, to the plot, to the scenery-chewing of co-stars <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stack </PERSON>. But that's missing the point. Forget calm. Forget serious. Sit back and surrender to this steamy saga of the oil-rich <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> family and their fatal romantic frustrations. Odds are you'll enjoy it, though you may hate yourself in the morning. Stack plays <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON>, the cynical, alcoholic scion who falls hopelessly in love with <PERSON> Bacall </PERSON> and marries her after a courtship so rapid it makes a whirlwind seem sluggish. Stack's best friend, played by <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, is also hopelessly in love with <PERSON> Bacall </PERSON>, but resolves to suffer silently. Enter <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> as Stack's sister. She is even more hopelessly in love than the others _ with <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>. Her unrequited passion has turned her into a nymphomaniac. When Stack develops a small fertility problem and <PERSON> Bacall </PERSON> turns up pregnant, it is n't hard for the malicious <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> to persuade her brother his wife is fooling around with his pal. Needless to say, before this tangled web is unraveled, a lot of blood, sweat and tears have been shed. For her part in these carryings-on, <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> was awarded an Academy Award as best supporting actress. _ By <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` A Tiger's Tale'' -LRB- Paramount Home Video; VHS @ Beta, $ 79.95; Rated R -RRB- In `` A Tiger's Tale,'' a 19-year-old high school student named <PERSON> Bubber </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> -RRB- falls for his girlfriend's mother, a divorced nurse named Rose -LRB- Ann-Margret -RRB-. It's easy to see why, but why she returns his affection _ setting off an affair lacking any heat at all _ is only one of the things that does n't make sense in this comedy-romance. There's also no good reason why <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s bratty daughter -LRB- <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> -RRB- is allowed to get away with just about anything, including sabotaging her mother's sex life by poking a hole in her diaphragm. Or why <PERSON> Bubber </PERSON>, who intends to become a veterinarian, drags around a full-grown tiger on a leash in small-town <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. And then, there's the dialogue. Rose to <PERSON> Bubber </PERSON>: `` Sometimes when your hair's messed up, you look like a partially open can.'' Or <PERSON> Bubber </PERSON> to Rose: `` I may be 19 but I'm your man and you love me, and I'm going to go sleep on the couch where a dejected man is supposed to.'' And it was n't even nighttime. <PERSON> Ann-Margret </PERSON> tries and almost rises above her role, and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Durning </PERSON> as <PERSON> Bubber </PERSON>'s father is good as usual. But the 1987 movie, written and directed by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, son to <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> and brother to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, is just dumb. _ By <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> MacVean </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Live at the Whisky a Go-Go'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Elektra </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ X The songs are short, the arrangements smart and the band rambunctious on `` Live at the Whisky a Go-Go.'' X squeezes 24 songs into the two-record set. Just about everything rocks, and just about everything clicks. Lead guitarist <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilkyson </PERSON> is the star of the show. Many of the songs, such as `` Another Perfect Day,'' are built around <PERSON> Gilkyson </PERSON>'s riffs. And his breaks combine finesse with wild abandon; they're two parts rockabilly and one part machine gun. Singers <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Exene </PERSON> <PERSON> Cervenka </PERSON> are in top form, too. Neither has a particularly appealing voice, but they blend together well and come up with some great harmonies, often when the band is playing at top speed. For the uninitiated, only the absence of a lyric sheet keeps `` Live at the Whisky a Go-Go'' from being a perfect introduction to X. It's impossible to understand what <PERSON> Cervenka </PERSON> and <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> are singing most of the time, but the general theme seems to be that life is not a beach. `` I wish it would snow in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, or at least rain and hail,'' <PERSON> Cervenka </PERSON> sings on `` Skin-Deep Town.'' On `` The World's a Mess,'' she contends just that: `` Go to hell and see if you like it,'' she suggests. It's good to know there are still a few bands out there with a bad attitude. _ By <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Wine </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` No Friction'' -LRB- Gramavision -RRB- _ Fool Proof This well-intentioned set of `` back to the roots'' blues by a group of jazz players from varied backrounds reinforces two lessons: Good intentions alone rarely get you very far, and it's not easy to blend musical styles Fool Proof combines the talents of nine jazzmen brought together by <ORGANIZATION> Gramavision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, who was dismayed that many new jazz musicians were neglecting their blues roots. The result, `` No Friction,'' though well-played throughout, just does n't measure up as a good blues record. Too often, the jazz chops sound like an intrusion on the blues arrangements. And several of the songs lack emotional punch _ a fatal flaw in blues territory. There are a few bright spots. There's a tough workout of the old <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> hit `` Love and Happiness,'' the only cover on the album; `` Red Car,'' composed by cornetist <PERSON> Butch </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, is a good, jumping tune; and saxophonist <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>' `` Title Nine Blues'' has a certain eerie charm, if you can be charmed by 7:19 of moody riffing under a recitation of lines such as, `` Red blues ... brown blues ... I do n't recall blues ...'' Ultimately `` No Friction'' fails to satisfy. One gets the feeling, though, that the musicians here will keep the spirit of the project alive as they resume their own diverse work. Which might say something good about good intentions after all. _ By <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Ben Kingsley Returns to His Roots in the Theater</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After his once-in-a-lifetime role as the saintly Indian leader in `` Gandhi,'' <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON> faced the issue of what to do with the rest of his career. He solved it by returning to his roots in the theater. Now, five years after his Academy Award, he has completed five film projects in a year. The roles range from <PERSON> Shostakovich </PERSON> in `` Testimony'' to <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> in an Italian miniseries to Dr. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> in `` Without a Clue'' -LRB- with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caine </PERSON> as <PERSON> Sherlock </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> -RRB-. <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON>'s current release, `` Pascali's <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>,'' has drawn critical praise for his carefully shaded portrayal of an informer on a Turkish-held island in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> early in the century. The British actor was here for the opening of `` Pascali's Island. He is a slight, semi-bald man whose diffident manner belies the onstage electricity he can generate as <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON> or in his one-man show about the English actor <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>. The character of Basil Pascali is full of complexities _ loyalty vs. betrayal, sexual ambiguity. How does <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON> explain him? `` Wow,'' he exclaimed. `` I hope I have explained him in my performance. I'm always hesitant to explain. It's like an artist who paints a portrait, and then he bores you by saying how he painted it and why. The painting should speak for itself. `` Pascali is a very complex character; he's hard to talk about. He exists on several levels: he's a spy; he loves a woman, and that love is unrequited; he's a man who thinks in Turkish and speaks in English; he's a man who has a very private ambition and a private dream that no one knows about. That's four levels already. `` It was easier to play the whole, composite man. You know the story of the ant and the centipede? Where the ant says to the centipede: ` How do you walk with all those legs?' And the next day the ant finds the centipede on his back, counting his legs. He'd never thought about it before I think acting is a bit like that.'' <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON> researched his role with customary thoroughness. That included the Turkish language. `` Apparently it is impeccable, I'm happy to say. There were some Turks around the location -LRB- on <LOCATION> Simi </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Rhodes </LOCATION> -RRB-. Between takes they would come up to me and speak fluent Turkish. I had to apologize and say, ` I'm sorry but I can only speak the 17 lines that are in the screenplay,''' he said. `` I had a very good teacher in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and I had eight lessons of one-hour long and learned it by ear, like a musical score. I did know what I was saying, but I learned it phonetically.'' `` Pascali's Island'' is directed by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dearden </PERSON>, the man who wrote `` Fatal Attraction,'' and co-stars <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dance </PERSON> -LRB- `` The Jewel in the Crown'' -RRB- and <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirrin </PERSON> -LRB- `` Mosquito Coast'' -RRB-. It was a reunion for <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON> and Dance. `` When I was in the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> 12 years ago,'' <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON> recalled, `` I did a play called ` Hamlet,' and I played <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> played Fortinbras. We became good friends. Theater companies do bind people together. It's like a little army of people, and we go over the top every night.'' Born in <LOCATION> Lancashire </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON> started in the theater at the top, in the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>. No spear-carrying, no repertory. He found himself performing among the most distinguished actors of the English theater. After four years, he moved to the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, then the National Theater. In 1980, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Attenborough </PERSON> chose <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON>, who is part Indian, for the epic `` Gandhi.'' After the Oscar, <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON> devoted himself to `` Kean'' and other plays, declining some heavy offers from <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. `` When I won the Academy Award, I was not too well acquainted with the community here,'' he explained. `` I'm a little bit more so now, and I'm very fond of it. But it does have an energy of its own that can rush you down a certain path, and you can get stuck. `` I have very good advisers in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> who work for the same company. They field most of the things, and they advise me very carefully. So I find that I did n't burn myself out, that five years later I can still present a variety of work. `` I think what keeps me less crazy _ because it's all relative _ is my life in the theater and going out on the stage night after night after night and being dependent on concentration, a loyalty to the play and a loyalty to my fellow actors, without whom you can achieve nothing. `` Everything is collaborative,'' said <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON>. `` I ca n't do anything on my own. That I knew before I won the Academy Award. I think that what gets jived up about the Academy Awards is how the winners stand up and thank everybody. But it's true, it's true. Nobody can achieve anything in my business on their own.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Exhibit Of Canada's Eccentric Musical Genius</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 He wore a woolen scarf and gloves in summer and lived like a hermit, communicating with the outside world by telephone. But when <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> died of a stroke nine days after his 50th birthday in 1982, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> lost not only a notorious eccentric but its greatest musician. For the first time since the pianist's death, an exhibition at the National Library in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> provides an intimate look at <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>'s life, from his checkered cloth cap to the room keys he collected at hotels across the continent, including an entire set from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Stanhope Hotel Fortunately for posterity, <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> was a pack rat who set aside one room of his apartment on <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> for scores, scripts, letters, programs, souvenirs and assorted junk. `` He wrote everything down on pads. You can almost follow him through each day,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, head of the library's music manuscript collection A packing list reminds him to bring Valium and <LOCATION> Librium </LOCATION> for his nerves, and a TV Guide. A 1966 commentary for the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says provocatively in red ball point, `` Sometimes it seems to me that <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON> has had a rather better press than he deserves.'' A letter from his grandmother recommends a mustard pack for his sore back, while <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> commiserates with an ailing <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> -LRB- `` Dear Leonardo'' -RRB- by offering some tips on hypochondria. `` I have several titles for diseases which I am expecting to have in later life but have not yet had occasion to make use of.'' After a piano technician dislocated his shoulder with a backslap, <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> distributed a notice requesting that no one offer to shake his hand. `` This will eliminate embarrassment all around.'' <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>'s international career had a sensational start. He was a Canadian celebrity at 15. He landed a lucrative <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> contract the day after his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> debut in 1955, and the first of more than 100 discs, <PERSON> Bach </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Goldberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Variations </ORGANIZATION>, is still a classic. He suddenly abandoned the concert platform in 1964 in pursuit of what he saw as a purer musical experience in the recording studio, and eventually became his own producer, controlling a mixing board the way a conductor directs an orchestra. He loved the microphone and dedicated much of his time to radio and TV documentaries, including a `` Solitude Trilogy'' visitors can sample by picking up a telephone and listening to <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> philosophize about the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>. A night owl, <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> rented a studio at <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>'s Inn on the Park because it was the only place in town he could get something to eat in the early hours, <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> said. The exhibit features <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>'s favorite Steinway, his cluttered pigeonhole desk and the rickety card table chair his father modified as a piano stool. <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> preferred a low-slung chair so that his fingers lay flat along the keyboard, the antithesis of the pounding romantic style he abhorred. An animal lover, he left his worldly goods to the animal-protecting <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The library was allowed to purchase the collection of 20,000 items, packed in 226 boxes, on condition it organize an exhibit. The display will tour <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> later this year and negotiations are under way with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European museums. The most personal documents were withheld, but <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> said there was evidence of `` two or three relationships'' with women that did not last long. In retrospect, <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>'s career is filled with irony. He searched for musical clarity and control in what he termed the `` backbone'' of a score, and dismissed virtuoso playing and tonal beauty for its own sake. However, he marred some recordings by humming along with the music, a habit critics considered an affectation. `` Readers will find the groans and croons intolerable,'' the Penguin Guide says of one Bach recording. <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> preferred the piano to the harpsichord and played no part in the rediscovery of original instruments and pitch that has revolutionized baroque listening in the 1980s. He saw nothing wrong with splicing dozens of takes for one definitive performance and envisioned an era when recordings, adjusted electronically by home listeners, would entirely replace public concerts. Yet even with today's digital compact discs, most performers and listeners favor spontaneous complete takes and concert hall acoustics. Despite reservations, <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> holds an Olympian place in Canadian music.

 <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> believes in the power of a good song. `` If people like the artist but not the songs, they wo n't buy the record,'' said <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>, who has written the hits `` Never'' for Heart, `` Love Touch'' for <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> and `` Better Be Good to Me'' for <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. `` If you go to concerts, you can see the reactions of people when they go into a song they like or know. They sing and dance and go nuts. As soon as they recognize the hit, they stand up.'' But after years of catapulting others to the limelight, <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> is seeking some recognition of her own. She has just released her debut album, `` <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>,'' and is counting on the strength of her writing to attract a following. `` I liked the songs so much that when I handed the record over to the label, I really did n't mind what song they picked for the single,'' she said. Knight grew up in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> wanting to be a rock star more than a songwriter. She began playing music at age 4 and was performing live as a teen-ager. Her talent as a songwriter emerged while she was a member of the groups `` Spider'' and `` Device.'' `` My songs were starting to be the singles and get more attention. When I left the group -LRB- Device -RRB-, I thought I'd write a song here or there and give them to people,'' she said. Her first hit came in 1983 with `` Love Is a Battlefield,'' recorded by <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Benatar </PERSON>. Knight does a softer version of the song on her own album. `` I really like <PERSON> Patti </PERSON>'s version of it. It gives people a chance to see how you can take the same song and make it sound really different,'' she said. Knight is pleased with all the interpretations of her songs, pointing out that the demos were similar to the finished product. She singled out <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> for `` You Better Be Good to Me.'' `` I think the vocal delivery really suited her; ` Better Be Good to Me' suited her. It suited her psychologically. I think she did such a great job delivering it because she really meant it,'' <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> said. Her singing style is reminiscent of <LOCATION> Dusty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, best known for such pop-soul songs as `` Son of a Preacher Man'' and `` I Only Want to Be With You.'' <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> said she does n't try to sound like any of her favorite singers, but admires their approach. `` <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>. I was influenced by him. <PERSON> Aretha </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>. A lot of my favorite singers are great but not technically brilliant.'' Knight co-produced her album with <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord-Alge </PERSON>, who has worked with <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stevie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicks </PERSON>. `` He -LRB- Lord-Alge -RRB- was very encouraging,'' she said. `` I purely went on instinct with him. Everything he said was right along the lines of what I was thinking.'' The album has a lush pop sound and little over-dubbing was used. `` It's not 48 tracks,'' <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> said. `` I did try to get three singers singing at once but I could n't use any of it because it sounded too big. It sounds rich because there is n't a lot of stuff on there so it gives room for what's on there to breathe.'' Still, songwriting is what <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> is known for, and the songs on her album were worked on over a long period of time. `` I may take months and months to write a song. I might work on it and then leave it for a while and then go back to it.'' Knight's writing is influenced by the Motown and Stax sounds of the 1960s. `` I owned a Supremes record before I owned a Beatles record,'' she said. `` I'm doing some new songs now. On one part I wanted to put horns on. The horns sounded really out of tune. They had that <ORGANIZATION> Memphis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sound </ORGANIZATION>, lazy out-of-tune horns. I was responding to those songs.'' Anyone hoping to turn an unrecorded <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> song into a hit will be disappointed: She is not prolific. `` I'm not the kind of writer that writes 40 songs and a few become hits. Just about every song I write has become a hit,'' <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> said. `` I do n't put a lot out there. In general, people call me and want to know if I have a tune sitting around, and I really do n't.'' Knight wants to tour, but will probably wait until next year. She points out again how important it is for the audience to recognize the songs. `` I'd like to have a couple of Top 10's so people will know some of the music. It's going to be more exciting for them as well as me if people know the music. `` It's down to that again: When you recognize a tune you dance and get into it. It helps tide me over. People are very comfortable with familiarity.''

 Thufferin' thuccotash! <PERSON> Mel </PERSON>, ah-say-Mel <PERSON> Blanc </PERSON>, the voice behind Bugs, <PERSON> Daffy </PERSON>, Tweety, Porky, <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> and almost every cartoon character from here to Cuc-amonga, is 80 years old and has just written an autobiography. <PERSON> Blanc </PERSON>, in a warm-hearted and fascinating new book, `` That's Not All Folks: My Life in the Golden Age of Cartoons and Radio'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION>, $ 17.95 -RRB- says <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> produced 1,003 cartoons, and he voiced 848 of them. His favorite character? Reached by telephone at his <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> home, <PERSON> Blanc </PERSON> answered in the voice of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>'s most famous bunny: `` ` Everybody knows who I am, doc. I do n't cayuh where dey are or who dey are. Even up in <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> dey know about me. HEHEHEHEH!' `` Bugs: that's my favorite character. I even have him tatooed on my shirt.'' The `` Looney Tunes'' and `` Merrie Melodies'' churned out by <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> in a dank office dubbed Termite Terrace by <PERSON> Blanc </PERSON> and his cartooning co-workers had their heydey from the 1930s to the mid - Rerun countless times, they are arguably still the funniest things on television. They parodied film stars from <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON> to <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON>, tweaked politicians and contained salty, hilarious characters that are a far cry from the phoney, unfunny goody-goodies and baddy-baddies that populate today's junk-food TV cartoon shows. The box-office success this summer of `` Who Framed <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbit </PERSON>,'' a mystery-fantasy in which cartoon characters must contend with the human world, proves that the public still eats up good animation. <PERSON> Blanc </PERSON>, in fact, did the voices of <PERSON> Daffy </PERSON> <PERSON> Duck </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Tweety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bird </ORGANIZATION>, Bugs Bunny and Sylvester the Cat in `` <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbit </PERSON>,'' but he says he has n't seen the film yet. Cartoon connoisseurs will find plenty of little known facts to relish in <PERSON> Blanc </PERSON>'s autobiography, co-written by <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Bashe </PERSON>. Just a few samples: _ The theme music for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> cartoons is a tune called `` The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down.'' _ Voice characterizations are done first, not the pictures, to the surprise of many. _ A single six-minute <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> cartoon took four or five artists sketching about 16,000 pictures and 60 backgrounds. _ Bugs Bunny in his earliest incarnation in the late'30s was called `` Happy Rabbit.'' <PERSON> Blanc </PERSON> hated the name, and in 1940 he changed it to Bugs. He decided to give him a tough-guy <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> accent, even though <PERSON> Blanc </PERSON> grew up in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and to this day has never set foot in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. _ He may love Bugs, but <PERSON> Blanc </PERSON> hated raw carrots. He chewed them for the sound effects, and filled trash cans with half-munched carrots. _ The hardest voice characterization for <PERSON> Blanc </PERSON> was Yosemite <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> since it had to be done at a constant holler. <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> was the easiest because he sounded closest to <PERSON> Blanc </PERSON>'s natural voice, except for the exaggerated lisp. After the demise of Termite Terrace, <PERSON> Blanc </PERSON> went on to do more modern cartoon characters made famous on TV, from Barney Rubble on The Flintstones series, to the Frito Bandito. <PERSON> Blanc </PERSON> gained more fame than fortune from his cartoon characterizations. The most <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> ever paid him for being the voice behind their cartoons was $ 20,000. The only hint of bitterness in his autobiography is about the way <ORGANIZATION> Warners </ORGANIZATION> copyrighted the voices of the cartoon characters <PERSON> Blanc </PERSON> made famous. It means he ca n't publicly say, `` What's up, <PERSON> Doc </PERSON>?'' or `` I tawt I taw a puddy-tat'' or such phrases he invented without getting the studio's permission. `` That is true,'' he said over the phone. `` I worked for them and I did these voices, and they in turn copyrighted the voices and trademarked them. I wanted to keep working for them, so I did n't say anything I was a jerk. I should have said something at the time.'' He did considerably better financially as a radio and TV personality. For years on the <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> program, he did the sound effects for the wheezing old <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> that the skinflint comedian supposedly drove. Most famous of all, he played the train depot caller who broke up audiences with, `` Train leaving on track five for <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Azusa </LOCATION> and Cuc-amonga!'' <PERSON> Blanc </PERSON> says at the end of his book that while he may not last forever, he has plans to allow his cartoon characters to live on. `` A lot of people try to copy my voice, but there's only one guy who can do my voice and make it actually make it sound like me, and that's my son, <PERSON> Noel </PERSON>,'' he said. Age and the emphysema which forces him to use oxygen at night have fortunately not impaired the gifted larynx of `` the man of a thousand voices.'' Well, maybe he's down to a few hundred now. The thought of retiring is, as <PERSON> Daffy </PERSON> would say, deth-picable. `` You know, I do n't think I'll ever stop until I'm dead,'' he says. `` I have to have a driver now. He drives me to work, either to <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> or one of the studios in town. I allow two hours for them to record me. It never takes that much, because they still call me ` one take <PERSON> Blanc </PERSON>.'''

 When Dr. <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> gives talks about brain transplants, he flashes two faces on the screen: <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Moe </PERSON> of the Three Stooges. People have gotten used to the idea of shifting kidneys, livers, even hearts, from person to person. But the seat of intellect and personality is unquestionably special. Despite his illustration of the differences, brain-wise, between people, <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> says the organ is just as transferable as others. `` Brain is tissue, and it can be transplanted as tissue, the way liver and kidney can,'' he says. Doctors are n't swapping whole brains, or even thinking seriously about it. But they have taken the first tentative steps toward transplanting small parts of brains, or related tissue from elsewhere in the body or from fetuses, to cure the ills of the body's most important and mysterious organ. Although such therapy has just begun, the ethical thickets surrounding it are already being explored, mainly because of one big and unresolved question: Where will the brains come from? <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> is a neurologist at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where doctors are trying to reverse Parkinson's disease by removing chemical-producing tissue from the adrenal glands and implanting it in the victims' brains. At <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, doctors have used a similar approach to treating Huntington's disease. Some day brain transplants may control a variety of other degenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. For now, most of the early testing is centered on Parkinson's, a reasonable place to start. Unlike many other brain diseases, it is limited to a small region of the brain, and its underlying complexities are fairly well understood. It also is one of the most common brain diseases. Between 500,000 and 1 million Americans, including 2 percent of everyone over 70, have Parkinson's. Once it was considered to be exclusively a disease of the elderly, but it is being diagnosed increasingly in younger people, even in their 20s and 30s. Parkinson's results from gradual destruction of a part of the brain called the nigral tissue, which makes an essential message-carrying chemical, dopamine. Victims often suffer tremors and have trouble controlling their movements. Some find it hard to stand unaided and walk, if at all, with short, shuffling steps. Patients may even be unable to hold their heads erect. There is no cure. The disease is slowly progressive, although its worst effects can be held off for a few years with levodopa and other drugs. The goal of brain surgery is to replace the damaged tissue so the brain will make its own dopamine again. There are several sources of tissue: aborted fetuses, living organ donors, the dead and the victim's own body. The most common approach in Parkinson's is to transfer dopamine-making tissue from one place to another in the patient. The adrenal glands, which lie above the kidneys, also produce dopamine, so doctors implant adrenal tissue in the patient's brain. At a conference at the <ORGANIZATION> Clinical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, Dr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> McL </PERSON>. Black of <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> and Women's Hospital here said at least 11 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> medical centers have performed this kind of operation on 70 people. `` It's not a miracle cure,'' he said. About half are better to some degree, and 10 percent are convincingly improved. <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> said the most impressive of his 11 patients is a doctor who could not walk or even stand before the surgery. Although he is far from cured, he can walk unassisted, live alone and go outside. The patient's wife left him before he got sick, but returned to care for him when he began to deteriorate. After surgery, he improved to the point that all the old animosities between them returned, and she left again. <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> said the surgery is in such an early, crude stage that doctors are unsure exactly what tissue to transplant, where to put it or what it does. `` It's like we are giving bread mold to people and do n't even know what penicillin is,'' he said. `` That's the level we are at.'' It is the only hope for some people who are going downhill and no longer respond to medicine. But there are drawbacks beyond the mediocre results so far. It is expensive: $ 30,000 to $ 100,000, depending on where the surgery is done. And it is such a grueling procedure _ actually two major operations on the abdomen and the head _ that many elderly <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>'s victims are simply too sick to stand it. <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> said one woman suffered 25 major complications, including cardiac arrest, and was in the hospital seven months. `` I ca n't tell you that she is any better than when she went into the hospital, but she's not any worse.'' To improve the outcome, doctors are considering other, potentially better, tissue sources. One is adrenal glands from young kidney donors. Another is fetuses. In January, Dr. <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrazo </PERSON> and colleagues from <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said they obtained dramatic results after transplanting brain and adrenal tissue from a spontaneously aborted fetus into two Parkinson's victims. Earlier this month, they said one of them had improved enough to go job hunting. Since then, the operation also has been done at the <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Neurosurgery </ORGANIZATION> and Neurology in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lund </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, reported that after six months, their first two patients showed no significant improvement. Some experts believe that in people, tissue from aborted fetuses will work better than adrenal tissue from the patient's own body. It would eliminate the need for surgery to gather the tissue, and because it's so immature, it might adapt better to its new locale. <PERSON> Lund </PERSON>'s Dr. <PERSON> Anders </PERSON> <PERSON> Bjorklund </PERSON> has experimented with rats that have Parkinson's, which resolves when fetal tissue is implanted and returns when it is removed. He has even successfully given them human fetal tissue. However, a human needs far more fetal tissue, <PERSON> Bjorklund </PERSON> noted. `` There is a real problem of how to scale up the procedure. We do n't know if we can obtain enough material to do meaningful trials'' in humans. Some biotechnology companies are looking for ways to mass produce the fetal tissue in cell cultures. Animal studies suggest other possible uses for fetal brains. When given to infertile mice that lack an essential hormone, the animals became able to reproduce. Fetal brain tissue also improved the memories of old rats. Dr. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> and Women's said he does n't see any overwhelming ethical barriers to transplanting tissue from aborted human fetuses. `` What would bother people about this? It's dead fetal tissue that is going to be thrown away anyway. However, researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> have been prohibited from using aborted fetal tissue in transplants until an advisory committee can think through the ethical, medical and legal issues involved. Some have worried that women might abort fetuses so the tissue can be used in sick relatives, or might even sell their fetuses for medical use. However, <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said he believes that such excesses can be avoided. `` I always believe we can draw the line and say, ` We will use it this way.'''

<HEAD>Wide Differences in Child Diabetes Risk Highlight Basic Mystery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Children in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, are about twice as likely to get the most serious form of diabetes as those in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> but face only two-thirds the risk of Finnish children, according to new research. The risk of insulin-dependent diabetes unexplainably varies 17-fold across 14 nations studied, running generally higher in cooler climates. Scientists are studying such differences for clues to a far more basic question: Just what causes insulin-dependent diabetes? The disease occurs because the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas have been destroyed by a misguided attack by the body's immune system The 1 million Americans with it must inject themselves with insulin every day to stay alive. Otherwise, sugar will build up in their blood and cause such complications as heart and kidney disease, blindness and nerve damage. Genes clearly play a key role in triggering the immune system's attack The vast majority of people who develop insulin-dependent diabetes have particular genes linked to the disease. However, most people with the susceptible genetic background do not develop diabetes, and the geographic variation in rates is evidence of an environmental role, said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> LaPorte </PERSON>, associate professor in the epidemiology department at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>. Studies also suggest that rates for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> children younger than 15 more than doubled from 1947 to 1976, which argues for a change in the environment, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Warram </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Joslin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diabetes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. What could this environmental factor be? Viral infections are one theory, since viruses show seasonal and temperature preferences as does insulin-dependent diabetes. Diet is another proposed trigger, with some support from animal studies. The question is complicated because the immune system starts attacking the pancreas years before a person shows diabetes symptoms. So any trigger must have acted at some unknown time in the past, said <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rotter </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rotter </PERSON> also said much of the geographic difference in rates may be due to differing prevalence of the susceptibility genes in various populations, rather than just environmental causes. Geographic differences are highlighted in a new study by an international team of scientists who compared insulin-dependent diabetes rates in children under age 15 from 14 countries. Their work appears in the August issue of the journal Diabetes. Rates ranged from 1.7 cases per 100,000 `` person-years'' in <LOCATION> Hokkaido </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, to 29.5 cases per 100,000 person-years in <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>. A person-year is like a man-hour; it represents the equivalent of following one person for one year. Within the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the rates per 100,000 person-years also showed variation: 9.4 in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, 11.4 in <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, 13.4 in <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Penn. </LOCATION>, 15.1 in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, 17.8 in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and 20.8 in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>. The study's overall variation was most pronounced for children younger than 5, suggesting the unknown environmental agent may exert more influence in that population, said <PERSON> LaPorte </PERSON>. `` It seems to be affecting the youngest children the most, whatever it is.''

<HEAD>Help Available For Choosing A Test-Tube Baby Clinic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A voluntary monitoring program by test-tube baby clinics may help infertile couples avoid those that misrepresent their success. More than 3,000 test-tube babies have been born in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> since the world's first, <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, was born 10 years ago in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Yet the success rate remains low. Only 17 percent of attempts led to pregnancies in 1986, the latest year for which figures are available through the monitoring program operated under the auspices of the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assisted </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reproductive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> and its parent organization, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fertility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. And the odds are that a quarter of those pregnancies did n't succeed, says Dr. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, vice president of <LOCATION> SART </LOCATION>, whose members are doctors practicing in vitro fertilization and related techniques The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> reported in June that at least half of the nation's approximately 170 test-tube baby clinics have never sent a woman home with a baby. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is considering whether it should require individual clinics to release their success rates. `` There tends to be an exaggeration of the success rate,'' says <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>. Clinics can count very early pregnancies as successes, for example, even though at least half will not result in a baby, he says. The stakes are high: A single in vitro fertilization attempt costs $ 4,000 to $ 6,000, and many couples try several times. Infertile couples who know what to ask can avoid being taken in by a clinic's inflated statistics, says Dr. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> DeCherney </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> SART </LOCATION>. The right questions are: How many cycles -LRB- fertilization attempts -RRB- has the clinic done? How many live babies has it produced? What is the success rate per cycle? How do they deal with various forms of infertility? The most reliable statistic is the number of clinical pregnancies _ those that produce a missed period _ per number of attempts, says <PERSON> DeCherney </PERSON>, director of the test-tube baby clinic at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. Clinics that do more in vitro fertilizations, as represented by the number of cycles they've done, generally are more successful than newer, smaller clinics, <PERSON> DeCherney </PERSON> says The monitoring program, in which about 115 clinics participate, does n't provide information on individual clinics but does give national figures.

<HEAD>Transplant, Grafting Techniques Could Help Against Brain Ailments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Doctors are n't swapping brains, or even thinking seriously about it, but they've taken steps toward transplanting parts of brains, or tissue from the body or fetuses to cure the body's most important organ. The ethical thickets surrounding it also are being explored, mainly one big question: Where will the brains come from? At <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, doctors are trying to reverse Parkinson's disease by implanting tissue from adrenal glands into the victims' brains. Doctors at <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> use a similar approach to treating Huntington's disease. For now, most of the testing is centered on Parkinson's, which affects up to 1 million Americans and results from destruction of part of the brain called the nigral tissue, which makes a message-carrying chemical, dopamine. At least 11 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> medical centers have tried transplanting dopamine-producing tissue from somewhere else in the body to the brain in 70 people, said Dr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> McL </PERSON>. Black of <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> and Women's Hospital. About half are better to some degree, and 10 percent are convincingly improved. Dr. <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NYU </ORGANIZATION> neurologist, said the most impressive of his 11 patients is a doctor who could n't walk or even stand before surgery. He is far from cured, but can walk unassisted, live alone and go outside. The surgery costs $ 30,000 to $ 100,000, and many elderly Parkinson's patients are too sick to stand the two major operations on the abdomen and head that are required. To improve the outcome, doctors are considering using adrenal glands from young kidney donors, or from fetuses. Some success using tissue from spontaneously aborted fetuses has been reported by Dr. <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrazo </PERSON> and colleagues at <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Anders </PERSON> <PERSON> Bjorklund </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lund </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> has had success in rats with <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>'s, but notes that a human needs far more tissue. Some biotechnology companies also are looking for ways to mass produce the fetal tissue in cell cultures. Dr. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> and Women's said he does n't see any ethical barriers to transplanting tissue from aborted fetuses. However, researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> have been prohibited from using aborted fetal tissue in transplants until an advisory committee can rule on the issues. Some have worried that women might abort fetuses so the tissue can be used in relatives, or might even sell their fetuses. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said he believes such excesses can be avoided.

<HEAD>Wide Differences in Child Diabetes Risk Highlight Basic Mystery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Children in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, are about twice as likely to get the most serious form of diabetes as those in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> but face only two-thirds the risk of Finnish children, according to new research. The risk of insulin-dependent diabetes unexplainably varies 17-fold across 14 nations studied, running generally higher in cooler climates. Scientists are studying such differences for clues to a far more basic question: Just what causes insulin-dependent diabetes? The disease occurs because the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas have been destroyed by a misguided attack by the body's immune system The 1 million Americans with it must inject themselves with insulin every day to stay alive. Genes clearly play a key role in triggering the immune system's attack, but most people with the susceptible genetic background do not develop diabetes, and the geographic variation in rates is evidence of an environmental role, said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> LaPorte </PERSON>, an epidemiologist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> A new study, reported in the August issue of the journal diabetes, compared insulin-dependent diabetes rates in children under age 15 from 14 countries. Rates ranged from 1.7 cases per 100,000 `` person-years'' in <LOCATION> Hokkaido </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, to 29.5 cases per 100,000 person-years in <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>. A person-year is like a man-hour; it represents the equivalent of following one person for one year.

<HEAD>Help Available For Choosing A Test-Tube Baby Clinic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A voluntary monitoring program by test-tube baby clinics may help infertile couples avoid those that misrepresent their success. Only 17 percent of attempts led to pregnancies in 1986, the latest year for which figures are available through the monitoring, and Dr. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assisted </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reproduction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, said odds are a quarter of those did n't succeed. The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> reported in June that at least half of the nation's approximately 170 test-tube baby clinics have never sent a woman home with a baby. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is considering whether it should require individual clinics to release their success rates. Infertile couples who know what to ask can avoid being taken in by a clinic's inflated statistics, says Dr. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> DeCherney </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> SART </LOCATION>. The right questions are: How many cycles -LRB- fertilization attempts -RRB- has the clinic done? How many live babies has it produced? What is the success rate per cycle? How do they deal with various forms of infertility? The most reliable statistic is the number of clinical pregnancies _ those that produce a missed period _ per number of attempts, says <PERSON> DeCherney </PERSON>, director of the test-tube baby clinic at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>.

 A massive vaccination drive launched by the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in May could rid most of the world of polio by 1995 _ five years ahead of the <ORGANIZATION> WHO </ORGANIZATION>'s target for global eradication, an official says. However, that will still leave desperately poor countries whose `` basic vaccine delivery system has to be brought up to speed,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> WHO </ORGANIZATION>'s Expanded Program on Immunization. About 120 countries with a total population of 4.1 billion are to be included in the vaccination drive. Only 56 percent of children are immunized against polio in the Third World, where it is the main cause of lameness. More work will be needed, <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said, in about 20 countries including <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and several in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Some 800 million people live in areas where less than half the population is immunized. The annual cost of fighting polio, measles, diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus and tuberculosis is $ 150 million, and <ORGANIZATION> WHO </ORGANIZATION> expects to need another $ 100 million to $ 500 million over the next decade just for the polio campaign. The effort is due to be reviewed in December, <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said. Some 275,000 youngsters catch the disease every year, mostly in poor countries, for lack of immunization that costs 10 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cents. The virus attacks the central nervous system in severe cases, causing paralysis. One paralyzed child out of 10 dies and most of the rest are affected for life. Past Third World drives make WHO believe most countries will be polio-free by 1995, <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said. The anti-smallpox drive a decade ago gives `` enormous inspiration and many, many lessons'' for the polio effort, but breaking the polio chain of transmission will be `` much more difficult,'' he said. Infected people are highly contagious for three weeks, but only one case in 100 is strong enough to be diagnosed. And while smallpox requires close contact to catch, polio can be transmitted through polluted food and water.

 The dollar rose swiftly in European trading this morning, recovering last week's losses. Gold prices were lower in quiet trading. Foreign exchange dealers said there was no central bank intervention in early trading but they predicted another round of concerted intervention this week to curb the dollar's rise. Traders in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> said the market was n't being led by hard economic facts or news, but by statements from public officials and a gut feeling that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration wants a strong dollar to help the presidential candidacy of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` This is a market led by declarations. -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> says one thing, the White House another, and the market reacts accordingly,'' said a senior dealer in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION>'s statement last week that a lower dollar is needed if the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is to right its massive trade imbalance had triggered a fall in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. One dealer at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> said the dollar's recovery and current strength raised the chances that the <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s central bank, will raise its discount rate at a meeting on Thursday In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.48 yen to a closing 133.88 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 133.85 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.9137 West German marks, up from 1.8925; 1.6092 Swiss francs, up from 1.5915; 6.4835 French francs, up from 6.4125; 2.1615 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1390; 1,416.25 Italian lire, up from 1,405.50; and 1.2277 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2271 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound fell to $ 1.6860 from $ 1.7025 bid late Friday.

 Although some complained about the lack of a salary hike, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> members at <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> approved a three-year contract that includes $ 2,400 in bonuses and a new profit sharing program.

The first profit-sharing plan for hourly employees would pay steelworkers an extra 89 cents an hour based on company earnings for the first six months of 1988, union officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> steelworkers earn an average of $ 30,000 a year, according to the company. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, a crane operator, said he wanted to see an across-the-board raise. `` We do n't know what the steel industry is going to do,'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said. `` The bottom could drop out tomorrow.'' <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Haines </PERSON>, president of Local 1165, said <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> strongly opposed a straight hourly wage increase because it automatically would raise the company's costs for benefits and overtime. He shared the feelings of some union members who turned thumbs down while walking in the rain to vote at the union hall Saturday. `` We told them we could n't endorse it,'' <PERSON> Haines </PERSON> said. `` It was our best effort, but not the company's.'' <PERSON> Haines </PERSON> said the agreement provides for a $ 1,000 signing bonus, to be paid in September. Workers also will receive bonuses of $ 800 and $ 600 in the second and third years of the contract. The bonuses are guaranteed, although payments in the final two years would be deducted from any profit-sharing the workers earn. <PERSON> W.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, chairman and president of <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the steel company's parent firm, said it was his `` expectation and hope that the steelworkers will do very well under the profit-sharing plan.'' The union had worked under an extended contract since September 1986 but canceled the extension last week.

<HEAD>Australia, United States to Expand Airline Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After two and a half years of negotiations, the governments of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have agreed to expand airline service between the two countries. An agreement signed over the weekend allows <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines to fly to <LOCATION> Brisbane </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cairns </PERSON> and one other Australian city, to be chosen by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and then fly on to eight other Australian destinations. The two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers serving <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, currently can fly to four Australian cities. Under the new agreement, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines also are allowed to apply for service linking the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and two Australian cities via <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s government-owned carrier, <ORGANIZATION> Qantas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, can fly to 15 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities, compared with the four it now serves. The destinations will be chosen by <ORGANIZATION> Qantas </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Qantas </ORGANIZATION> also can fly from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and will later be able to fly from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> without the restrictions it currently faces. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> said it will increase the number of weekly flights out of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> to 19 from the current 16 by the end of October, and add another three flights to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by April. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carrier, has not announced any proposed changes. The airline's manager for <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Merlini </PERSON>, said that prior to the agreement Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> already had planned to increase the number of weekly flights from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to 14 from eight. <ORGANIZATION> Qantas </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines also are expected to take advantage of the expansion through `` codesharing,'' or using a local airline to book passengers on a through flight, according to a statement by <PERSON> Gareth </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s minister for transport and communications. Under the agreement, both the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines and <ORGANIZATION> Qantas </ORGANIZATION> can operate on a new route between <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. An existing route between <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> via the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, currently open only to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines, will also be opened to <ORGANIZATION> Qantas </ORGANIZATION>. The agreement also allows for automatic approval of capacity increases in line with growth in passenger traffic. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement it plans to expand its <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> hub and inaugurate three weekly DC-10 flights between <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brisbane </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> starting next April 1.

<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rising sea levels caused by the world's warming will have `` catastrophic'' effects on many small <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> islands and some may vanish underwater, an international congress of scientists was told Monday The impact of the so-called `` greenhouse effect'' was one of many problems highlighted on the opening day of the 26th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. The week-long meeting of 1,200 scientists from 55 countries is the largest ever held in the southern hemisphere. The last congress was held in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> four years ago. Organizers said that more than 700 scientific papers would be presented this week. Scientists said the build-up of man-made gases will cause sea levels to rise by about one meter -LRB- 3.3 feet -RRB- within a century, swamping many low-lying coral atolls such as <LOCATION> Kiribati </LOCATION> _ formerly the <LOCATION> Gilbert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> _ and <LOCATION> Tuvalu </LOCATION>. The two nations have a combined population of about 68,000. Also at risk are the <LOCATION> Maldives </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> as well as the <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokelau </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, said a paper presented by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Connell </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mineral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sydney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geography </ORGANIZATION>, respectively. `` The experience will be catastrophic for some people,'' said <PERSON> Roy </PERSON>. Not only would there be very little higher ground for the population to retreat to but fresh water on the islands was likely to dry up, destroying the ecology, he said. The scientists suggested immediate attention be given to engineering works to keep the sea at bay. `` Increased migration, to high islands and overseas, is the single most probable outcome of rising sea levels,'' the congress was told. `` Some of the most recently populated islands are likely to be depopulated, and even abandoned, as a new class of ` environmental refugee' is superimposed on that of ` economic refugee.''' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> walker </PERSON>, chief ecologist of the Australian government's main science body _ the commonwealth, science and industrial research organization _ cautioned there would be some beneficial effects to the widely held prediction of `` For example, ice-free sea lanes have an impact,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said, in an interview. `` The fact is there will be a great deal of change but I'm not saying it will be predominantly bad.'' However, Canadian geographer Dr. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomlinson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ottowa </LOCATION> said a major task was to compile a data bank of existing knowledge about changes that are likely to occur. `` It is a gargantuan task,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` We would need a computer 40,000 times more powerful than anything that exists now. To understand the impact on humans is not going to be easy. Just to put the information down on paper would stand some 60 miles -LRB- 96 kilometers -RRB- high.'' Meanwhile, Prof. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Polunin </PERSON>, of the World Council for Biosphere in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, said the world is reeling under at least 20 identified menaces _ the worst of which is too many people. He said the threats range from overpopulation and nuclear holocaust to destruction of the ozone shield and human epidemics such as aids. `` Yet basic to the vast majority is the problem of human overpopulation, which in various ways is strangling the world,'' he said. <PERSON> Polunin </PERSON> said the threat of nuclear warfare, a nuclear `` winter'' and nuclear accidents was the number one horror which could bring life to a standstill with littls hope of ever recovering, while destruction of the stratospheric ozone shield, which filters off most of the harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun, already was resulting in increased skin-cancers. Other menaces, according to <PERSON> Polunin </PERSON>, include the greenhouse effect _ global warming due to the increasing buildup of carbon dioxide, methane and other trace gases _ as well as deforestation, devegetation and desertification, depletion of raw materials, insufficient agricultural land, sea-level rising through floods, widespread excessive pollutions, and climatic variations.

<HEAD>Wickes Agrees To $598 Million Management-Led Buyout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> plans to sell itself in a deal valued at nearly $ 2.6 billion to a management group headed by chairman <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigoloff </PERSON>, who led the retailing giant out of bankruptcy three years ago. The $ 12 per-share offer announced Sunday is nearly $ 3 higher than <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION>' closing stock price of $ 9.37 -LCB- Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. It appeared to reflect <PERSON> Sigoloff </PERSON>'s frustration at failing to boost the company's stock price and profits through a restructuring-and-acquisition strategy. Based in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> is one of the largest suppliers to the automobile industry, the world's biggest producer of wall coverings and major retailer of home improvement products. W-II <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a firm <PERSON> Sigoloff </PERSON> established with members of his management team, will offer to purchase nearly 40 million of <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION>' 49.8 million shares, as well as assume its debt of $ 2.06 billion. The deal values <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> at nearly $ 2.6 billion. But <PERSON> Sigoloff </PERSON> said in a statement that the agreement was structured in such a way that higher offers from other potential bidders were still possible. `` While we believe that our offer is fair, both management and the board want to ensure that the company's shareholders obtain the best price for their shares,'' <PERSON> Sigoloff </PERSON> said in a prepared statement. The offer was publicized in conjunction with an announcement that <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 12.4 million for the second quarter ending July 30, compared with earnings of $ 18.9 million a year earlier. The major participants in W-II Holdings will be institutional investors, including the Wall Street firm <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which will arrange much of the financing, <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sitrick </PERSON> said. In 1982, <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> became what was then the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company to file for bankruptcy protection, blaming the move on an excessive debt load, deteriorating relationships with creditors and declining profits. About three years later, the giant retailer was back on its feet after selling 13 of its 32 divisions and winning creditor approval for a plan allowing <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> to emerge from bankruptcy court. The force behind the comeback was <PERSON> Sigoloff </PERSON>, who earned the nickname `` Ming the Merciless'' for the tough-minded business moves and hard-nosed cost cutting. With a reputation for working up to 16 hours a day, <PERSON> Sigoloff </PERSON> got a break when <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION>' creditors allowed him to pay off $ 1.21 billion in debt with $ 289 million in cash, $ 524 million in debt securities and an 82 -LCB- percent share of the reorganized company. Part of the company's post-bankruptcy struggle has been blamed on <PERSON> Sigoloff </PERSON>'s strategy of issuing more debt to raise cash for other acquisitions, some of which ended in costly failure. In April 1986, for example, <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> bid more than $ 1.2 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gypsum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a Dallas-based building supplier. The bid collapsed when National Gypsum was acquired by its management. <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> also failed in a $ 2.1 billion hostile bid for the <ORGANIZATION> Owens-Corning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fiberglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and a $ 1.7 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> Lear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Siegler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an aerospace and automotive equipment concern.

<HEAD>Khashoggi To Repay Triad America</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Saudi tycoon <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> has agreed to pay up to $ 35 million to <ORGANIZATION> Triad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, his bankrupt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> holding company, under a tentative settlement reached by attorneys and trustees, a newspaper reported. <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, an attorney for <LOCATION> Triad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> trustee <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Neilson </PERSON>, declined to comment on the size of the settlement, but anonymous sources quoted in the <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> Tribune Monday said the amount was $ 30 million to $ 35 million. `` I think it is the best settlement we could have gotten, and I do n't think there was any money left on the table,'' <PERSON> Neilson </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` I'm basically pleased we were able to secure this money. We started this estate without a single dollar in it, and we will end up with millions of dollars to pay creditors,'' he added. <LOCATION> Triad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, a holding company of <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> and his brother <PERSON> Essam </PERSON>, and eight affiliated companies filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws in January 1987, listing liabilities of $ 197.5 million and assets of $ 9.5 million. The tentative settlement, reached Friday after a day of negotiations and subject to approval by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, would allow unsecured creditors to be paid 40 to 50 cents on the dollar, barring any unforeseen complications, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Triad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s major unsecured creditors include <ORGANIZATION> Sheraton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>. In addition, 20 other unsecured creditors have claims of more than $ 1 million, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. He estimated Triad's and its affiliates' debt to creditors at $ 50 million to $ 75 million. `` We are not done looking for other money to repay creditors,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. `` There are potentially other sources of money to enhance this. This still is not in a bank account in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, and a lot of things still could happen.'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said the trustee must satisfy certain conditions before <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> is obligated to pay the money, but he would not comment on those conditions. The $ 30 million to $ 35 million would go to the bankruptcy estate of <LOCATION> Triad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` The trustee's intent ideally would be to get an interim distribution to creditors as soon as possible,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. But the bankruptcy court first must determine which creditors have legitimate claims. `` It still could be years before the case is actually closed and final payments are made,'' he said. The tentative agreement would settle a lawsuit filed against the <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> brothers by <PERSON> Neilson </PERSON> in October 1987. The suit, which also named more than 40 companies directly or indirectly owned by the pair, sought $ 239 million in actual damages and $ 800 million in punitive damages for breach of contractual obligations and fiduciary duties. <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> indirectly owns 80 percent of <LOCATION> Triad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, while <PERSON> Essam </PERSON> <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> indirectly owns 20 percent of the company. Triad <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> obtained a court order freezing the Khashoggis' assets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and attaching specific <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assets, including a $ 51.5 million judgment against <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION> The order, said <PERSON> Neilson </PERSON>, was `` clearly what brought them to the table.'' The company's lien on the judgment will be released `` the minute the money hits our account,'' he said. The judgment against <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>, the Los Angeles-based aircraft and arms manufacturer, stemmed from commissions on sales to the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> air force and interest. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> has been in litigation with <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> over the commissions for years. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused to hear an appeal by <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> last year. But <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said, `` <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> still had some alternatives and theoretically could have tried to get out from the judgment.'' The Triad America settlement follows negotiations over a tentative settlement with <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>, in which the company would pay $ 48.5 million. But <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON>'s local attorney, said the two agreements were not connected.

 Stock prices were narrowly mixed today after pulling back last week. The Dow Jones Average of 30 Industrials, which fell 21.52 last week, was up 1.07 at 2,017.07 after 30 minutes of trading.

 Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> will leave Friday for a six-day visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> where he will sign a treaty on investment protection that has been in the works for seven years, officials said. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> also will hold separate meetings with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s four top leaders on his first visit as prime minister to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s giant communist neighbor. `` We place special significance on this visit, on the 10th anniversary of the signing of the Japan-China treaty of peace and friendship,'' a senior <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said Monday. `` <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> will review the last 10 years and discuss the future with his Chinese counterparts.''

The record performances came despite a slump in many sectors of the securities business that pushed profits at several other firms sharply lower. Prudential-Bache had profits of $ 92 million after taxes in the first six months, compared with $ 3 million in the year-ago period. Earnings in the 1987 period were reduced by more than $ 30 million as a result of the discontinuation of the firm's international trade finance subisidiary, a spokesman said. In the merchant banking department, <ORGANIZATION> Hachette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>'s purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Diamandis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> contributed more than $ 20 million to <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION>'s first-half profit, a spokesman said. <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> officials noted that beefing up investment banking operations at the largely retail-oriented brokerage firm is paying off.

 The number of working oil and natural gas rigs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> slipped by three to total 937, marking the second consecutive week of slight declines, <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reports. In last week's tally, the rig count dropped by five to total 940. A year ago this week, the count was 1,012, the company said Monday. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' rig count, the widely watched industry index of drilling activity, reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs producing oil. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an oil toolmaker company that merged with <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, has kept track of the number of working rigs since 1940. The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 active rigs in December 1981, which was the height of the oil boom. But oil prices plunged to less than $ 10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and the rig count went with it, dropping to 663 _ the lowest since <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> began compiling figures. Among major oil producing states <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> posted the biggest gain for the week with 10 additional working rigs, followed by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> with a gain of three and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> with one each. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> led declines for the second straight week with 11, followed by <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, nine; <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, six; <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, five; <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, two; and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, one. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s total was unchanged for the week.

<HEAD>Chrysler's Canadian Branch Won't Recall Cars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Canadian government can not make <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> recall 120,000 cars that may violate pollution laws even though the company recalled 492,000 cars for a similar reason in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> cars built between 1986 and early 1987 with 2.2-litre and 2.5-litre engines were recalled in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in April 1987 because a flawed fuel injector caused some cars to emit black smoke, which violated <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> pollution laws. But Canadian authorities can not force a similar recall because, until September 1987, Canadian emission laws were far less stringent than those in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s Canadian subsidiary, which has refused a request by <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> to recall the cars `` We met with <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> in July,'' says <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gourley </PERSON> of the department's energy emissions branch. `` But they said there was no reason to recall the cars because they met Canadian standards at the time -LRB- the cars were sold -RRB-.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Friday the company ca n't afford to recall old cars to comply with new laws `` Where would you draw the line on something like that, 1902?'' the spokesman asked. Most Chrysler K-cars, including <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reliants </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aries </ORGANIZATION>, were among the models recalled in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Canadian emission-control laws for passenger cars were changed in September to meet standards the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has used since 1981. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> extended its fuel-injector warranty on the questioned models to 80,000 kilometres from 20,000 kilometres in February. In the meantime, <PERSON> Gourley </PERSON> says the only way to force <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> to recall the cars is to take the automaker to court, where his branch would need `` a smoking gun ... a smoking <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'' to win its case.

 The stock market pulled back broadly this morning, taking its cue from rising rates in the credit market. The Dow Jones Average of 30 Industrials, which fell 11.03 on Friday and 21.52 for the week, was off 6.75 at 2,009.25 after 90 minutes of trading. Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of 8 to 3 among issues listed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 327 up, 799 down and 516 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume came to 42.33 million shares as of 11 a.m. on Wall Street. Trading volume has been sluggish in recent days as investors have looked for more evidence about the direction of the economy and prospects for inflation and interest rates. The economic indicators have been generally strong, but that has inspired concerns about a resurgence of inflation. Later this week, the government plans to report on consumer prices in July and second-quarter economic growth.

 Long-distance telephone service was restored early today to about 22,300 <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> customers after cables were cut deliberately in Three Rivers, company officials said. It was the latest of about 50 acts of vandalism to <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> telephone equipment since last week, when 2,200 union employees struck the company's <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinney </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> provides telephone service to 500,000 <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> customers in 58 of the state's 83 counties. The company usually has about 24 cases of vandalism in a year, <PERSON> Kinney </PERSON> said. `` We have no idea who is doing it, and we wo n't speculate,'' <PERSON> Kinney </PERSON> said. `` But there's no question the damage is intentional.'' <PERSON> Kinney </PERSON> said the cases were being reported to the appropriate law enforcement officials. Most cases involve cut telephone cables or damaged telephone equipment. Local 116 of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> called the strike after contract negotiations collapsed last Tuesday. Union spokesman <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Flewelling </PERSON> said today the union takes no responsibility for the reported damage. `` I'm certain that the company is blaming our striking workers for it. But obviously, we do n't condone vandalism,'' <PERSON> Flewelling </PERSON> said. `` What we want to do is get back to the bargaining table.'' No new talks have been scheduled. In the latest case of vandalism, about 26,000 customers in eight southwest <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> communities were left without long-distance service from 1 a.m. to 7 a.m. today after someone cut four cables at a long-distance switching center at Three Rivers, <PERSON> Kinney </PERSON> said. He said some parts of those communities rely on long-distance service to reach their sheriff's department or nearest hospital. <PERSON> Kinney </PERSON> said repair crews still were trying to restore service to about 3,700 customers in the Constantine and White Pigeon areas this morning.

 Soybean, corn and oat futures plunged their permitted daily limits early in today's session on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to heavy overnight rainfall overnight in western and central <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Wheat futures also were sharply lower. Rain was headed east into the central Corn Belt, where a summer-long drought has wreaked severe damage on the corn and soybean crops. But analysts said the rain was coming too late to greatly benefit the crops; corn plants passed their most vulnerable period in mid-July and most of the soybean crop is past the critical pod-setting stage. `` This rain should not really do that much damage to prices; we might see a rally,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Corn and oat futures are limited to daily moves of 10 cents a bushel The wheat limit is 15 cents and the soybeans are limited to moves of 30 cents a bushel except for the August soybean contract, which has no limit pending its expiration today. In early trading, wheat was 8 cents to 10 \ cents lower with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.81 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 2 -RCB- cents to 9 -RCB- cents lower with September at $ 2.77 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 6 cents to 10 cents lower with September at $ 2.49 a bushel; soybeans were 11 cents to 36 -LCB- cents lower with August at $ 8.33 a bushel Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>.

 Stock prices drifted lower this morning, as traders showed little conviction about prospects for the economy, inflation or interest rates.

<TEXT>
 Although it has plenty of oil, natural gas, coal and other sources of energy, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> is considering a nuclear power plant as a backstop against the day when the other resources wo n't be enough. Supporters of the nuclear option say the country has little choice since electricity demand on the main island of Java is expected to increase more than sixfold by the year 2015. Java is home for more than 60 percent of <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s 170 million people and uses 80 percent of its energy. Opponents insist that alternative energy sources should be enough and cite safety and environmental objections to the nuclear option. They contend that a country burdened with a $ 40 billion foreign debt ca n't realistically spend an additional billion dollars or so on nuclear power. Three experimental nuclear reactors used for research already operate at <LOCATION> Bandung </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Java </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> JogJakarta </LOCATION> in central Java and at <LOCATION> Serpong </LOCATION>, 19 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>. Officials of the Batan, national atomic energy agency, say Serpong is the third-largest neutron-producing reactor in the world after <LOCATION> Grenoble </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Brookhaven </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Subsidized by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and opened last August by President <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON>, the 30-megawatt Serpong reactor is for research on fuel elements and processing of radioactive waste and produces radioisotopes for food preservation. In opening the plant, <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON> said it was important for <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> scientists to learn nuclear technology. `` When eventually our development effort requires the use of nuclear energy to generate electricity, we will then have mastered the technology.'' Development of nuclear power now has the government's lowest energy priority, behind hydroelectricity, geothermal resources, coal, gas and oil. Gas and oil are regarded as mainly for export and earn about 70 percent of the country's foreign exchange. <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> is the world's largest exporter of liquified natural gas and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s biggest oil exporter with a 1.2 million-barrel-a-day quota from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Proponents of nuclear power are led by <PERSON> Bacharuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jusuf </PERSON> <PERSON> Habibie </PERSON>, the Cabinet minister in charge of research and technology. He is best known for establishing aircraft manufacturing in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> and is regarded as close to <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON>. The multipurpose reactor at Serpong is one of the facilities prepared to support eventual development of a nuclear generating station, <PERSON> Habibie </PERSON> told a seminar on atomic energy in June. He said Java will need an additional 27,000 megawatts of electric power by the year 2015 and available sources of supply can provide only 20,000. <PERSON> Habibie </PERSON> also said that since it will take seven to 10 years to build a nuclear plant, a decision should be made soon to head off a possible power shortage. A <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> analysis said last year, however, that <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> should delay until 1995 any decision on nuclear power. `` For the short to medium term, a nuclear power program ca n't be justified on economic grounds,'' the analysis said. It estimated that nuclear energy per kilowatt-hour costs at least five <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cents compared to three cents for conventional energy. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> report bolstered <ORGANIZATION> Indonesian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> officials who contend that the project is too ambitious and costly. <PERSON> Habibie </PERSON> and his opponents agree that <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> ca n't afford to finance nuclear power through the usual commercial methods. He proposes instead a `` build-operate-transfer'' -LRB- BOT -RRB- arrangement. Under this system a foreign contractor builds the plant, operates it for 15 years and transfers it to the government after earning a reasonable return on selling electricity. Batan, the atomic energy agency, has selected a site for a 900-megawatt plant and is studying offers to build it from three foreign consortia: Framatome of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, which is linked with <ORGANIZATION> Kraftwerk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company which has joined forces with <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on the project; and <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which is cooperating with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Marubeni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION> The proposed site is in central Java 285 miles east of <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>, not far from a dormant volcano. Java has 28 active volcanos and environmentalists question the wisdom of building a nuclear plant near even a dormant one.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Naoko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamimura </PERSON> invested in the stock market recently for the first time after a broker told her the stock of a machinery company was almost guaranteed to rise. The 24-year-old airline stewardess took 680,000 yen, worth about $ 5,200, from a low-interest savings account. She bought 1,000 shares, and in less than a month, the share price soared by nearly 40 percent. `` The salesman convinced me that the rise of the share price was promised because he had reliable insider information about the company which is not available to the public,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Kamimura </PERSON>'s profit is an example of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s traditional acceptance of insider trading, which in other financial centers is considered an unfair strategy for profiting in stocks through the use of confidential information. But <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is under intensifying pressure to abandon some traditional practices and adopt standards accepted in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> as the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> exchange has grown into the world's largest stock market. Foreign and some domestic investors are urging the government to take tougher measures against dubious practices, warning that the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market will lose credibility with foreign investors, whose presence in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> is rapidly growing. As a result of these pressures and recent scandals, the government is tightening a weak law on insider trading and expanding restrictions on securities firms and banks. Among the scandals: _ Last September, <ORGANIZATION> Hyogo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sogo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Osaka </ORGANIZATION> was suspected of insider trading when it hastily sold large holdings of <ORGANIZATION> Tateho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> shares prior to the announcement that <ORGANIZATION> Tateho </ORGANIZATION> had lost several million dollars speculating on bond futures. Later, it was learned that <PERSON> Tateho </PERSON> had revealed the loss to <ORGANIZATION> Hyogo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sogo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, its creditor, before the public announcement. _ In July, the political and business worlds were shocked when aides to top leaders including Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> were found to have earned up to $ 800,000 by trading unlisted shares of a real estate company, <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> _ Also in July, massive insider trading was suspected when the share price of <ORGANIZATION> Sankyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seiki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> jumped hours before it was announced that <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest steelmaker, had acquired a stake in <ORGANIZATION> Sankyo </ORGANIZATION>. Both the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> are investigating the case, and it has been revealed that a large number of employees of both companies bought <ORGANIZATION> Sankyo </ORGANIZATION> shares before the deal was made public. Shortly after the Tateho case broke, the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> decided to revise the Securities and Exchange Law and significantly enlarge the ministry's investigatory and surveillance functions on stock dealings. The Diet, the Japanese parliament, passed the revised law in May and it will be implemented by October. For the first time, criminal punishment was introduced for insider trading; that provision is to take effect next April. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said while visiting <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> in February that the bill covered `` 98 percent of what we cover in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of illegal trading.'' <PERSON> Keisuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsuura </PERSON>, a private investment consultant who has followed the Japanese stock market for more than 30 years, said the disclosure of the Recruit Cosmos case, with its links to top political aides, was itself a sign of change. `` Five years ago, behind-the-door dealings like these were routinely practiced but they were never revealed,'' <PERSON> Matsuura </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, the securities industry is taking steps against insider trading. <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the largest securities house in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and one of the largest in the world, recently announced that it is separating corporate and investment sections and will block the flow of information between the two _ a barrier known in the investment trade as the `` Chinese Wall.'' It's intended to block a major potential source of inside information. Earlier this month, the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> requested member companies to streamline the disclosure process and asked for the prompt release of corporate information which may affect share prices. Despite such favorable signs, many market participants believe the dominance of traditions and customs wo n't change easily by simply establishing new rules and restrictive measures. `` The mentality of the investors and stockbrokers has to be changed drastically if insider trading is to be stopped,'' said <PERSON> Matsuura </PERSON>, who is also familiar with overseas stock markets. <PERSON> Keiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishida </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> office commented: `` All those changes we hear lately seem to be just bluffs.'' <PERSON> Nishida </PERSON>, who worked for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> until recently, believes it will require what he called a near miracle to change the fundamental nature of the Japanese stock market. Interviews with brokers and officials at securities firms, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, showed how hard it will be to change the tradition of insider trading. `` I ca n't recommend my clients what to buy if I have no insider information at all, and my clients wo n't buy shares if I ca n't give them useful information,'' said a broker at one of the top four securities firms in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>It's RIP for IBM's RIP, A Dealer Incentive Plan That Misfired</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is preparing to drop a dealer incentive plan that misfired by driving down the street price of the Personal System-2. The program began Jan. 1 and was supposed to last for a year, but will be dropped after Sept. 30 because of complaints by some dealers, said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Savitt </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. Some dealers took the credits and bonuses that they received for achieving sales targets and applied the money to lowering their prices. That disturbed other dealers, who said the plan was eroding their profit margins. In order to mollify dealers who like the plan, incentives will be made richer until the program ends. <PERSON> Savitt </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> has not decided what to replace the program with. On another matter, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Monahan </PERSON> said last week the company has no intention of reintroducing the PC AT, which it phased out after introducing the Personal System-2 line in April 1987. Confusion may have arisen because <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> is planning to introduce a computer that uses the same microprocessor as the AT, <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s 80286, and does not run the new Operating System-2 Currently the only members of the Personal System-2 family that do n't use the new operating system have less powerful microprocessors. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> has not specified when such a computer might be released, but has said since February that introducing one was part of its strategy.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Stock prices closed lower in the slowest trading day of the year, with investors concerned that British interest rates may be raised again. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 12 points, or 0.7 percent, lower at 1,832.3. Volume was a scant 231.5 million shares, the lowest recorded in 1988, and well down from 342.4 million shares on Friday. The market remained depressed throughout the trading session by fears of another increase in the British commercial banks' base lending rate, which was raised to 11 percent from 10.5 percent two weeks ago. The government has raised interest rates several times this year to choke off potentially inflationary growth in the British economy. `` We certainly would n't rule out another rise in the short term,'' said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION> Warburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. But the government might wait for more economic data to be released, and assessed, before acting, he added. Investors are awaiting Thursday's release of British trade figures for July, dealers said. Market sentiment also was undermined by the low level of trading activity during the summer vacation season, dealers said.

 Stock prices slumped broadly this afternoon, extending last week's losses in moderate activity. The Dow Jones Average of 30 Industrials, which fell 11.03 on Friday and 21.52 for the week, was off 18.49 at 1,997.51 with two hours left in the session.

 Futures prices of soybeans, corn and oats plummeted their permitted daily limits Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to heavy showers in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and slack foreign demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain and soybean products.

But analysts said the rain was coming too late to greatly benefit the crops; corn plants passed their most vulnerable period in mid-July and most of the soybean crop is past the critical pod-setting stage. `` The rain was the catalyst'' for the sell-off, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` But the thing behind it all is that demand is still not very good,'' he said. `` We need an increase in demand to get this market moving and we're just not getting it.'' <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Luth </PERSON>, a soybean analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, agreed. `` The market's waiting for the demand to develop, and with no players, it moves lower,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION> will try a new approach _ a public auction _ to sell more than $ 75 million in shaky loans it acquired in its 1984 bailout of the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, officials said Monday. Parties ranging from other financial institutions to collection agencies and `` vulture funds'' are likely to join in the bidding on Oct. 20, according <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zegart </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> JBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which will conduct the open-outcry auction in a ballroom at a downtown hotel. The loans, which include commercial, real estate, energy and personal loans, are among $ 5.2 billion in <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> loans the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> purchased for $ 3.5 billion as part of its $ 4.5 billion plan to save the bank from failure. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, acting as the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>'s administrator, has collected on or disposed of problem loans with a face value of more than $ 3.7 billion since the federal rescue, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemmons </PERSON>, a member of the bank team in charge of the effort. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> will assume sole responsiblity for disposing of any loans that are not sold or collected on by Nov. 1, <PERSON> Lemmons </PERSON> said. Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> JBS </ORGANIZATION> pioneered the auction approach to loan sales, holding the first such event last October when it generated about $ 2.7 million from the sale of $ 8 million worth of loans made by two failed central <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> banks, <PERSON> Zegart </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> opted for the public-auction route after a failed offering of $ 1.2 billion worth of the problem loans. None of the sealed bids received for that package met the minimum price set by the agency. `` The biggest advantage is that -LRB- the public auction -RRB- provides a sense of confirmation for buyers,'' <PERSON> Zegart </PERSON> said. `` It provides an opportunity for them to be in an open forum and see how their peer group values certain assets.'' Prices paid at similar, though smaller, <ORGANIZATION> JBS </ORGANIZATION> loan auctions ranged from a penny per dollar of face value for the most hopelessly uncollectable loans to 95 cents on the dollar, he said. The worst-case loans, called `` charge-off'' loans because they are regarded by the seller as not worth the cost of collecting, typically are purchased for pennies on the dollar by collection agencies and investment pools called `` vulture funds,'' the officials said. Loans with a better chance of being repaid may be bought by thrifts, savings and loans or sophisticated investment groups that are prepared to work out payment schedules or take the debtor to court, <PERSON> Zegart </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lemmons </PERSON> said the package of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> loans being readied for auction would be `` heavily skewed'' toward charge-off loans.

 The stock market finished broadly lower today, as worries that interest rates may continue rising helped extend last week's losses. The decline occurred in relatively sluggish activity. Analysts said many investors stayed away from the stock market in advance of a flurry of economic reports due to be released later this week. The government plans to report this week on consumer prices for July and second-quarter economic growth, among other things. The economy has been growing at such a strong pace that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> boosted its discount rate by a half percentage point to 6.5 percent earlier this month in a bid to head off inflation. Some stock market analysts feel further rate increases may be forthcoming, a development that would make <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues more attractive to big institutional investors at the expense of the uncertain returns on stocks. Today, yields on the closely-watched 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond edged past the 9.40 percent mark after finishing below that level last week. Analysts said traders were worried that Tuesday's scheduled report on consumer prices would show a big jump that would encourage the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to tighten credit conditions further.

 A management group's offer to take <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc. private in a $ 598 million leveraged buyout has brought numerous inquiries from other potential buyers, the company's investment banker said Monday The $ 12-a-share tender offer, made late Sunday by a management group led by <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigoloff </PERSON>, included a 60-day wait before the group would begin buying <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> stock to give other bidders a chance to emerge. Numerous potential buyers called Monday, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennenbaum </PERSON>, senior managing director at <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which was retained to advise <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> management on the offer <PERSON> Tennenbaum </PERSON> would n't reveal names, but said some callers were interested in buying the company intact and others sought information on some of its parts. `` Our phones have been ringing off the hook,'' <PERSON> Tennenbaum </PERSON> said. `` People who have a prima facie financial capacity to do this transaction are calling in impressive numbers.'' <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION>' stock closed at $ 13.25 a share Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, up $ 3.87 a share from Friday's close. A buyer of <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> would have to assume $ 2.1 billion in debt. The company's main lines of business are industrial products, including auto fabrics and aircraft and missile parts; home improvement and furnishings, including <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Furniture </ORGANIZATION> and Builders Emporium do-it-yourself stores in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>; and a group that makes wallpaper and carpet. <PERSON> Sigoloff </PERSON>, who led <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> out of bankruptcy proceedings 3 -LCB- years ago, said the management group financed by <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> would n't begin buying shares until Oct. 20, and did n't make it a condition of the deal that the company refuse other bids. `` While we believe that our offer is fair, both management and the board want to ensure that the company's shareholders obtain the best price for their shares,'' <PERSON> Sigoloff </PERSON> said in a news release announcing the leveraged buyout offer. The 60-day delay in purchasing shares was intended `` to ensure that ample opportunity is afforded to determine whether it is possible to achieve a higher price for our stockholders,'' he said. <PERSON> Sigoloff </PERSON> refused an interview request Monday, and a company spokesman declined to expand on Sunday's statement. The group is offering $ 12 a share for up to 83 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION>' 49.8 million outstanding shares. If the buyout is consummated, each share that is n't purchased would be exchanged for a share of a new class of preferred stock valued at $ 12 a share. The offer is contingent on 50 percent of outstanding shares being offered for sale, and on obtaining financing, the company said. In announcing the buyout offer, <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> said it lost $ 12.4 million in the second quarter, in contrast to its profit of $ 18.9 million in the second quarter of 1987. Second-quarter sales were $ 937.9 million, up from $ 865 million a year earlier. <PERSON> Sigoloff </PERSON> and others in management run little risk in making the offer, said <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Childress </PERSON>, an analyst who follows the company for <ORGANIZATION> Harper </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McLean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. `` They win either way,'' <PERSON> Childress </PERSON> said. `` They either are successful and get it at $ 12 a share ... or somebody comes in and offers a bit more and they win anyway.'' Some analysts suggested the heavy debt burden made it unlikely the price would rise much beyond the $ 12 offer. Others suggested potential buyers might be interested in various of <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION>' diverse businesses rather than in running the company as presently organized. `` What you have in <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> are leadership niches in three major markets,'' said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He valued the company at $ 12 to $ 15 a share. <PERSON> Sigoloff </PERSON> brought the company out of bankruptcy in January 1985 to embark on a buying spree that included the acquisition of consumer and industrial products lines from <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, home improvement businesses from <ORGANIZATION> W.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Collins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aikman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> manufacturer of auto interiors, fabrics and wallpaper. <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> made unsuccessful bids for National Gypsum of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Owens-Corning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fiberglass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Lear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Siegler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> aerospace and auto equipment manufacturer.

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Higher; Gold Prices Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar finished mostly higher Monday in skittish domestic trading after rising sharply overseas in the face of concerted central-bank intervention. Gold prices were mixed. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a late bid price for gold of $ 433.20 a troy ounce, up from $ 431.25 late Friday. The dollar gained over the weekend in the Far East and continued to move higher when trading shifted to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Dealers said there was no fundamental reason for the dollar's strength except that the market simply is bullish toward the currency. `` The dollar is the flavor of the month, and people are going for it,'' said <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Dipple </PERSON>, chief dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Banque </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francaise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exterieure </ORGANIZATION>. A host of European central banks joined the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> in selling dollars when the currency was trading at about 1.9150 West German marks, but dealers said the dollar slipped only temporarily and then resumed its rise. The dollar closed higher in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and managed to finish mostly higher in domestic dealings despite a heavy bout of profit-taking and late central-bank intervention. `` It was really wild on the downside,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, commenting on the tumble the dollar took when the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> intervened. Despite the intervention, the dollar `` is still well in demand,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON>, chief dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. He noted that investors `` are getting more and more complacent about intervention _ they are more willing to hold onto dollars'' when the central banks sell the currency. Traders noted that the market was very thin. `` There's a lack of liquidity,'' <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said. `` That accentuates the dollar's moves.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar rose 0.48 yen to a closing 133.88 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted higher at 134.05 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the dollar closed at 133.63 yen, down from 133.69 yen on Friday. The pound fell sharply against the dollar. One dealer cited disappointment that an expected increase in British interest rates did n't materialize. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> it cost $ 1.6767 to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.7025 late Friday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> it cost $ 1.6860 to buy one pound, less expensive than late Friday's $ 1.6987. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Friday, included: 1.9086 West German marks, up from 1.8965; 1.6075 Swiss francs, up from 1.5954; 6.4680 French francs, up from 6.4193; 1,412.00 Italian lire, up from 1,405.00, and 1.2285 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2301. Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Friday: 1.9190 West German marks, up from 1.8925; 1.6105 Swiss francs, up from 1.5915; 6.5050 French francs, up from 6.4125; 2.1605 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1390; 1,417.00 Italian lire, up from 1,405.50, and 1.2291 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2271. Gold for current delivery on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> rose to $ 433.60 a troy ounce from $ 431.70 late Friday. Gold held steady in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, finishing at a late bid price of $ 432 a troy ounce, unchanged from Friday's late bid. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold fell to a closing bid of $ 431 an ounce, compared with $ 432.50 late Friday. Earlier in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 1.61 to close at a bid $ 432.01 an ounce, compared with Saturday's $ 433.62. Silver prices also were mixed. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Comex, silver for current delivery rose to $ 6.730 a troy ounce, from $ 6.657 late Friday. Silver bullion prices fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where the metal was trading at a late bid price of $ 6.64 an ounce, compared with Friday's $ 6.68.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Collapse On Wet Weather, Slack Demand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Soybean, corn and oat futures prices plummeted their permitted daily limits Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to heavy showers in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and slack foreign demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain and soybean products. Wheat futures also closed sharply lower. On other markets, livestock and meat futures fell; platinum posted sharp gains to lead precious metals futures higher; energy futures were mixed; and stock-index futures retreated. Rain was moving east Monday into the central Corn Belt, where a summer-long drought has wreaked severe damage on the corn and soybean crops. But analysts said the rain and cooler temperatures were coming too late to greatly benefit the crops; corn plants passed their most vulnerable period in mid-July and most of the soybean crop is past the critical pod-setting stage. `` The rain was the catalyst'' for the selloff in the grain futures market, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader for <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Corn and oat futures were limited to daily moves of 10 cents a bushel The wheat limit was 15 cents and the soybeans were limited to moves of 30 cents a bushel except for the expiring August soybean contract, which had no limit. Monday marked the 10th consecutive week in which soybean futures have advanced or declined the limit on the first trading day of the week. Wheat settled 7 -RCB- cents to 11 cents lower with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.81 a bushel; corn was 3 -RCB- cents to 10 cents lower with September at $ 2.77 \ a bushel; oats were 10 cents lower across the board with September at $ 2.49 a bushel; soybeans were 23 -LCB- cents to 32 -LCB- cents lower with August at $ 8.37 a bushel Cattle futures posted steep losses on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on expectations that cash prices would fall later this week as demand declines, analysts said. `` We're coming into Labor Day and most of the buying for the Labor Day holiday has been completed, so there is expected to be some slackening of demand as result,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. Pork futures prices declined on ideas the cooler weather in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> would result in farmers bringing more hogs to market, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said The frozen pork belly market received some potentially bullish news after the close. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s monthly cold-storage report showed 73.7 million pounds of pork bellies in cold storage on Aug. 1. The number, while much higher than last year's 28.6 million pounds on the same date, was below market estimates, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said. Live cattle settled .65 cent to 1.38 cents lower with October at 70.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .55 cent to 1.32 cents lower with August at 81.55 cents a pound; hogs were .50 cent to 1.20 cents lower with October at 40.37 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .55 cent to 1.93 cents lower with August at 36.25 cents a pound. Platinum futures leaped more than $ 11 a troy ounce in fairly active trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on strong technical signals, analysts said. Gold and silver futures followed on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, ignoring the normally bearish input of weaker grain futures and foreign currency markets, said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON>, precious metals analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. Platinum settled $ 11 to $ 11.50 higher with October at $ 546.20 a troy ounce; gold was $ 1.80 to $ 1.90 higher with October at $ 437.40 a troy ounce; silver was 7 cents to 8 cents higher with September at $ 6.74 a troy ounce. Energy futures prices closed mostly higher Monday in quiet trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts said the market was driven by mainly technical factors. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 4 cents lower to 6 cents higher with September at $ 15.76 a barrel; heating oil was .16 cent to .26 cent higher with September at 44.73 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .07 cent lower to .15 cent higher with September at 47.52 cents a gallon. Stock-index futures retreated on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on fears of higher interest rates. The contract for September delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index finished 5.35 points lower at 256.60.

<TEXT>
 The new chief of <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday he is basing his plans for the nation's fourth-largest energy company on oil prices below $ 20 a barrel. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Derr </PERSON>, 52, elected chief executive officer last Friday by the company's board of directors, also told a news conference he expects oil prices to continue to move in a volatile pattern. `` Ultimately oil prices are going to increase significantly,'' said <PERSON> Derr </PERSON>, who takes over from <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> on Jan. 1. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> will `` continue with an -LRB- oil -RRB- exploration program and projects that will be important to us,'' he added. The selection of <PERSON> Derr </PERSON>, who has been one of <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>'s two vice chairmen for nearly three years, was widely expected. It follows the company's report that it earned $ 520 million in the second quarter, up 45 percent from its profits in the year-earlier quarter. <PERSON> Derr </PERSON>'s most challenging assignment at the company was his supervision of the merger with <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> following <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 13.3 billion acquisition of <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> in 1984. <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>, 64, will take mandatory retirement at 65 after more than seven years at the helm of <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Derr </PERSON>'s appointment is n't expected to bring major changes at the international oil giant, obsevers said. In response to a question, <PERSON> Derr </PERSON> noted the fierce opposition by environmentalists to oil drilling offshore <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. He gave a strong hint, however, of what <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>'s attitude on the question will be. `` I think the country is facing serious problems in the future in terms of its energy supplies, `` he said. `` -LRB- Oil -RRB- imports are up to 40 percent -LRB- of total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumption -RRB- today; they'll be over 50 percent in the next couple of years, and who knows from there? `` I think it's important that the country adopts policies that allow for maximum development of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> energy reserves,'' he added.

<TEXT>
 Interest-rate worries drove the stock market broadly lower on Monday, pushing the closing Dow Jones Industrial Average below 2,000 for the first time in nearly three months. `` This is very nervous trading,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, head of block trading at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` This is n't the kind of market that's going to bring people off the sidelines.'' The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which lost 21.52 points last week, gave up another 25.78 to close at 1,990.22. That was the lowest closing level for the market's best-known indicator since it finished at 1,956.44 on May 27, the day before the three-day Memorial Day holiday. When traders returned May 31, the Dow climbed 74.68 points and the industrial average finished above 2,000 every day since then. Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of nearly 3 to 1 among issues listed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 385 up, 1,107 down and 466 unchanged. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> index fell 1.60 to 145.94. The pace of trading was sluggish, however. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> amounted to 122.25 million shares, down from 122.37 million shares on Friday. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 144.90 million shares. As the market opened, stock prices pushed marginally higher, but quickly reversed course when a decline in bond prices drove fixed-income yields higher. Analysts said the yields available in the bond and money markets are keeping many investors out of the stock market. That inclination was even more pronounced on the eve of the first of a flurry of economic reports due to be released this week, analysts said. The government plans to report Tuesday on consumer prices for July. Later in the week, it planned to revise its estimate of second-quarter economic growth, among other things.

On Monday, prices of the widely-followed 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond fell $ 5 for every $ 1,000 in face value, pushing its yield to 9.45 percent from 9.39 percent on Friday. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, director of technical market analysis for the brokerage <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, said yields on shorter term issues are also attractive. He noted that 5-year Treasury issues are yielding about 9 percent, for instance, while the Dow Jones industrials have lost more than 160 points since early July. `` As long as stocks are going down, these will provide some very stiff competition for the investors dollar ... The institutional investor who has substantial cash reserves is saying, ` Why bother?

<HEAD>HUD Faults Foreclosure Complaint of Homeless Advocates</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> said Monday the demands of a homeless assistance group to stop the sales of foreclosed single-family dwellings would bankrupt a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> mortgage insurance fund. The fund, sustained by the collection of mortgage insurance premiums from homebuyers who use <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> mortgage insurance, has helped millions of first-time, low - and moderate-income homebuyers since its creation in the 1930s, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> said `` If we suspended sales, the <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> fund would be out of operation by the end of 1990,'' said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> general counsel. Earlier this month, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> called off a national sales campaign, which the department hoped would unload 15,000 foreclosed single-family properties, and it canceled an auction of 158 foreclosed <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, D.C.-area homes last weekend. The action was taken because of the threat of a lawsuit by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>, which claims <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> is violating a homeless-assistance law passed last year that requires government agencies to consider the needs of the homeless before selling foreclosed properties. <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> does not consider the foreclosed, single-family dwellings it is selling to be surplus property. The department considers the homes to be inventory, he said. Additionally, he said <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> makes available all of its foreclosed single-family homes to homeless providers at a discount of 10 percent below fair market value before the homes are listed for sale to the public. The agency also offers homeless providers lease-purchase agreements for the HUD-owned homes at a cost as low as $ 1 per year, he said. The provider is responsible for maintaining the property and paying the property taxes during the lease period. Since 1985, the agency has transferred about 200 single-family homes to homeless providers, about half by sale and half by lease, he said. <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> said the department is reviewing its process of making single-family homes available to homeless providers and <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials plan to meet with representatives of the Berkley, Calif.-based National Housing Law Project soon to discuss possible changes. The National Housing Law Project, however, is not satisfied. The group, which assists lawyers helping indigent clients with housing cases, is threatening again to challenge the housing sale in court. <PERSON> Florence </PERSON> <PERSON> Roisman </PERSON>, a staff attorney for the project, said the group planned to file suit in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> on Tuesday to challenge a scheduled sale there.

<HEAD>Dissident Miners Sue Union</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PIKEVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of miners Monday filed a $ 1 billion federal lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and its leadership, claiming the union prevented it from recovering wages lost during a 3 -LCB- - year strike The lawsuit contended the union did not represent the miners properly and discriminated against them because they did not take part in selective picketing. Named in the suit filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> included <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> president; <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, vice president; and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Banovick </PERSON>, secretary-treasurer. Each was accused of conspiring to keep the 406 plaintiffs from collecting benefits to which they should have been entitled. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>, a spokesman for the so-called `` Forgotten 400,'' said the lawsuit stemmed from an agreement reached in May between the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> A.T. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and its subsidiaries to end selective strikes launched against two eastern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> mines in 1984. The agreement, requiring payment of $ 4.47 million to the union, also settled a lawsuit challenging <PERSON> Massey </PERSON>'s decision to turn the mines into non-union operations. About 700 miners, including <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>, worked at the two mines until February 1983 when all but a maintenance crew were laid off. The remaining miners workers lost their jobs Sept. 30, 1984, the day before the two mines were sold to <ORGANIZATION> Sidney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Ora </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an operation owned by <PERSON> Massey </PERSON>. After the agreement was announced, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said the $ 4.47 million for lost wages and benefits would be divided among about 250 miners, who had been on selective strikes, with each receiving about $ 18,000. <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jacket </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said the lawsuit contends that the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> breached its duty of fair representation by limiting the number of members who would receive payments <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> and other plaintiffs also contend they have been excluded from union meetings, thus violating the organization's constitution The lawsuit asks for a jury trial, plus $ 500 million in compensatory and $ 500 million in punitive damages. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, union spokesman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> said late Monday that the union's legal department had not yet seen the lawsuit. But <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> said, `` The union is very confident that that settlement will be upheld in any court.'' <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> pushed for the union's use of selective strikes, and on Oct. 1, 1984 <PERSON> Massey </PERSON> became the first target after the company refused to sign the union's national coal wage contract. Signing would have given <PERSON> Massey </PERSON>'s laid-off employees companywide re-employment rights. The union finally called off the sometimes violent strike in December 1985 when <PERSON> Massey </PERSON> agreed to settlement of an unfair labor practice charge, but selective strikes against the two subsidiaries continued until May.

 <ORGANIZATION> Rockwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to pay more than $ 1 million to settle lawsuits involving <ORGANIZATION> E.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in a complex mortgage insurance case, <ORGANIZATION> Rockwood </ORGANIZATION> officials announced Monday. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauterbach </PERSON>, a member of <PERSON> Rockwood </PERSON>'s board and chairman of its executive committee, said the settlement included a payment of $ 550,000 on Monday plus $ 200,000 annually for three years beginning in 1989. The agreement also provided for both parties to mutually release all outstanding liabilities. `` The payments are a modest settlement to get rid of all the litigation,'' <PERSON> Lauterbach </PERSON> said. `` We felt it was worthwhile to settle it and get it behind us. We consider this an extremely satisfactory settlement.'' In 1985, <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> _ which was acquired earlier this year by <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ announced plans to sue <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> in connection with <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>'s purchase of about $ 64 million in mortgage loans from First American A major portion of the loans was delinquent, and <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> claimed the loans were insured fully by <PERSON> Rockwood </PERSON>. Subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> E.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> sued <ORGANIZATION> Rockwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, seeking recovery under the surety bond issued by the company. The suit demanded <PERSON> Rockwood </PERSON> pay <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> the amount of the outstanding balances of all delinquent loans, which then totaled more than $ 32 million and with more delinquencies could have increased to the full amount of the loans. <PERSON> Rockwood </PERSON> sued <ORGANIZATION> E.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, alleging non-compliance and violations of the surety bond and asking the court to declare the bond void and unenforceable. <ORGANIZATION> Rockwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Rockwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> also filed a separate complaint seeking damages from <ORGANIZATION> E.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and its parent, <ORGANIZATION> E.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, in connection with the transactions between <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> <PERSON> Mortgage </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Rockwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION>. In May, a federal judge dismissed <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>'s motions to have <PERSON> Rockwood </PERSON>'s complaints dismissed and <PERSON> Rockwood </PERSON>'s motion to dismiss the <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> complaint. <PERSON> Lauterbach </PERSON> said that since the litigation the company has stopped writing financial insurance, such as the mortgage insurance that was at issue in the <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> litigation.

<HEAD>Venezuela President Blasts Foreign Creditor Banks at International
Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Venezuelan President <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Lusinchi </PERSON> leveled harsh criticism at foreign commercial banks Monday, blasting them for what he called their `` speculative'' treatment of Latin American debtors. `` Either we are loyal to our peoples and we look after their well-being, or we yield with those who impose conditions on us and violate our rights, and who only feel egoism, opulence and insatiable avarice,'' <PERSON> Lusinchi </PERSON> told conference delegates from 23 Spanish and Portuguese-speaking nations of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` The speculative criteria that predominates in big financial centers is incompatible with the interest of all people on earth,'' <PERSON> Lusinchi </PERSON> said. The president spoke during the opening ceremony of the Sixth IberoAmerican Conference held to organize the planned 1992 celebrations of the 500th anniversary of the discovery of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lusinchi </PERSON>'s remarks come as <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> is seeking about $ 2.5 billion in new loans from foreign financial institutions to help cover a balance of payments deficit. Commercial banks widely are expected to seek economic austerity measures as a condition for new lending to <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lusinchi </PERSON> labeled as `` absurd'' <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s current economic situation, in which countries from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> are struggling to pay foreign debts of over $ 400 billion. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, which has a $ 34 billion foreign debt, is the region's fourth-largest debtor `` This is a threat to our most elemental rights, against our democratic stability, and against our societies that want well-being and freedom,'' he said. <PERSON> Lusinchi </PERSON> earlier this month sent a financial mission to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to seek new debt financing. Venezuelan officials claim commercial bank creditors have reneged on a promise included in a 1987 partial debt refinancing to provide <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> with new funds and help it regain access to international financial markets. But despite recent rumors that <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> might declare a unilateral debt payment moratorium, <PERSON> Lusinchi </PERSON> and other top administration officials have said any suspension of payments would occur only if the financial mission failed and only in concert with commercial banks.
