 A convict serving a life sentence for drug smuggling and the helicopter pilot who tried to spring him from prison but crashed were charged Tuesday with conspiracy and attempted escape. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>, a nationally known powerboat racer serving a life sentence for marijuana smuggling, and sea-urchin diver <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, both 34, were charged Tuesday afternoon as they recuperated at <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> crashed Monday as his two-seater Bell helicopter snagged on a 14-foot wire security fence around the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> during an attempt to take <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> out of a recreation yard. <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> suffered a compound fracture to his left ankle and was listed in satisfactory condition. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, with two broken legs and injuries to the head, neck and back, was in good condition. A court appearance has not been scheduled yet. `` <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> started to take off from the compound with <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> hanging to the helicopter skids attempting to enter the cockpit,'' marshal <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Figmik </PERSON> wrote in the arrest affidavit. `` The helicopter's blades became entangled in a security fence and the helicopter crashed.'' Authorities say <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, who most recently lived on the <LOCATION> Oregan </LOCATION> coast, was an amateur pilot just learning to fly helicopters. In December, he paid $ 35,000 in cash for the chopper from a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> flight instructor and got four hours of flying instruction.

 Three <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> students have appealed the dismissal of their lawsuit against the college, which they claim discriminated against them because of their race and conservative beliefs, a lawyer said Tuesday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> last month dismissed a lawsuit filed by the three white students, who were suspended after a February 1988 classroom confrontation with <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, a black music professor. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quilhot </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, worked for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative off-campus weekly newspaper that had described <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> as part of `` <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION>'s Dynamic Duo of Mediocrity.'' They accused Cole of grabbing Quilhot by the arm and breaking the flash on his camera during the encounter, but a campus disciplinary board found them guilty of harassing Cole, and they were suspended in March 1988. `` It's in our best interest to go through with the appeal,'' <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> said Tuesday. The student's lawyer, <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said the three disagreed with <PERSON> Devine </PERSON>'s ruling that, even if the students demonstrated that they were treated unfairly because of their conservative politics and affiliation with the Review, they would not have a case under the racial discrimination statutes they cited. The appeal was filed Monday in the 1st U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sutter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> successfully sued the school in state court to have their suspensions lifted in December, but <PERSON> Sutter </PERSON> dropped out last month, four months before he was to graduate. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohl </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sutter </PERSON> reinstated on the ground that one member of the panel that disciplined them had been biased against the Review.

<HEAD>Principal Vetoes Article About Pregnant Valedictorian</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A high school principal has pulled a story from the school newspaper about the senior class valedictorian, a straight-A honors student who is pregnant with her second child. <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, principal of <ORGANIZATION> Jack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, vetoed an article by a student reporter about <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mae </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, who is five months pregnant and carries a full load of classes, including physics, calculus and economics. The story, titled `` Against all odds ... Student becomes valedictorian despite motherhood,'' details Miss <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s first pregnancy, how she was shuffled among relatives after her mother died and her stepfather deserted her and eight siblings, and her dream of a `` middle-class home and a middle-class life.'' Miss <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, who spends two to five hours a night with her books, has no one to baby-sit her 18-month-old daughter, <PERSON> Terrisha </PERSON> <PERSON> KeAndrea </PERSON>. She keeps the child occupied with paper and a pencil, and `` she writes while I write.'' Miss <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, 17, has been accepted to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> and has two scholarships. She plans to major in chemical engineering. A school reporter first tried to do a story about Miss <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> last year after she was spotted on a cold, rainy day standing at a bus stop, holding an umbrella over her daughter, while studying a math text. A school official blocked the story. According to newspaper editor <PERSON> Shuronda </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> rejected the story Thursday when she submitted the newspaper for approval. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday that he thought the article was too personal to be printed in the newspaper, and <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> Superintendent <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> agreed. `` In his judgment, the article was too highly personal, sensitive to the young lady, and he did not permit it to be published,'' she said. `` I have read the article myself, and I will further tell you that I would have made the same decision.'' Miss <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said the newspaper staff offered to edit the story to satisfy <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, but the offer was rejected. He also rejected a request to run a blank space or the word `` censored'' in place of the story. Although Miss <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> has worried the school officials will bar her from giving her valedictory address on graduation night June 10, Ms. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> said she will be allowed to speak and participate in any graduation activity.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> for the first time has sent arms to guerrillas fighting <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, newspapers today quoted a senior Thai officer as saying. The shipments are going to the forces of Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, president of the three-party guerrilla coalition, said Gen. <PERSON> Sunthorn </PERSON> <PERSON> Kongsompong </PERSON>, the armed forces chief of staff. The latest shipment arrived a few days ago, <PERSON> Sunthorn </PERSON> was quoted as saying Tuesday, according to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bangkok </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, Thai <PERSON> Rath </PERSON> and other newspapers. The arms are being shipped through Thai territory to the guerrillas on the Thai-Cambodian border, the newspapers said. The reports said <PERSON> Sunthorn </PERSON> dismissed concerns the aid may affect <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s plan to and withdraw all its troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by Sept. 30, ending a 10-year military occupation. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has demanded a simultanous halt in outside military aid to the guerrillas. <PERSON> Sunthorn </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s main source of foreign aid, will continue to pressure <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> for a pullout. The resistance receives the bulk of its weapons from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

 Put some racy, glittery commercials with lots of naked bodies on movie screens in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the audience goes wild. But do the same thing in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ with the glitz but without the nudity _ and the ads go over as big as sticky floors, stale popcorn and overpriced candy. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodderidge </PERSON>, senior vice president for corporate marketing at <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, said when <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> tried the ads in theaters, audiences went beserk. `` There was public displeasure indicated by throwing popcorn boxes at the screen and people wanting their money back,'' he said. `` They left home to avoid commercial television. They paid money and expected relief.'' `` I've been in theaters where people booed,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lippert </PERSON>, advertising critic for Ad Week magazine. `` On paper they sound great ... but they can only be successful if they're really artfully done and surprising.'' In <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, audiences get about 30 minutes of commercials, which must by law be 90 percent entertainment. In American theaters, though, audiences who are often asked to pay as much as $ 10 a ticket, resent the intrusion. The ads would have more staying power if they helped lower ticket prices, said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, senior vice president of sales and marketing for <ORGANIZATION> Modern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Talking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, which distributes corporate-sponsored films. He recalled a recent movie outing with his family in which he paid $ 22 for four tickets _ after a $ 50 dinner check. `` If I'd have sat there and seen a commercial I'd have been peeved.'' `` Nobody likes commercials,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Laughren </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Screenvision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-based </LOCATION> company that distributes commercials. `` But there's a tremendous fascination in this country for good advertising.'' The clutter of commercials on television has been one force behind the advertisers' quest for a more captive audience. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 7-Up, Dr Pepper, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> jeans, <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, Memorex and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION>, have reeled out dollars to give movie advertising a try. `` It seems to be growing pretty steadily,'' said <PERSON> Larissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON>, vice president of <LOCATION> Screenvision </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` With TV, what you are trying to do is talk through clutter to get some attention. There's no chance to get the emotional aspects of the product.'' Creators insist the ads are distinctly different from typical TV commercials, and some of them can be edited for television. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Danzer </PERSON>, national advertising manager for <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>, said the directors hired to do the ads often have experience with feature films and stunts such as car chases. He refused to divulge how much <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> spends on theater ads. One of <LOCATION> Screenvision </LOCATION>'s most recent commercials features <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is hard to find anybody who reacts negatively,'' said <PERSON> Laughren </PERSON> about the ad. `` To the concept, yes, there is negative reaction, but then they say, ` Oh god! That was a great commercial.''' In the <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> ad, which <PERSON> Danzer </PERSON> likens to the adventure formula of `` Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' a man dreams he's being chased through a jungle in his <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> four-wheeler by an imaginary threat. There's no dialogue until he wakes up, looks out his window and sees his <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> sitting outside. Then an announcer says: `` Toyota's new V64X4 Get it ... before it gets you.'' <PERSON> Danzer </PERSON> did n't know if the ads helped sales, but he said they were especially good at reaching males 18 to 34 years old, who are typically light TV viewers. `` In the theater 95 percent of the people see your ad,'' <PERSON> Danzer </PERSON> said. `` They might be eating popcorn, but they see the ad. With television you have no idea whether they are going to look at it.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernacchi </PERSON>, a professor of marketing at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION>, has studied theater advertising and thinks companies increasingly will want to see their products featured on the big screen. `` Right now it's an outstanding way to communicate with consumers,'' he said. `` Viewers will tend to ... receive them with more interest and maybe chagrin. They may reject them in their hearts, but they are probably going to stay in the saddle and witness them.'' The reason is a moviegoer's state of mind. <PERSON> Bernacchi </PERSON> said the expectation is much different when people actually seek entertainment. `` Few people go to the movies with the idea of just sitting and casually attending. You go there with a purpose,'' he said. <PERSON> Bernacchi </PERSON> thinks the ads will thrive because in theaters there is much less competition for a viewer's attention, and because the cinema, unlike VCRs, do n't offer the option of hand-held controls. However, some theater chain executives are less optimistic. They say reaction from audiences has been so overwhelmingly negative they risked losing business if they did n't pull the ads. `` We've tried it from time to time in different parts of the country,'' said <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> regional manager for General Cinema. `` The company felt the good will between the patrons and the company was somewhat compromised, and we valued the good will of the patrons more than running the ads.'' <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dodderidge </PERSON> said they were n't aware of any plans by their respective companies to try the ads again, but that's not to say their theaters are without commercials. Both General Cinema and <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> feature ads on slides. `` The slides are very low key,'' said <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Katcher </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> district manager for <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION>. `` You do n't have to watch them if you do n't want to. Nobody complains about them.''

 Many Japanese workers transferring to their companies' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> branches have a problem: American schools do n't prepare their children for the tough competition to get into a Japanese university. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s solution _ and a testament to the growing Japanese presence in this country _ is <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meiji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gakuin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, which will be the first fully accredited Japanese high school in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> when it opens May 10. `` Our goal is to give education to the children of overseas assigned business people,'' though the first class of 25 includes only one student whose family lives in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said director <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON>. `` Although we said it will be for American-based people, it will be two to four years before we have enough enrollment to operate that way,'' <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> said. He said families in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> may have been more familiar with the parent school, <ORGANIZATION> Meiji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gakuin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, than workers already in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Nothing is more important to Japanese families than the education of their children,'' said former Gov. <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> and scheduled keynote speaker for the opening. `` College entrance is very competitive and determined almost exclusively by results. `` If they fall behind while they're in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, that is a very dramatic problem for a Japanese family.'' Owned and operated by the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> university with the support of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, the coed school will open with grades 10, 11 and 12 on the Japanese school year, April through March with 250 days of class. School was to start Saturday, but students and teachers ran into problems getting visas, <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> said. `` I think maybe because this is the first Japanese high school, -LRB- immigration officials -RRB- are carefully handling reviewing this matter.'' Sending a student to <ORGANIZATION> TMG </ORGANIZATION>, as it's called, will cost about $ 19,000 a year. `` It may be more expensive than some can afford, but many send kids to colleges that are quite expensive,'' <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> said. `` I also think some companies will begin to subsidize overseas education. That need is more and more confirmed by both the people of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the government.'' The academic life will be pretty restrictive, he said. `` They will have to check out of the dorms if they want to leave. And they will have a lot of study requirements that will take a lot of their time.'' But the students, expected to number around 200 within two years, will be encouraged to take advantage of being in another country. They will go to class six days a week, as in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, but the sixth day will be for outside activities. `` The students will certainly have a lot of contact with the community,'' <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> said. `` The students can do regular high school studies, plus have such a valuable experience as living in this country.'' For <LOCATION> Sweetwater </LOCATION>, a town of 5,310 between <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, it could be sort of a stay-at-home cultural exchange program. `` It will be a culture shock both ways, for the Japanese coming here and for the community. Their philosophies of education and living are different, so I think it will be an educational experience for all of us,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Sweetwater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Meiji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gakuin </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 2.4 million for 144 rolling acres and 13 buildings, including two gymnasiums, a library and three dormitories that can house a total of 220 students. It spent $ 1.5 million on renovation. <ORGANIZATION> TMG </ORGANIZATION> recruited in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and hired 12 teachers, four of whom _ two single people and a married couple _ will live on campus. The teachers will be paid what their counterparts in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are paid. `` There were many applications for every subject,'' <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, who as governor from 1979-1987 heavily recruited Japanese businesses, said the school `` could be a magnet for industry, and I think it will be a wonderful thing for our own educational system because it will give us a basis for comparison. I think it's healthy to have. It means we do n't have to go half way around the world to discover what the competition is doing.'' There are 71 Japanese-owned businesses in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> employing 12,600. The largest is the <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> truck plant in <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION>. Others include <ORGANIZATION> ACOM </ORGANIZATION>, which makes <ORGANIZATION> Panasonic </ORGANIZATION> electric components in <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>; <PERSON> Matsushita </PERSON>; and <ORGANIZATION> Komatsu </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> TMG </ORGANIZATION> will employ 12 people from <LOCATION> Sweetwater </LOCATION> and the surrounding area, eight of them full-time _ including two cooks. `` They are in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> said, `` So they should eat some American food. Spaghetti. Cheeseburgers.''

 After years of preaching racism and hatred, the Rev. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> has lost some of his fire and brimstone. At 71, he walks slowly and breathes with difficulty, still weak from a heart attack suffered two years ago while awaiting trial on charges of scheming to overthrow the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. Many followers of his white supremacist Aryan Nations church have been jailed, or scared off by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigations and publicity from civil rights organizations. But this aging `` Aryan warrior'' hangs onto his dream of an all-white homeland in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, seeking inspiration from an unlikely source _ skinheads. `` They're the last hope, the only hope, of the white race,'' he said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Where others see menacing young thugs who shave their heads and tattoo their bodies with swastikas, <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> sees the next torch-bearers of racism. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> is sponsoring the first national neo-Nazi skinhead conference here this weekend to mark the 100th birthday of <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>, on April 20. The meeting worries law officers and rights activists, who until recently were noting with satisfaction that membership in racist hate groups seemed to be declining nationwide. `` Now, with skinheads, you have a pool of violence-prone, ideologically sympathetic people who are being courted to join the mainstream of the right-wing movement,'' said <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, northwest regional director for the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. The Jewish group notes that many skinheads band together without racist motivation. Those who can be classified as neo-Nazis, however, number about 2,000 in 21 states, with the greatest concentrations in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, skinheads are awaiting trial in the death last November of an Ethiopian man, who was fatally beaten with a baseball bat. Another skinhead is accused of stabbing a black man in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>. Swastikas painted on synagogues and assaults on Jews, homosexuals and other minorities have additionally been linked to skinheads in the region <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> is not alone in courting skinheads. He's competing with groups such as the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> and the White Aryan Resistance, led by <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzger </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Fallbrook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` Until now, skinhead groups have been mostly autonomous and localized,'' <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said. `` Any network <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> puts together bears watching.'' The network-building was visible last week as <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> and his followers prepared for this weekend's conference at his northern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> compound, 20 wooded acres tucked away on a gravel road near the resort town of <LOCATION> Hayden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>. Two men hammered away in one of several rustic guest cabins. A barefoot young woman leaned over a long canvas banner, stenciling in `` Aryan Nations Now.'' Taking time for an interview in the compound's modest church, <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> resembled not at all the tough, urban youths he is wooing. Dressed in a sweater vest, wool slacks and loafers, the gray-haired, bi-focaled <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> played the part of a kindly country preacher. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> shrouds his racist message in religion, using scripture to support his claims of white supremacy. He conceded that Biblical quotations may turn off skinheads, not known for steady church attendance. Many skinheads listen to the racist lyrics of <PERSON> Skrewdriver </PERSON>, an industrial-grade British rock band. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> wishes they would listen to <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>. `` We want them to be able to think,'' he said. `` You ca n't think if you're listening to the hard-rock jungle beat.'' Despite the generation gap, <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> feels he offers something these alienated youths can understand: a call to power in the name of racial pride. `` The white male, through affirmative action, has been made a non-citizen,'' he said. `` This is why you have skinheads. They're beginning to wake up to the fact that they've been conquered and that the land their fathers bled and died for has been taken away. His little church in the pines has a guard tower that's higher than the steeple. Inside, sunlight filters through stained glass onto a huge Nazi flag. A poster showing a young man with an assault rifle exhorts, `` Join Us, Aryan Freedom Fighters.'' `` Kids like that kind of stuff _ it gives the idea that they're in battle,'' <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said, quickly adding that talk of battle was only talk <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> moved to <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> in 1973 and over the years built up a following based on his dream of a `` territorial imperative'' for whites. He considered the Northwest an ideal homeland: rural, conservative and lacking many blacks, Jews and other minorities. His dream was blocked not only by resistance from local authorities but also by the violence of his own followers. Some former members, impatient with waiting for revolution, formed a group known as The Order. The group's founder, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON>, died in a fiery shootout with <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents in 1984 on an island in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s Puget Sound. Ten Order members have been convicted of racketeering, and 12 more pleaded guilty to various crimes in a scheme that included murder, armored-car robberies and plots to overthrow the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. Two years ago, <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> and 14 other white supremacists were charged with plotting to overthrow the government. They were acquitted last April, but <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>'s arrest and the costly trial crippled his already-weakened organization. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said weekly church attendance, which once peaked at 60, now hovers around 40. Outside observers put the number even lower. An Aryan Nations computer billboard, once touted as a high-tech communications network for white supremacists, was discontinued after the computer was stolen, <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said. But just when his opponents figured he was washed up, <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> announced plans for this weekend's skinhead conference. At first, officials expected up to 250 skinheads, and <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> promised a march down the streets of nearby <ORGANIZATION> Coeur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> d'Alene </ORGANIZATION>. In the face of fierce opposition from locals, <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> backed off. He said he did n't want his supporters catching AIDS from counter-demonstrators. And now he says he's expecting just 75 to 100 skinheads. He's planning a weekend of lectures, karate workshops and campfire `` fellowship.'' He said lawyers will offer the skinheads tips on how to build power legally. `` I hope to keep them from going to prison or getting killed. They can do a lot more for the cause on the streets,'' <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said. `` I want them to become a political force. That can come when they have knowledge. When you have knowledge, you have power.'' The idea of a white homeland in the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> is little more than rhetoric bandied about by ideologues doomed by their own extremism and violence, said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Gissel </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Kootenai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Human Relations. The group is among several planning civil rights activities this week to counter the skinhead gathering. `` These people are their own worst enemies,'' <PERSON> Gissel </PERSON> said. `` Now they're down to a church that has about 10 members and a handful of kids.'' But <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> warns against writing off the racist cause. `` The old men like myself are going to die off very soon,'' he said. `` But this is the first time that I've seen a spirit of regeneration.''

 This quiet resort town may have been slow to recognize the racist threat of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>'s neo-Nazi sect, but civil rights leaders say their vigilance is now wide-eyed and alert. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> targeted the Northwest for an all-white <ORGANIZATION> Aryan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> homeland partly because of the region's conservative politics and tradition of tolerance. `` The Aryan Nations miscalculated,'' said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Malicious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harassment </ORGANIZATION>. `` They did not find acceptance in the Northwest.'' This week, as <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> prepares for a neo-Nazi skinhead conference at his compound a few miles from <ORGANIZATION> Coeur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> d'Alene </ORGANIZATION>, civic leaders in northern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> are planning a march, a picnic and an inter-faith church service to celebrate cultural diversity. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>'s activities did not always provoke such responses. His Aryan Nations church, established in 1973, was all but ignored for years. `` You have a lot of kooks and nuts anywhere you go,'' said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Gissel </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Kootenai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Human Relations. `` In north <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, especially, the sentiment is that you leave your neighbor alone if he wants to be left alone.'' That started to change in 1981, when swastikas appeared on a Jewish-owned restaurant in <LOCATION> Hayden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>. The task force was formed, but community participation remained low until 1985, when court trials revealed ties between <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>'s Aryan Nations and The Order, a violent group that masterminded murder, bombings and armed bank robberies. <ORGANIZATION> Coeur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> d'Alene </ORGANIZATION>'s live-and-let-live demeanor changed forever the morning of Sept. 29, 1986, when three bombs exploded in town, planted by white supremacists as a diversion during a foiled bank robbery. The next summer, when <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> held his annual <ORGANIZATION> Aryan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for about 200 white supremacist leaders, a civil rights rally in <ORGANIZATION> Coeur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> d'Alene </ORGANIZATION> drew 1,000 people. The task force on human relations has served as a model for about a dozen watchdog groups now operating in the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gissel </PERSON> said. The coalition <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> heads is another offshoot, monitoring hate crimes throughout the region. State lawmakers have also joined the fight against racism. `` <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> now has the most comprehensive anti-hate crime legislative package in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> is one of 18 states, and the only one in the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, with laws against paramilitary training. A `` malicious harassment'' law makes it a felony to assault someone on the basis of race, religion or ethnic background. And that law will be strengthened by another measure passed last month. It calls for an annual report on hate crimes and requires law officers investigating any crime to note whether harassment was involved. Civil rights leaders are confident the white supremacists will never find their `` promised land'' in the Northwest. But they do not plan to relax their vigilance. `` As long as they exist in any organized form, there is going to be harassment to people of color, Jews and other minority groups,'' <PERSON> Gissel </PERSON> said. `` We're going to do whatever we can to hasten the day when those types of activities cease to occur.''

<TEXT>
 A little-known early 16th-century German sculptor, <PERSON> Niclaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Weckmann </PERSON> the Elder, became a major figure in art history when a woodcarving of his sold at auction for $ 423,000, <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s said `` The price was a very high one for such a work,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Wrey </PERSON>, a spokesman for the auction house, after the sale Tuesday of the Weckmann's Adoration of the <ORGANIZATION> Magi </ORGANIZATION>. The seller was described only as a continental nobleman. The buyer was anonymous but <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Avery </PERSON>, the firm's head of sculpture, said the work `` may be going back to south <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which would be appropriate as that was <PERSON> Weckmann </PERSON>'s homeland.'' The limewood carving, more than five feet tall and four feet wide, was once part of an altarpiece and depicts the wise men presenting their gifts to the infant <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>. `` It had been in the private chapel of a noble family in <LOCATION> Styria </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> -RRB- for 100 years or so and probably no one else saw it,'' <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> said. `` If we knew where it had been for the 300 years before that it would been even more costly as a complete antique provenance adds to value,'' he said. <PERSON> Weckmann </PERSON> lived from about 1460 to 1520. His works were attributed to other artists until 1968, when he was identified as one of the greatest sculptors working in the town of Ulm around 1500. <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> said he was so impressed by the unsigned carving when it arrived for auction that he asked for a study of it from <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaedler </PERSON>, chief curator of sculpture at the National Bavarian Museum in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>. `` Schaedler is the expert on <LOCATION> Weckmann </LOCATION> and he attibuted it to him on grounds of style and type. It is one of the largest and most splendid pieces of Gothic German wood sculpture to be auctioned in recent times,'' <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> added. As nothing identified as <PERSON> Weckmann </PERSON>'s work had been auctioned before, <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s said they were uncertain how to estimate the carving's price, at first setting it at $ 172,000 and then thinking it might go up to $ 344,000.

 A Satanism expert is teaching police at a five-day seminar that has drawn about 80 participants to recognize signs of devil worship. The State Police-sponsored seminar on cults and the occult was planned before the discovery earlier this month of a ritual mass slaying blamed on drug smugglers in <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Even before that discovery, `` we had inquiries from law enforcement groups from throughout the state wanting to know if we had any seminars on the topic,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ducote </PERSON> said by telephone from <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, where the seminar is being held. `` There's a lot of interest. A lot of officers had read in the news media about areas with animal mutilations and such. They wanted some knowledge on how to recognize the signs,'' said <PERSON> Ducote </PERSON>. The five-day seminar, which began Monday and involves law enforcement officers from around the state, is taught by <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Wedge </PERSON>, author of `` The Satan Hunter.'' He has been a guest on several national television talk shows. `` I wanted to know the difference between fact and fiction, what's rumor and what's fact in what's occurring in Satanism,'' said Trooper <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>, a homicide investigator. `` I have felt that on two or three major crimes, there was a possiblity the suspects were involved in Satanism. I want to be able to go to a scene and tell,'' <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ducote </PERSON> said devil worship is not illegal. `` But most of the activity is a front for dealing in drugs,'' he said. Some ministers and businessmen recently announced plans to ask the Legislature to outlaw Satanism. Businessman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Huenefeld </PERSON>, a bankruptcy trustee from <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, said the interest in satanic worship stems from drugs and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s poor economy. `` I'm handling 600 bankruptcies and I can tell you the impact on the family unit,'' he said. `` The poor are looking for a way out and a few misguided ones are looking to these cults. And, drugs tend to get kids involved in these things.''

<TEXT>
 Israeli army officers serving in the occupied lands complain of feeling like `` stone fodder'' thrown into a futile battle with Palestinians and say settler and army brutality have corrupted <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s morals. `` I am reaching the end of my thoughts about Zionism in this country. My next war will be against Jews. That's what I feel,'' said one officer, <PERSON> Uri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>. His comments and those of 10 other reserve officers appear in `` Commanders' Reflections,'' a 34-page booklet published by the <PERSON> Kibbutz </PERSON> <PERSON> Artzi </PERSON> movement that unites 85 of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 160-odd kibbutzim, or communal farms. The booklet, released on Tuesday, quotes remarks made by the officers, members of kibbutzim, in a February conversation with Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Amram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON>, head of the army's central command. Their ranks were not given. The officers single out army regulations on opening fire, lack of proper ammunition, pressure of increased reserve duty and their feeling of futility in dealing with the Palestinian revolt. The 16-month uprising _ known to <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION> as the `` intefadeh'' _ in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> has claimed at least 439 Palestinian and 18 Israeli lives. `` Once in four, five months you are called to intefadeh, and you see that nothing has changed, maybe it only got worse. I can even say that ... in a certain way, you feel like stone fodder,'' said <PERSON> Omri </PERSON> <PERSON> Frish </PERSON> of the kibbutz Mesilot. Army rules on opening fire, which forbid troops to shoot live ammunition unless a danger to life exists, still `` leave the final, last and only consideration to the lonely soldier in a side alley,'' Frish said. <PERSON> Frish </PERSON> said that as to the alternative plastic or rubber bullets, these may be hard to find. `` The means we have at our disposal ... are very poor. A soldier asks his commander, why we have no rubber bullets, or helmets, or this, or that, and it's a problem,'' he said. Other officers criticized even the use of plastic bullets. <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ofer </PERSON> of kibbutz Maanit in central <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said rules allowing such bullets to be fired for riot dispersal were `` illegal.'' `` There are so-called ` plastic bullet ambushes.' One soldier provokes the residents, one of the duped residents hurls a stone, and another -LRB- soldier -RRB- is ready with a plastic bullet,'' said <PERSON> Dani </PERSON> <PERSON> Gal </PERSON> of the Kfar Menahem kibbutz. <PERSON> Elisha </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapira </PERSON> of <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashofet </PERSON> said he complained to army authorities who took action against two lieutenant-colonels posted in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the largest <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town. `` They engaged in manhunting ... they were just driving around, looking for a possibility to harm an Arab,'' <PERSON> Shapira </PERSON> said, without elaborating. Some officers said they reached a breaking point during night search-and - arrest raids `` I do n't think I can enter at 2 o'clock at night into a house where 10 small children are crying, and take people away, their father or somebody ... This is not my job, this is not what I was trained for in the army,'' said <PERSON> Yehiam </PERSON> <PERSON> Yogev </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Menahem </LOCATION>. `` I just can not do this.'' An army spokesman, asked for comment, said the military had `` no opposition to the expression of officers' opinion, as long as it's done by proper channels. He said no official statement on the booklet was expected. The spokesman, who commented anonymously in keeping with military rules, said that in specific cases, when the reservists `` see something that is not acceptable in society or in the framework of army rules, they can complain through the many existing channels, and many have done so.'' However, one senior officer indicated the army establishment was worried by the appearance of groups `` that used their military ranks for political statements.'' The booklet was especially painful for the military. Although <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s kibbutz movement is traditionally leftist, many of its members volunteer for service in elite army units, seeing it as a supreme value. The booklet also contains strong attacks on some of the 70,000 Jewish settlers living in the occupied territories among 1.7 million Palestinians. `` We have encountered ... several events in which the settlers took the law in their hands, made a real pogrom, beat the Arabs,'' said one participant, identified only as <PERSON> Yair </PERSON>. Others spoke of the existence of armed settler militias. `` I know these exist. I personally spoke to a man who told me he was organizing 40 boys with ammunition belts and radios, so they respond properly,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, of Nir Oz kibbutz. The commanders said they opposed refusal to serve in the occupied territories, but expressed fear about the implications of the continuing conflict there on the army and on <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> society as a whole. `` They make us kill them. The Jewish people will not be able to withstand this,'' said <PERSON> Elie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Gal </PERSON> of <PERSON> Baram </PERSON>. `` I am telling you, they will not be able to withstand this.''

 Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> is urging Californians to listen to their mothers. The governor joined <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holt </ORGANIZATION>, the mothers of actors <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>, in kicking off a campaign on Tuesday to promote ride sharing and van-pool programs to help unclog freeways. But he was a little late because of traffic congestion. The campaign will feature the theme of rather universal motherly sayings. One advertisement depicts a woman who says: `` We're not the first one to try to talk some sense into you about sharing.'' Other celebrity moms taking part include <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, mother of comic <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, mother of <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lakers </ORGANIZATION> basketball star <PERSON> Earvin </PERSON> `` Magic'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. `` Your mother, as this -LRB- campaign -RRB- says, always told you to share and it was good advice then and I think it's very good advice now, and it's going to help us to meet our transportation challenges,'' <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> said <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is the sixth-largest economic power in the world but each day workers lose about 400,000 hours of productivity while stuck in traffic. Last year, 22.4 million vehicles were in the state and there will be 23.8 million by the century's end. There is an average of 1.2 persons per vehicle in peak hours, but congestion could be eliminated if that improved to just 1.4 per vehicle, <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> said.

 State Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Swain </PERSON> got little attention when he introduced a bill to designate an official state dog, but now the `` Plott'' has thickened.

 The Missouri <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed a bill making the 250-million-year-old remains of a plantlike animal the official state fossil.

He said he was concerned the headlines would read, `` <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> spends afternoon making spineless wimp the state fossil.'' But the bill's sponsor, Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, called the measure an important civics lesson for an eighth-grade science class in his district that first proposed it. `` Now they've seen an idea from their classroom go through both chambers for a possible signing by the governor,'' he said. Crinoids, commonly known as sea lillies, flourished 250 million years ago when most of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> was covered by shallow seas. They are found throughout the state, mainly in limestone deposits.

<HEAD>Closed Lab told To Pay For Millions Of New Pap Tests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 State health officials ordered a laboratory to offer to pay for repeat Pap smear tests for more than 3 million women diagnosed as cancer-free after learning the lab's error rate was greater than 20 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pathology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Tarzana </LOCATION>, which has performed 3.3 million Pap smears over the past five years, was ordered closed last week after a state audit showed an error rate of 21.2 percent among 1,103 tests selected at random. `` It was a sloppy operation,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kizer </PERSON>, state health services director. `` It was totally unacceptable that they had such a high error rate.'' The lab, which also worked under the name <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diagnostic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, processed nearly 700,000 smears last year, more than half of all of the tests in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Pap smears from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> were processed at the company's <LOCATION> Tarzana </LOCATION> area lab. In its order delivered to the lab Monday, the health department said all women in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and other states who had received reports indicating no abnormalities from either Central Pathology or Central Diagnostic within the last five years needed to be offered the opportunity for a repeat Pap smear. The lab, which closed Monday, was given 30 days to contact the women and recommend they see their doctors about retaking the tests elsewhere. Central Pathology said in a statement it was `` a 27-year-old facility with a perfect inspection record to this point'' and that it had recently instituted what it called `` the most stringent quality-control standards in the nation.'' The Pap smear, which costs about $ 25, is a routine test used to detect cervical cancer and other medical abnormalities. The industry average for misdiagnosing Pap smears is about 5 percent, but some pathologists said top labs make even fewer mistakes. <PERSON> Kizer </PERSON> said state officials plan to inspect 10 other Pap smear laboratories within the next six weeks. He did not identify them. `` We need to get an idea of the other labs' error rates and set some kind of standard,'' <PERSON> Kizer </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Manilow </PERSON>, master of the big ballad, brought his talent for showmanship to <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> on Tuesday night for a month-long engagement. Mixing show-biz sophistication with pure corn, `` <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Manilow </PERSON> at the Gershwin'' is strong entertainment. The production is sleek, with costumed backup singers and projections on the back wall. <PERSON> Manilow </PERSON> inserts a rock beat in a few numbers, tackles the Motown sound a couple of times, and does one superfast <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendricks </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> jazz number, `` Cloudburst,'' that he admired early. Though he's no slouch with those styles, the lengthy romantic ballad, given a big buildup to an emotional finish, is his strongest suit. He started the second half of the evening with three new songs of that type, pointing up once again that his style is grounded in a performance tradition older than rock. In an autobiographical portion of the show, the singer-pianist picked up the accordion, which he said he learned -LRB- and hated -RRB- at age 11, two years before he learned piano. In front of a set representing the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> apartment where he grew up, he demonstrated that even <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>'s `` Born in the U.S.A.'' sounds old-fashioned on an accordion. He also talked about being a pianist for singers auditioning for Broadway, but did n't mention his hitch as musical director on <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Midler </PERSON>'s 1973 tour, after which he got a recording deal and had his first hit, `` <PERSON> Mandy </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Manilow </PERSON> ended the evening with a medley of many hits, including `` One Voice,'' `` The Old Songs,'' `` I Do n't Want To Walk without You,'' `` <LOCATION> Copacabana </LOCATION>,'' `` This One's for You,'' `` Tryin' To Get the Feeling Again,'' `` It's a Miracle,'' `` Somewhere in the Night,'' and `` I Write the Songs.''

<HEAD>Air Pollution Bill Aims at Broader Variety of Toxics</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sponsors of a compromise bill to control airborne toxic chemicals say they expect stiff opposition, despite growing information on poisons in the nation's air. `` This bill will be critized by some for going too far, and by others who do n't think it has gone far enough,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said Tuesday after he and 11 other senators introduced the legislation. The bipartisan and diverse group said their language remains subject to hard bargaining, but emphasized they have a consensus on how to control the estimated 2.7 billion pounds of poisonous chemicals released into the atmosphere each year. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, in its first such compilation, said April 12 that the toxic air emissions are among more than 22 billion pounds of toxic wastes sent into the air, water and land each year. The legislation to control toxic emissions into the atmosphere represents a major compromise for lawmakers pushing for new clean air legislation this year. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> clean air sponsors said they will introduce the other components of their legislation in coming months: proposals to bring metropolitan areas in compliance with air quality standards, and language to control acid rain. The air toxics compromise would require companies emitting 10 tons or more of any airborne toxic chemical to install the best available control technology. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> would set emissions standards for industries releasing the chemicals. But to encourage polluters to make immediate and large-scale reductions, they would be granted exemptions if they used technology that achieves a 90 percent cutback in emissions by the end of 1992. If technology did not achieve the required reduction, a company would have to meet tough emissions limits based on a chemical's risk of causing cancer or other illnesses The legislation would replace a system that has regulated only seven toxic chemicals out of nearly 300 emitted into the air. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> is currently required to assess the risk of each chemical, and then develop chemical-by-chemical emissions standards designed to protect public health, with an ample margin of safety. The assessment for each chemical takes several years. And when the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has made proposals, the agency has been sued on grounds it went too far _ or not far enough. The bill also would direct <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to establish a national urban air toxics program to reduce the release of toxic chemicals from motor vehicles, wood stoves, dry cleaners and gas stations. In a provision to prevent catastrophic accidents, the bill would require <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to list 50 extremely hazardous substances. Facilities handling those materials would have to complete reviews to identify potential accidents. A <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> would be established to investigate accidents and make recommendations for preventive measures. Sen. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., the manager of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> clean air legislation this year, told reporters, `` There is a public health crisis that will worsen if we do n't act. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Barks </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, said the environmental groups in the organization believe the bill needs improvements. He said that under the bill the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> could take between five and 13 years to set standards for emission reduction for polluters who fail to qualify for the exemption. That timetable is too long, he said. Announcing the compromise were Sens. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, R-Minn.; <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Quentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>, D-Conn., and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>

 Small communities like Gallup, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Greenwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, should flourish in coming years as people flee both big cities and suburbs while businesses seek out new markets, says population researcher <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. Although attention and headlines focus on the major metropolitan areas, `` micropolitan'' <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> may become increasingly popular, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> says in the May edition of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Demographics </ORGANIZATION>, a magazine focusing on population issues. `` An increasing number of people are growing tired of central cities where crime rates are getting out of sight,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said Tuesday in a telephone interview. `` In the suburbs as well, housing prices are getting extremely high, schools are crowded, people are showing an interest in getting away to areas where they have more control of their lives.'' `` Smaller cities are as influential in their regions as metropolitan areas are on a larger scale,'' reported <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, who operates the research firm <ORGANIZATION> Niagara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Concepts </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tonawanda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, a suburb of <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> defines a micropolitan area as a county with a population of at least 40,000 people, with a core city including at least 15,000 _ but not a part of a metropolitan area. Metropolitan areas, which are officially designated by the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, are economically related counties generally focusing on a central city of 50,000 people or more. He reports that between 1980 and 1986 some 83 micropolitan areas grew faster than the nation as a whole. That amounted to 38 percent of micropolitan areas, he said. In the same period 45 percent of the larger metropolitan areas were growing faster than the national rate. Many of these communities are already showing their popularity. Leading the small city growth was <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, which increased by 48.6 percent over the six years. Helping was that city's nearness to fast-growing <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> reports. Like metropolitan areas, the fastest growing micropolitans tended to benefit from Sun Belt locations. Indeed, of eight that increased by more than 25 percent over the six years, seven were in the Sun Belt.

<HEAD>Positive Outlook Promotes Killer Cell Activity, Studies Show</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A positive outlook on life appears to promote natural killer cell activity for fighting disease in certain cancer patients as well as healthy individuals, according to studies presented today. `` It does n't seem to be so much whether one is exposed to stress or not, but how people are reacting to similar types of stress,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Herberman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and part of the research team. `` If they're not as well adjusted ... we have indication that it has health consequences.'' <PERSON> Herberman </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, an associate director at the institute, say they have found that colon and skin cancer patients who combine standard medical care with psychotherapy have higher natural killer cell activity than those who do not undergo counseling. In a separate study being presented at a medical symposium at <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, they said healthy people with positive outlooks have higher natural killer cell activity than physically fit complainers. The upbeat subjects suffered fewer colds and other viral infections. Their ailments also did not last as long as illnesses suffered by those expressing `` more hostility and anger about their life,'' said <PERSON> Herberman </PERSON>, who followed the subjects for six months. These findings, based on an analysis of 120 men and women between ages 18 and 45, confirm the results of a smaller pilot study conducted by <PERSON> Herberman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> three years ago at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` We were looking at how serious the stresses were to them ... their hassles, things that happen to all of us, fights with the boss, that kind of thing,'' <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said in an interview Tuesday night. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Zabora </PERSON>, director of patient and family services for the <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oncology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and the symposium's co-director, called the findings `` interesting'' but said they must be kept in perspective `` They're moving into a very difficult area,'' <PERSON> Zabora </PERSON> said. `` The immune system is an incredibly complicated system and maybe to this point in time we have examined 1 percent or 0.5 percent of what the immune system is all about.'' Researchers currently can only speculate why happiness seems to promote activity of natural killer cells, which comprise 5 percent to 10 percent of all white blood cells, according to <PERSON> Herberman </PERSON>. One theory is that a positive perception of stress produces certain hormones that affect the body's immune system. `` It is n't clear what's going on,'' <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said. `` All we're asking is whether behavior or central nervous system-mediated factors play some role for some tumors If they do, that's important because behavior can be changed. To test that notion, <PERSON> Herberman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodin </PERSON>, professor of psychiatry at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, followed 30 people between ages 18 and 45 with colon cancer or malignant melanomas. All had had their tumors surgically removed, and the disease had not reached advanced stages. Eighteen received individual counseling once a week for eight weeks. The remaining 12 received only standard medical care. Both groups were identical in background. By the end of psychotherapy, the 18 with counseling showed significantly higher natural killer cell activity than those without, <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said. The counseled group reported less depression and anger and seemed better able to cope with their lives, she said. The 12 who did not undergo psychotherapy tended to blame themselves for their problems, <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said. `` We do n't believe ... that your psychological status is going to make the difference as far as whether the disease is present or not,'' <PERSON> Herberman </PERSON> said. `` But on top of all the physical issues, the nature of the disease and the body's immune response to it, the psychological factors can have a significant effect.'' Additional studies are needed before any recommendations can be made regarding psychotherapy. `` Time will tell as to how much that is going to make a difference as far as survival or staying tumor-free,'' <PERSON> Herberman </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Bush Says Spring Payments Will be Faster, Other Programs Face Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says farmers who signed up in this year's crop programs will soon get speeded-up payments totaling about $ 850 million to help them with spring planting. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also warned Tuesday that `` perilous budget-deficit times'' will mean cuts in other farm programs. He did not say what other cuts may be involved. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> participated in a telephone interview program with a group of farm broadcasters. The president said he authorized the acceleration of price-support payments `` to provide some extra money to farmers early in the crop year.'' The $ 850 million in payments will be made after May 15 to producers of wheat, feed grains, rice and cotton who signed up in the 1989 programs and requested advance payments. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the speeded-up payments show that `` we are with the American farmer in these tough times,'' a principal goal of the change is to reduce the red ink in his fiscal 1990 budget. The payments now shift the $ 850 million out of fiscal 1990, which begins on Oct. 1, and into the current fiscal year. About $ 3.13 billion in advance payments were already paid to farmers during the program signup period, which ended on April 14. The $ 850 million will be on top of those advances. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, putting on headphones in a small <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> broadcast booth, answered questions from agricultural broadcasters for about 15 minutes. The program was sent out over the agency's agricultural radio network. The president also announced creation of a working group on rural development to be headed by <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>. He said the group would evaluate existing federal rural-development programs and make recommendations. `` Events such as last year's drought reinforce the need to develop and diversify the rural economy in the years ahead,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The price announcement made by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> makes an additional 10 percent available to farmers in so-called advance deficiency payments. Tuesday's action raised the size of advance payments wheat and feed-grain farmers can collect from 40 percent to 50 percent, and the share rice and cotton farmers can collect in advance from 30 percent to 40 percent. The advances are against anticipated government subsidies to help farmers recover the difference between market prices and federally set target prices. One interviewer asked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> how he reconciled heavy cuts in farm programs under the budget compromise recently negotiated by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> with his campaign vow not to balance the budget on farmer's back. `` We are in perilous budget-deficit times. We've got to get the deficit down. And the best thing we can do to help the American farmer is to get these interest rates down. And the best way to do that is to make the tough decision on the spending side of our budget,'' he said. `` Yes, ` ag' is taking a hit. But so is a wide array of programs across the board.'' Asked if the speedup in payments would be the sum total of federal help for producers who are being hurt by the drought gripping <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and much of the winter wheat area, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` This should not be viewed as the definitive answer. We hope it is something that will help the farm family.'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> added: `` Clearly we do n't have an open spigot that just spits out federal dollars in any situation today. But we'll be as sympathetic and as accommodative as we can be within rather severe budgetary restraints.'' After <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> left to return to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> continued taking questions from the broadcasters. Asked about reports that the government's program to subsidize exports of wheat and other farm commodities is being scuttled, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said no such plan is in the works. However, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> reiterated that the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s Export Enhancement Program, or <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, will come under review. But no <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> allocations now in effect will be curtailed, he said. The program provides subsidies to private exporters for the sale of designated commodities to specific countries at reduced prices. The object is to make <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products competitive with those from other foreign suppliers, notably the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. `` All that is at issue at the moment is any future allocations that might be made'' under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, he said. Those will be considered on a case-by-case basis `` primarily because of our stocks -LRB- of grain -RRB- condition and the weather conditions that now prevail.'' Some consumer advocates have urged cancellation of <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> because drought-reduced production last year helped trigger a heavy drain on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain stockpiles. Moreover, with drought persisting in some areas, particularly in parts of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> wheat belt, there is much uncertainty about 1989 production.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is being pressured by two senators to investigate whether the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration failed to turn over documents detailing secret arrangements to help the Contras, including <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s involvement. The White House said Tuesday that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had made the documents `` available'' in 1987, but did not specifically say whether they had been turned over to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The documents, which emerged at <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s criminal trial, spell out President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s approval of a deal in which <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> got more than $ 110 million in extra <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid as payment for supporting the Contras in 1985. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> informed the Honduran president of the extra aid, but it is n't clear whether the then-U.S. vice president knew the assistance was a payoff for Contra backing. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has refused to comment on what he knew. `` We address this letter to you personally to underscore the gravity of the matter if there has been, in fact, a failure to produce these documents to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' said the letter, released Tuesday. It was written the previous day by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, and Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Contra </ORGANIZATION> committee and <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> was a member. `` We respectfully request that you direct an immediate and thorough investigation and report to determine whether any documents were not provided to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>,'' stated the letter. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> responded Tuesday that all documents identified in the letter from <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> `` were available to the independent counsel and the Iran-contra investigating committee.'' He added that `` all such documents related to the Iran-contra case were certainly accessible to the independent counsel, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION>, and the Iran-contra committee.'' The congressional Iran-Contra committees uncovered third-country support for the Contras, but it did n't turn up the quid pro quo arrangements which helped secure the foreign Contra backing. The Honduran deal was part of a secret approach the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration made to at least 11 countries in which it sought help for the rebel force due to a congressional cutoff in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid. Another document sought by the senators describes <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s apparent approval of airdropping intelligence and rifles to the Contras to destroy arms-bearing ships headed for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> The document, dated Oct. 30, 1985, also concerns reconnaissance overflights of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Another document sought by <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> spells out <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s phone call to Honduran President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON> which resulted in the release of a Contra-bound arms shipment the Honduran military had seized. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> also asked for `` other documents related to these matters.'' Documents on <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> which emerged at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial describe how the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration conditioned extra aid to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> on Contra support and the lengths to which the administration went to keep such arrangements secret from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. An interagency Crisis Pre-Planning Group on Feb. 7, 1985, approved an agreement under which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would send a letter to the <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> president urging Contra support and offering several inducements. The enticements included speeded-up deliveries of military supplies, release of economic assistance and <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> support. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s letter urging <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> support was to be followed by the visit of an emissary who would orally outline the conditions attached to the extra aid. The <ORGANIZATION> CPPG </ORGANIZATION> did n't want to include the detail of the quid pro quo arrangement in writing. North and <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> staffer <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Burghardt </PERSON> subsequently became concerned over how the plan was to be carried out. There was to be no special emissary conditioning the extra aid on Contra support. Instead, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON> was to deliver the text of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s letter and to take a softer approach, saying that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had directed extra assistance. `` To date, all administration officials have been able to state to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that we have not approached any other government to support the resistance,'' North and <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> colleague <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Burghardt </PERSON> said in a Feb. 20, 1985, memo. The memo to then-national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> is one of the documents the two senators want included in a review by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. If the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s approach is carried out, `` we will no longer be able to make such a claim and any of the appropriate committees may place a call for all relevant cables on this matter at any time,'' said the memo. `` <PERSON> Amb </PERSON> <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON>, who will be called upon to testify during his confirmation hearings for assistant secretary, will undoubtedly be queried on whether or not such overtures were made to the Hondurans.'' The North-Burghardt memo said that `` notwithstanding our own interpretations'' of the <LOCATION> Boland </LOCATION> amendment cutting off military aid to the Contras `` it is very clear from the colloquy during the debate ... that the legislative intent was to deny any direct or indirect support for the military-paramilitary operations in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' The amendment had gone into effect in October 1984. `` In short, the decision to proceed without an emissary places both <ORGANIZATION> Amb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Negroponte </ORGANIZATION> and our hopes with the Hill at increased jeopardy. We still believe that our original concept of an emissary is the proper way in which to proceed.'' North and <PERSON> Burghardt </PERSON> apparently prevailed. <PERSON> North </PERSON> wrote a followup memo on Feb. 25, 1985, saying that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s signed letter urging <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> support `` will be delivered'' to <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON> by <PERSON> Burghardt </PERSON>.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is exercising one prerogative of being president: changing his mind. But when a president changes his mind, the ramifications can be far-reaching and sometimes costly. For instance, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned to spend last weekend at his vacation home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. He was to make a four-day event of it, with education speeches in <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, on the way up and in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, on the way back. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> delivered the speech in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> on Thursday, but scrubbed the long vacation weekend in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> so he could be on hand for Friday's unveiling of a budget compromise with congressional leaders. Then he added a new destination for Monday, scrapping upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Hamtramck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, where he announced a package of economic incentives for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. White House aides wanted a locale with a large Polish-American population, and <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> did n't quite fit the bill. Canceling the <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> trip meant dozens of reserved hotel rooms _ obtained by <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides, security agents and reporters _ had to be ditched at the last minute, and a fleet of five dozen rental cars returned. It also meant elaborate advance and security preparations in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was to visit an Eastman Kodak plant and speak at a school, went for naught. `` The White House goes where the president goes,'' said presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. Last month, a planned trip to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and other Western states was scheduled, then postponed and finally canceled. Now, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> trip is on again _ but in modified form, for later this month. In the meantime, another <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> trip scheduled for May 5-6 was scrapped. And, a presidential visit to <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, site of last December's <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 disaster, was penciled onto the president's itinerary for his four-nation European trip in May, then suddenly taken off. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flip-flops, of course, include more than trips. On semiautomatic assault rifles, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> initially said he opposed any attempts to control or restrict them. But he later moved to suspend imports of these weapons. Then, he tightened that ban, angering congressional gun-control opponents in the process, amid hints that the administration would come out with permanent new restrictions on both domestic and foreign-produced assault weapons. He admitted to `` a pulse change'' on the subject of gun control. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also did an about-face on federal involvement in cleanup operations in the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil spill, first praising <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> for the job it was doing and voicing opposition to a federal takeover; then moving a week later to put one in effect. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also executed a turnabout on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> funds for the Nicaraguan Contras. First he echoed the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration position favoring continuing military support for the anti-government rebels. But he wound up going along with a bipartisan agreement sharply scaling back <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the Contras. He also has seemed to come down on both sides of the issue of tuition tax credits. When a student at a White House session on March 29 asked him if the parents of a child in private school should get a federal tax credit for the tuition they pay, he said, `` No, they should n't.'' But he told a group of conservatives and evangelical Christians this week that he supports the idea of tuition tax credits, although budget constraints prevent him from proposing one at this time. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s flips and shifts prompted <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> political cartoonist <PERSON> Herblock </PERSON> to depict him as a gaunt figure atop a weathervane, flopping one way then the other, a finger jutting up to catch the shifting winds of public opinion. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, after all, is the president. And there's no prohibition against changing his mind, either on trips or on issues. And kinder and gentler only goes so far. `` If you're too polite in life, you get stomped on,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a youngster who was hesitant in raising her hand at a question-and-answer session at the White House.

 Rain, lightning and 125 years have taken such a toll on the giant bronze Statue of Freedom atop the Capitol dome that it will be removed _ probably by helicopter _ and restored, the Capitol architect says. The operation will leave a large hole in the top of the lantern which supports the statue on top of the dome. The hole will be fitted with a temporary cover to keep out rain during the six-month long, $ 250,000 restoration project, according to Architect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. But <PERSON> White </PERSON> said the iron dome itself is in excellent condition and needs no major repairs. The 14,985-pound figure which rises 19 feet six inches from the top of the soaring dome is a symbolic cast-bronze image of a female warrior draped in flowing robes and clasping a sheathed sword. It has been a Capitol symbol since its head, the last of five sections, was hoisted aloft and bolted in place on Dec. 2, 1863. `` It has n't been touched since that time,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. `` When we had the dome repainted last summer we confirmed that the statue is in very serious condition.'' White said cracks had developed in some of the interior fastenings of the statue and that an exterior chunk of its robes fell out last year. The statue consists of five separate pieces of cast bronze bolted together and attached to a cast-iron base. `` The whole thing is in really bad condition,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. `` Bronze does deteriorate.'' In preparation for removing the statue a protective cage will be built around it, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said and added: `` We'll probably take it down by helicopter.'' The project could begin soon although no firm date has been set. The statue is the finishing flourish of the soaring dome which was completed during the middle of the Civil War. Although the iron of which it is crafted could have been used for the war effort, President <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> ordered work on the dome to continue as a symbol that the national union of states was also continuing. Many of the 15 million tourists who see the statue from a distance mistakenly believe it depicts an American Indian because of its elaborate headdress. Actually, the statue's head is covered by a helmet circled with stars and topped with a crest composed of an eagle's head and decorative feathers. White disclosed the renovation project at a ceremony launching a multimillion-dollar fund-raising effort seeking private donations for restoration work at the Capitol and to create a fund to buy art works associated with its past. In another project, the parking lot which has covered the Capitol's East Plaza since the beginning of the automotive age will be closed and the space filled with decorative stone paving. Two marble fountains, carved during <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s beautification campaign in the late 1960s but never installed because of a lack of funds, will be placed in the center of the plaza The newly created <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> will coordinate the fund raising and restoration under the direction of Former Postmaster General <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> said the aim of the new organization will be similar to that of the foundations created to refurbish <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the president's guest house, and to acquire historic objects for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s reception rooms. The commission also will receive half the profits from the sale of special coins to be issued later in the year to commemorate the bicentennial of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> said the first fund-raising effort will be a bicentennial banquet on June 20, which is intended to raise at least $ 1.5 million.

<HEAD>Government Intensifies 1985-1986 Fiero Fires Probe</HEAD>

 Nearly 150,000 <ORGANIZATION> Pontiac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fieros </ORGANIZATION> may be in danger of catching fire from oil that escapes if owners fail to keep the crankcase filled, according to complaints that prompted an intensification of a federal safety probe. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it had upgraded a preliminary evaluation of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> cars to an engineering analysis. Investigations are typically raised to the higher level when engineers see reason to believe there might be a safety problem with vehicles. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 agreed to recall 126,000 1984-model Fieros after similar reports of fires, <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said. The 1985 and 1986 Fieros had the same oil-system design as did the 1984 models, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudgens </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. According to the complaints, driving the Fieros with low oil levels can cause a connecting rod to break. Oil escaping from the resulting hole `` would catch on fire when it contacted the exhaust manifold or hot exhaust components,'' the agency's engineers said in summarizing the alleged defect. The agency said it has received 148 complaints regarding the Fieros, including reports of six injuries. The engineering analysis affects 147,571 1985 and 1986 Fieros, <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Hudgens </PERSON> said failure of drivers to maintain their cars properly may be part of the problem. `` If you ran out of oil, and then that coupled with some aggressive driving perhaps and maybe not changing the oil very often, you end up with a broken rod, and that's where the connecting rod came in,'' <PERSON> Hudgens </PERSON> said. `` It is still the owner's responsibility to check the oil. The Fiero went out of production in 1988 in what was `` strictly a marketing decision,'' <PERSON> Hudgens </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> also opened a new preliminary evaluation into unconfirmed reports of power-steering loss in <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s 1987 A-body cars with 4-cylinder engines. The A-body cars are the <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Celebrity </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Oldsmobile </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciera </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> 6000. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said it had received nine complaints, including one accident with an injury, of fluid leaking from the power-steering pressure hose, which resulted in a sudden loss of steering assistance. That investigation involves 527,459 cars, <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said. Nine other preliminary evaluations were opened by the agency into: _ Erratic cruise control in about 10,000 1987 Chrysler Jeep Cherokees _ Windshield wiper failure in 300,000 1988-model GM <LOCATION> Corsica </LOCATION> and Beretta vehicles _ Erratic cruise control in 1988 <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suburban </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> vehicles with 5.7 liter or 7.4 liter engines _ Excessive windshield fogging in 115,000 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Excel </ORGANIZATION> GL vehicles _ Gasoline splashing from the filler pipe due to alleged faulty venting in 180,000 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cars </ORGANIZATION> _ Rear-brake jamming due to a faulty retaining ring in 900,000 1986-1987 <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LeSabre </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Oldsmobile </ORGANIZATION> 88 and <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bonneville </LOCATION> _ Jamming of the steering mechanism in 800,000 1985 and 1986 GM G-body cars The models using the now discontinued G-body were the <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carlo </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Camino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> Grand Prix and <LOCATION> Bonneville </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Oldsmobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cutlass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Brougham </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regal </ORGANIZATION>. _ Rear-axle seal failure in 576,000 1985 through 1988 <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astro </ORGANIZATION> and Safari vehicles <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> also raised two preliminary evaluations to the engineering analysis level. They involved jamming of the front-seat lap belt in 394,500 1987-1988 Toyota Camry vehicles, and windshield-wiper failure in 465,500 1986 through 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerostar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minivans </ORGANIZATION>. The agency closed three investigations, finding there was `` no defect trend.'' The investigations were into complaints of: _ Tail-light wiring fires in 1987-1988 Chrysler Omnis _ Air-brake emergency valve defects in the Navistar 1988 S-series school bus _ Engine surge in 1983-1986 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> cars with 3.8-liter and 5-liter fuel-injected engines

<HEAD>Democrats Say Bush Has to Give First On Minimum Wage</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Democrats leading the effort to raise the minimum wage say they are willing to make concessions but only if President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does the same. `` Nothing is concrete,'' Rep. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, D-Pa., said Tuesday `` Just about every provision in this is negotiable.'' But <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> and other lawmakers on a conference committee to resolve differences between <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> - and Senate-passed minimum wage bills said they will not offer any concessions unless <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> drops his repeated veto threats and first offers a compromise of his own The prospects for such a development appear slim. Knowing that, the Democrats intensified their efforts to portray <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as turning his back on the working poor, a pitch that itself is part of an effort by the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> to make political hay of any <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> veto of minimum wage legislation. `` We will send you this bill and we will send you another bill, and we will make you wish that you did n't have the power to veto,'' said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>. `` We're asking for some leadership, not the threat of a veto.'' Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., questioned the motives of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s refusal to negotiate by pointing to a number of recent agreements between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the White House on issues ranging from Contra aid to the savings and loan crisis `` Why not on the minimum wage?'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` To millions of low-income Americans the answer must seem obvious: the administration does n't care enough about them to listen to their position. Kinder and gentler does not mean you.'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> compared <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s stance on the minimum wage with his proposal to expand capital gains tax breaks that would be enjoyed predominantly by wealthy Americans. `` The president ought to have as much concern for the poor as he does for the rich,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. The conferees said they hope to have a final product in about two weeks and indicated it would be stripped of a number of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> amendments unrelated to the minimum wage, including one that would raise the outside earnings limit for Social Security recipients. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has repeatedly said the only minimum wage bill he will accept is his own, an offer to raise the minimum from its current level of $ 3.35 an hour to $ 4.25 by January 1992, provided employers can pay all new workers less than the minimum for up to six months. Both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> measures would raise the minimum wage to $ 4.55 by October 1991 and allow a `` sub-minimum'' to be paid to some newly hired workers for just two months. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said that if no compromise is reached, he is considering a number of other approaches to raising the minimum wage, including a simple one-year increase of the base wage instead of the incremental boosts contained in the current measures.

<HEAD>Philippine Vice President Says Marcos Should Be Allowed to Die at

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Philippine Vice President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON>, who met recently with <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> at his sickbed, says the exiled former president should be allowed to leave <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and return home to die. `` I think he should be allowed to return _ not only to die in his own country, but to face whatever charges will be filed against him. Let the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> people decide the case,'' <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said Tuesday in an interview. The vice president, who has broken politically with President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, was meeting this week with several members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> during a private visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He was scheduled to deliver an address today before the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, a private research group. Laurel's position is in direct opposition to Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s. The mere idea that the former dictator might return to the homeland he ruled for 20 years is an extremely sensitive national question. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has repeatedly rejected <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' requests, citing security concerns. But the vice president dismissed the idea that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' return to his homeland _ dead or alive _ would spark unrest. `` I do n't buy that. I think they are overrating <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think his return would cause that kind of destabilization.'' The vice president's trip to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' bedside in February was the subject of some speculation in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> that he was looking for support from <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters as he began to work with an opposition party in advance of the 1992 elections. As a former opponent of the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> regime, <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said he was surprised to receive the invitation from <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to go to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. He said he returned to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> with a message for Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> from the dying former president, but Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> refused to see him. <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said his interest was `` national reconciliation.'' He said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' message, which he would not reveal, did not involve a `` deal'' but `` was something that might straighten out things.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has been hospitalized in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> since Jan. 16, suffering from bronchial asthma and pneumonia. In December, he was hospitalized twice with congestive heart failure. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was ousted in 1986 in a popular uprising that later swept Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and her running mate, Laurel, into office. In September 1987, <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> resigned as foreign secretary, citing widespread differences with Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> on the 20-year battle against a communist insurgency and other issues such as the country's economic development. The Marcoses are under indictment in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on racketeering charges. The couple would need permission from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney general and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to leave the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The indictment accuses the ousted <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> dictator and his wife of stealing more than $ 100 million from the Philippine treasury to buy real estate and expensive art objects in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Overall, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> says the couple took $ 3.5 billion in cash and property. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has pleaded innocent to the charges contained in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has said he is too ill to appear in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for legal proceedings. <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> argued that as a man who is charged with looting the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> should face charges there first. `` The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> has a prior claim over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. ... It may be that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has a valid case against him ... but offenses committed against the Filipino people should be decided by the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> courts,'' <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said.

 In a cost-cutting move, the Soviets are bringing their cosmonauts home from their space station Mir next week and leaving it unmanned until August, the station's deputy flight director says. <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blagov </PERSON> said no technical problems had cropped up in the 3-year-old orbiting complex that is the showcase of the Soviet space program. His comments Tuesday came a day after the magazine <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Week </ORGANIZATION> and Space Technology reported in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that Mir had developed a serious electrical power problem. Mir's solar batteries, <PERSON> Blagov </PERSON> said, were experiencing some power loss but that it was within expected levels and was not causing any problem. <PERSON> Blagov </PERSON> said plans to keep Soviets aboard the station continuously were abandoned for several reasons. `` By this action, we are of course economizing some sum which can be used for other purposes,'' he said by telephone from the <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kaliningrad </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. He did not identify the other purposes, but the public has called for the untold millions of rubles spent on space to be diverted toward ending chronic shortages of consumer goods and food. <PERSON> Blagov </PERSON> said Soviet scientists were swamped analyzing information gathered from Mir, which was launched Feb. 20, 1986. They now must pause to review `` what we have accomplished and decide what's next. Tentative plans call for a module the same size as Mir to be attached to the station at year's end, and until then there is no need for a crew, <PERSON> Blagov </PERSON> said. A launching of a replacement crew originally scheduled for today has been canceled. Cosmonauts <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Volkov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Krikalev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Polyakov </PERSON> are to mothball the Mir and return to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> on April 27. A new crew will be sent up in mid-August to prepare for the attaching the new module, <PERSON> Blagov </PERSON> said. The attachment contains a space bicycle for cosmonauts, a solar battery to supplement that of the Mir, an East German optical experiment and an airlock through which cosmonauts can pass to take spacewalks. One module, a space laboratory, was attached to Mir in April 1987 and three others are planned, including one to be put up at the end of this year or early next year in which crystals will be grown for semiconductors, electronic parts used in computers and other devices, <PERSON> Blagov </PERSON> said. One reason for putting Mir on automatic mode is to give a rest to its support staff at mission control and tracking stations that have been working continuously for three years, <PERSON> Blagov </PERSON> said. `` People are tired. They have n't had vacations. We owe them this,'' he said. Officials have said a ground controller sent an erroneous command to an unmanned Mars probe, Phobos I, in September, leaving it useless. A sister ship, <PERSON> Phobos </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, was lost for still undetermined reasons last month. <PERSON> Blagov </PERSON> said Mir uses different controllers than those who worked on Phobos, but indicated all are susceptible to fatigue. `` Tiredness can lead to an increase in mistakes, and a break gives a positive effect to a person's work,'' <PERSON> Blagov </PERSON> said. During the three-month break, he said, scientists will continue to gather data from automatic Mir instruments studying a supernova, photographing the ocean shelf and monitoring meteorites. Engineers are boosting the Mir to a higher orbit to keep its orbit from decaying, <PERSON> Blagov </PERSON> said. In 1974, the vacant <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Skylab </ORGANIZATION> 4 space station fell into the Earth's atmosphere and disintegrated upon re-entry.

 Environmentalists are gearing up for an international `` Earth Day 1990'' that they hope will dwarf the original of 20 years ago, an event that helped make <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> laws more sensitive to environmental concerns. `` The purpose of Earth Day in 1970 was to organize a nationwide grassroots demonstration of public concern for the environment,'' former Sen. <PERSON> Gaylord </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, who founded the event, said Tuesday. `` Though much has been achieved in many areas in the past 20 years, we continue to lose ground in the fight to improve our environment.'' <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, coordinator of the first Earth Day, and Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass. and Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N </LOCATION>. Y, who were local Earth Day activists 20 years ago, joined <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> at a news conference to announce plans for the April 22, 1990, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, who now is counselor to the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, called on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to lead other heads of state into a `` battle to save the Earth.'' <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said the observance is meant to start a decade of environmental concern showing that countries throughout the world have a `` shared set of values and commitment to save the planet.'' He said that organizers have talked to members of the White House staff, but have not yet approached <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> directly. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said no president campaigns against environmental policies, but none since <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> has understood what needs to be done. Leaders of other nations have been similarly shortsighted, he said. `` In the leading industrial nations Prime Minister <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Mitterand </PERSON> have joined President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in paying lip service to global environmental problems,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. `` None has yet said anything important about their plans for resolving these problems or made any serious proposals for addressing them.'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has adopted laws to begin cleanup, but is n't keeping up with the problems. `` Of 1,200 major hazardous waste sites, just 34 have been cleaned up,'' he said. `` And while <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 allocated $ 1.6 billion to help clean up such sites, estimates of the federal share now range up to $ 300 billion.''

<TEXT>
 An official ceremony honored the more than 4,300 Polish officers killed in the World War II <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> massacre and a new inscription did n't blame either the Nazis or the Soviets for the atrocity. Instead, the tablet that was unveiled Tuesday at <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s Powazki Cemetery said only: `` To Polish officers killed in <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION>. The previous inscription blamed `` Hitlerite fascists.'' Polish generals speaking at the ceremony indicated the issue of determining guilt for the massacre _ a highly emotional issue in <LOCATION> Polish-Soviet </LOCATION> relations _ has not yet been resolved to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s satisfaction After the ceremony ended, some people among the several thousand spectators placed a sign on the granite memorial reading: `` Soviet murder.'' Up until this year, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Communist governments officially accepted Soviet claims that the Polish officers shot at <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION>, near the Soviet city of <LOCATION> Smolensk </LOCATION>, and buried in mass graves were killed by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> after <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> in 1941. Western historians have concluded that the massacre was committed by Soviet secret police on <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s order in 1940. The officers, the cream of Polish society called up from the reserves, were among about 15,000 interned by the Soviets when they occupied eastern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in 1939. The fate of the other 11,000 is not known. Polish members of a joint Polish-Soviet commission investigating the massacre say they have tentatively concluded that the Soviets were to blame, but the Soviets have not acknowledged that account. Speakers at the ceremony did not speak of Soviet culpability but made it clear the issue remains open. `` This event indicates a victory of new thinking in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' said Gen. <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Paszkowski </PERSON>, who led the official delegation. `` Although you know your husbands and sons are not alive, please remember they will stay forever in our hearts and minds.'' Gen. <PERSON> Franciszek </PERSON> <PERSON> Skibinski </PERSON> said: `` It is not possible to change the course of history, but it is necessary to reveal the whole truth. I hope the Polish-Soviet commission will soon complete its work and the whole truth will be made public.'' During the ceremony an urn of soil from the graves of the massacred officers was embedded in the monument. An official delegation that included relatives of the victims had gone to <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> and brought back two urns. On Tuesday, one urn was brought to the cemetery and the other placed at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Soldiers lined the cemetery walkways and an honor guard of boy scouts stood at the flower-covered memorial. A woman whose husband and brother-in-law were killed at <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> said she expected `` the whole truth will come out now.''

<HEAD>Court Asked to Rule on High Liability Awards</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The nation's second-largest waste hauler is asking the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to reverse a $ 6 million jury verdict against it as an example of `` bloated, irrational and excessive awards'' in liability lawsuits. In a case that businesses say could have an enormous impact on their insurance costs and the overall competitiveness of American industry, <ORGANIZATION> Browning-Ferris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> argued Tuesday against what it called huge punitive damage awards. <ORGANIZATION> BFI </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frey </PERSON> told the high court that enormous punitive damage awards violate the Constitution's Eighth Amendment prohibition against excessive fines, as well as due process rights and common law. The case centers on a lawsuit brought by <ORGANIZATION> Kelco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disposal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, againt Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> BFI </ORGANIZATION>, accusing the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> company of predatory pricing to drive <ORGANIZATION> Kelco </ORGANIZATION> out of business. A <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> jury awarded <ORGANIZATION> Kelco </ORGANIZATION> $ 51,146 in compensatory damages, in contrast to the much larger punitive total. <ORGANIZATION> Kelco </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartow </PERSON> <PERSON> Farr </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> argued the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against excessive fines does not apply to punitive damages `` awarded in a private state court tort action,'' and applying it would be `` intrusive second-guessing'' of jury verdicts <PERSON> Farr </PERSON> said state laws provide for punitive-damage awards to be reviewed by the courts, and such awards are `` routinely reduced.'' `` The courts below upheld this award under traditional common law standards,'' <PERSON> Farr </PERSON> said. `` Damages are simply not fines.'' Dozens of `` friend-of-the-court'' briefs were filed as manufacturers, publishers, insurers, broadcasters, pharmacists, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, defense attorneys and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> officials all urged the justices to place some limits on punitive damages. They say unfettered jury decisions allowing huge penalty awards are driving up insurance rates and discouraging the marketing of products from medical equipment to football helmets. Trial attorneys and consumer groups, who argue punitive damages are the best protection against bad business practices, have sided with <ORGANIZATION> Kelco </ORGANIZATION>, which survived <ORGANIZATION> BFI </ORGANIZATION>'s price cutting and in 1985 forced the larger company out of town. Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> questioned whether ruling for <ORGANIZATION> BFI </ORGANIZATION> would force the court to review all future punitive-damage awards that someone considered excessive. <PERSON> Frey </PERSON> said that applying the excessive-fines provision in such civil cases would sharply curb a growing trend toward excessive awards that has prompted `` tort reform'' by state legislatures. Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> insisted <PERSON> Frey </PERSON> was seeking a national standard that all 50 states would have to follow, rather than allowing each state to set its own punitive-damage limits. The court is expected to announce its decision by July. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Browning-Ferris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Kelco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disposal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 88-556.

 A 1990 budget plan reflecting the deal reached between the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is working its way through the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, but a separate $ 4.7 billion spending bill for this year is ruffling Republican feathers. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> began debating the fiscal 1990 budget resolution on Tuesday and hoped to finish its work today. On Tuesday, it voted 19-4 to reject an amendment by Sen. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, D-La., to institute deep across-the-board spending cuts in place of the compromise reached last week <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, complaining that the bipartisan pact `` does not cut the budget at all,'' said his plan would sent a message `` to start all over again, to do a real job of budgeting.'' Joining <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> was Sen. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, D-Neb., who said, `` If anyone thinks <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Baby </PERSON> was ugly, I suggest taking a close look at this newly hatched baby. Administration officials and congressional leaders ended a month of negotiations last Friday by announcing a deal for $ 1.2 trillion budget that claims a deficit of $ 99.4 billion. The budget committee is charged with producing a congressional resolution that will guide later spending and tax bills for fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1. Chairman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn., said he would oppose any plan that did not follow the White House pact But trouble was brewing across <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> on a so-called dire emergency spending bill for this year. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved a $ 4.7 billion supplemental spending bill for fiscal 1989, a measure that if approved could put <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on a collision course with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. On a unanimous voice vote, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> appropriations panel sent the wide-ranging spending bill to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor. But first, in a party-line 28-18 vote, the committee's majority Democrats rejected a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> effort that would have shaved about $ 1.5 billion in new spending from the measure. `` The worst thing we could do here is report a bill perceived to be fiscally irresponsible and a budget buster,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Conte </PERSON>, R-Mass., ranking Republican on the appropriations panel The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration renewed its threat to veto the so-called `` dire emergency'' bill, stating in a letter that the president favored the less expensive <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> alternative. `` In my view, fiscal responsibility requires that we go no further,'' administration budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> wrote to <PERSON> Conte </PERSON>. Last month, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to approve a $ 2.2 billion version of the measure. The committee more than doubled its size. As passed by the committee, the bill provides $ 1.2 billion for veterans programs, $ 892 million for the Guaranteed Student Loan program for college students, $ 822 million for drug efforts, $ 600 million to fight last summer's forest fires, $ 423 million for foster care and adoption programs, and $ 100 million to pay for the costs of immigration increases from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The measure also contains $ 127 million for workers whose jobs are lost due to foreign competition; $ 71 million for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to hire more air traffic controllers, inspectors and security officers; and $ 35 million to prosecute fraud cases involving the financially reeling savings and loan industry. Amendments Tuesday added $ 153 million for programs for the homeless; $ 88 million to help subsidize public housing projects; and $ 200,000 to provide aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for upcoming elections. One provision would prohibit the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> from spending money to make the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> home of mobster <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON> a historic site. With the 1989 deficit already projected at more than $ 163 billion, the spending measure would push the government's shortfall $ 1.3 billion deeper, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Management and Budget said. Under the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law, this year's deficit was not supposed to exceed $ 146 billion. Because the deficit figures reflect overall outlays, the bill's impact on the deficit is different from the spending authorized in the bill

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed into law a bipartisan plan to give the Contras non-military aid, even as <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials looked into human rights allegations that could block the $ 49.8 million package. The administration was trying to determine the veracity of a report Tuesday in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that the Nicaraguan rebels failed to expel a commander who was convicted of covering up a murder. The story said the rebels ignored a warning by a top <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official that they were required to take such action in order to remain eligible for the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. The new aid, the product of a March 24 bipartisan agreement between the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, calls for cutoff of the money if there are human rights abuses by the Contras. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the Contras' own military tribunal on March 23 expelled six Contra members for human rights violations, including the rebels' head of intelligence, known as <PERSON> Commandante </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>. But The Post, citing rebel sources, reported that <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> was still working at Contra headquarters despite his conviction and expulsion. `` His attendance at any official resistance function would be forbidden under the expulsion order,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official said that <PERSON> Commandante </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> and a regional commander known as <ORGANIZATION> Commandante </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nolan </ORGANIZATION> both had appealed their convictions to the Contra directorate. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Arcos </PERSON> confirmed Tuesday that he had made clear to the rebels during a meeting within the last three weeks that they were expected to remove the violaters from their ranks. `` Legally we would have the basis,'' to halt the aid if they did not, <PERSON> Arcos </PERSON> said. He said the admininistration was trying to find out if the newspaper report were true. He said the Contra military tribunal last month had convicted a commander with the nom de guerre <PERSON> Commandante </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, but that the leader was seen in the Contra camps subsequent to the time he should have been expelled. <PERSON> Arcos </PERSON> said that he was `` reassured'' then by the Contra leadership that they did intend to expel anyone convicted of human rights abuses, and now he was trying to find out if that had occurred with <PERSON> Commandante </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed the legislation on Tuesday that will provide $ 49.8 million in non-military aid to sustain the rebels until <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> holds elections early next year. The legislation was hammered out after two months of negotiation between administration officials and congressional leaders. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> restated his backing for a diplomatic solution in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> after years of a pro-military policy advanced by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also repeated his call for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to help bring peace to the region by ending its military aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> must match its rhetorical support for the peace process with concrete action to halt military aid, to end subversion in that region and to promote genuine democracy in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Monday. In brief remarks in a Rose Garden signing ceremony, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was flanked by Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. He said that prospects for peace `` depend on full and honest Sandinista compliance with their repeated pledges of democracy and freedom.'' `` It's clear that close international scrutiny and sustained pressure will be critical to induce Sandinista compliance,'' he said. The package calls for non-lethal aid to the rebels until the Nicaraguan elections scheduled for next February. The money, administered through the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, also can be used to repatriate the Contras. The package also includes $ 4.2 million, to be administered by the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, in medical assistance for civilian victims of the civil war. The Contras, whose numbers are estimated at 11,000, are encamped along the Honduran border.

<HEAD>Smithsonian TV Exhibit Draws Original `Lassie' Star</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Provost </PERSON>, child star of the `` Lassie'' television show of three decades ago, will soon start filming a new version of the long-popular TV series for broadcast next fall, playing an uncle of the dog's young masters. Now 39 and a real estate agent in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rosa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, Provost was a surprise visitor at the preview Tuesday of a new exhibition celebrating 50 years of American television. The yearlong show opens today at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION>. Touring the exhibit of 200 artifacts and more than 100 photographs tracing the history of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television, Provost paused for a nostalgic look at the costume he wore as <PERSON> Timmy </PERSON> in the original `` Lassie'' series. Provost had made a gift to the Smithsonian of the red-checkered sports shirt, blue jeans and black-topped tennis shoes he wore on the show from 1957 until 1964. The actor was 7 years old when he began filming the series, and quit the show when he was 14. `` It really was a thrill to be asked to donate them to the Smithsonian,'' he said. Provost said he will play an uncle on the new syndicated `` Lassie'' show, which will star <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> and her real-life husband, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, as the parents. The new TV family's pet collie will be the eighth generation descendant of the original Lassie, he said. Last week, during preliminary filming in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> with the full cast, <PERSON> Provost </PERSON> said `` it really brought back memories'' to make friends with the new Lassie. `` We definitely will be building a relationship, I think,'' he said. The museum exhibit, underwritten by the consumer electronics group of the <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, traces the history of American television from its inauguration at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>'s Fair in April 1939. President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s speech at the opening ceremonies was broadcast to about 200 TV receivers in metropolitan <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, marking the start of regular television service in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Highlights of the show include the <ORGANIZATION> RCA </ORGANIZATION> television receiver, encased in Lucite, which was displayed at the World's Fair and other early TV sets. Memorabilia on display include <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON>'s wing chair from `` All In The Family,'' the pith helmet worn by <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, host of the `` Wild Kingdom'' show, <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON>'s cowboy hat from `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>,'' the <LOCATION> Howdy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Doody </LOCATION> marionette, the leather jacket that <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> wore as the Fonz on `` Happy Days'' and a stainless steel coffee pot used on the soap opera, `` The Guiding Light.'' At the preview Tuesday, museum director <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said the exhibition seeks to illustrate the dramatic growth of television's influence on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> society since World War II. `` Aside from instruments of mass destruction,'' he said, `` television is probably the most significant lever of change in the American psyche in the past two generations.''

<HEAD>Coalition Fights to Keep Syndication Rules Intact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A coalition of television producers, unions and station owners says it will fight any attempt by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> to re-enter and dominate the lucrative syndicated TV market the networks were forced to leave in 1983. The <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday announced that a 207-member coalition would stand in the way of the networks if they attempt to `` gut'' the so-called financial interest and syndication rule. <ORGANIZATION> MPAA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON> said the coalition was putting the networks on notice that `` we will not lag or hesitate to defend the rule and hold it in place.'' A 1983 consent decree between the networks and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> forced the networks out of the syndication business. That agreement expires in 1990, and the networks and producers have been negotiating to try to reach a new accord without further government intervention. But the talks have reached an impasse, the Coalition to Preserve the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules said. Independent producers say they owe their very existences to the 1983 decree, under which the networks were allowed to keep the programs they broadcast for four years and then return them to producers for sale to independent TV stations and network affiliates. Hit programs such as `` The Cosby Show'' and `` Miami Vice'' can make many millions of dollars in this syndication market. Unlike before, the networks were barred from holding any financial interest in programs they license from outside producers. But the networks take all advertising revenues from a program's network run The program producers, on the other hand, are paid a licensing fee by the networks _ typically $ 1 million to $ 1.5 million for an hourlong program _ that usually does n't meet the total costs of the production. But the producers can profit enormously in syndication with a hit show. `` The rule is working,'' the coalition said. `` The number of independent TV stations has grown; so has the number and quality of producers creating programming for network and syndicated exhibition. ... Meanwhile, the three major networks remain profitable and dominant.'' An <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutledge </PERSON>, said the rules, which first were adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in 1970, have `` had exactly the opposite effect from what was intended.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 recommended the rules be repealed because the rules `` had concentrated power in the hands of a small number of studios rather than adding to diversity.'' <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Kriegel </PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said he hoped the addition of independent producers to the studio-network negotiations `` will be good for the talks.'' He said the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> studios, who are in the present coalition, were trying to consolidate their gains against the networks in numerous areas. `` Half the <ORGANIZATION> MPAA </ORGANIZATION> members are in direct competition with the networks,'' <PERSON> Kriegel </PERSON> said. `` Every leader in that community is now going into our business very aggressively.'' The coalition includes the <ORGANIZATION> MPAA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stations </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Directors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theatrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Screen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Actors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> and the Consumer Federation of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was presented a wide range of options for modernizing <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s nuclear arsenal and pursuing Star Wars research, but made no immediate decisions, according to <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> chief, who arrived here this morning for his first <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> meeting since assuming office, told reporters he did n't expect to learn of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decisions on those two critical issues until the end of the week. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said some of his own decisions about where to cut the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s fiscal 1990 budget would depend on what the president decided. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is grappling with whether he can afford the type of financial commitment to Star Wars made by former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and with whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should build a small mobile nuclear missile or place the giant MX missile on rail car launchers. Congressional and administration leaders agree the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> needs a mobile missile to better deter a Soviet attack, but not on which missile is best. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, appearing relaxed on his <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jet as he embarked on what he called his `` maiden voyage'' to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, refused Tuesday to discuss his own recommendations to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today that <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> he favors building a railroad-based version of the MX nuclear missile and scrapping the planned Midgetman missile. Both weapons are designed as successors to the Minuteman, which has formed the heart of the nation's land-based atomic missile force for two decades. The Pentagon has built 50 MX weapons for deployment in silos in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. If <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> favors the rail-based MX over the Midgetman, he would be taking the position long favored by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. The Midgetman has chiefly been supported by Democrats, who control <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. But the defense secretary acknowledged there were still sharp divisions within the administration on how best to proceed and that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had received `` a wide range of opinions'' during a closed-door <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting at the White House Tuesday. `` Obviously, there are strongly held views within the administration on these questions,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said. `` And there are different views within the administration on these questions.'' While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is still debating nuclee <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s original 1990 budget proposal by $ 10 billion. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and congressional Democrats agreed last week on that cut, which will force the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to settle for a budget that fails to match the inflation rate. The new total for military spending is $ 305.5 billion. While <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> declined to discuss any of his specific budget decisions, an aide who demanded anonymity said the defense chief planned to kill the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>' V-22 Osprey aircraft program and force the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to accept a cut in its aircraft carrier fleet. The V-22 is a high-tech `` hybrid'' aircraft that can take off like a helicopter and fly like an airplane, thanks to engines that swivel at the ends of its wings. At a cost of more than $ 20 million per plane, however, `` <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> has a hard time accepting this as a cost-effective way to carry 20 Marines into combat,'' the aide said. As for the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> meeting, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said it was important that the alliance proceed with modernizing its Lance short-range nuclear missiles, now that all intermediate-range missiles had been abolished by treaty with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But the <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary added he expected no final decisions at this week's meeting on the timetable for replacing the Lance. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has expressed reservations about the issue, dividing the alliance by suggesting further arms-control talks with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> might obviate the need for modernizing the Lance. The issue is particularly sensitive in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, since most short-range nuclear missiles are deployed there and would be used there in the event of war.

<HEAD>Lawmaker Pushes For Fat and Cholesterol Labeling To Fight Heart Disease</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Moakley </PERSON>, D-Mass., has proposed requiring that food products include easily understood details of fat and cholesterol content to help consumers reduce their chances of heart disease `` You could starve to death in the supermarket just reading the labels,'' complained the 61-year-old lawmaker. Under the measure, the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> would require food manufacturers to list the different types of fat _ saturated, polyunsaturated and monounsaturated _ and their amounts. Federal regulations now require food producers to list only the total fat content. The ninth-term <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> said the current labeling provision `` is particularly disturbing since some fats increase blood cholesterol and other types of fat actually lower one's cholesterol. The bill also would require food manufacturers to specify amounts of dietary cholesterol, which also has been linked to heart disease. There currently is no cholesterol labeling requirement.

 A group of House Republicans are hoping to repeal parts of the new catastrophic health expansion of Medicare _ mainly the income tax surcharge imposed on the well-to-do elderly to help finance the program. The proposal, unveiled at a news conference Tuesday, would keep most major benefits of the program, but revamp a prescription drug benefit and make its more generous provisions apply only to low-income Medicare beneficiaries not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid. The law passed by overwhelming margins in both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last year _ despite vocal opposition from opponents of the surcharge _ and was signed into law by then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> with great fanfare. The surcharge has provoked a barrage of letters to lawmakers even though it does not apply to 60 percent of all 32 million Medicare beneficiaries who do not have enough income to pay federal taxes. Of the 40 percent subject to the surcharge, only those couples with annual incomes of $ 100,000 or so would be subject to the maximum surcharge of $ 800 a person. Rep. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilirakis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., a lead sponsor of the legislation, acknowledged that many of his own constituents who have complained mistakenly believe they will be subject to an income tax surcharge

<HEAD>Post-Strike Violence Leaves Two Dead, 138 Arrested, Blackouts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A general strike against the military government turned violent as police battled demonstrators in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> and other cities and about 50 bomb attacks blacked out much of the capital. Police said they killed two `` extremists'' and arrested more than 130 demonstrators on Tuesday before calm was restored at midnight. Large areas of the capital and other cities had been left without power for several hours. Demonstrators fought police in downtown <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> during daylight Tuesday and then at night in the slums that ring the city. The strike, called by the nation's largest union to protest the incarceration of two labor leaders, failed to generate support from workers but there were clashes between helmeted riot police and demonstrators in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> and other cities. Police said six officers and a security agent were injured in clashes but they did not report injuries among protesters. Hospitals reported receiving `` numerous'' injuries. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said 138 protesters were arrested nationwide and that police resorted to using tear gas and water cannon to scatter the mostly young demonstrators. At night, demonstrators blocked traffic at intersections in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>'s slums, erecting fire barricades. Local radio stations said unidentified gunmen in speeding cars were seen shooting at demonstrators manning the barricades. In the most serious incident, police said two `` extremists'' were killed in a clash with security forces when they were caught planting a bomb near an electrical tower in northern <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>. The strike was called by the opposition <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s largest labor federation with 300,000 members. The union said the strike was to press for the release of its president, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustos </PERSON>, and its vice president, <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. Both leaders have been banished in small provincial towns since September after a court sentenced them to 541 days' internal exile for calling another general strike in 1987. Tuesday's strike, however, seemed to have little effect as most factories and businesses operated near normalcy, although school attendance was notably lower than normal. The government pronounced the strike `` a total failure.'' Labor Minister <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> said, `` There has been no strike in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> today.'' He said around 95 percent of the nation's 4.5 million workers were on the job in spite of a cutback in the public transportation system. Several of the bomb blasts destroyed or damaged power towers, blacking out large areas of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> and several other cities for several hours until power could be restored.

<HEAD>Researchers in Italy Report New Approach To Cold Fusion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scientists <PERSON> Umberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Colombo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Scaramuzzi </PERSON> say they achieved nuclear fusion at room temperature using a different technique than the recent cold fusion experiments which prompted their tests. <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alternative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> at Frascati, just outside <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Scaramuzzi </PERSON>, who performed the experiments at the agency, both emphasized that it was too early to say if their process would prove practical for generating energy. Their experiments produced large emissions of neutrons but too little energy to register, the two men reported. A neutron is an uncharged elementary particle of an atom. Emissions of neutrons are evidence of fusion. Fusion produces energy when the cores of two hydrogen atoms fuse. It is the process that powers the sun. Fission is atom-splitting, the method employed by conventional nuclear power plants. The Italians began their experiments after <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON>, a chemistry professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION>, and his British colleague, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southampton </ORGANIZATION>, announced to the world on March 23 that they achieved nuclear fusion at room temperature using common laboratory equipment. Researchers have long sought a way to harness nuclear fusion. Standard experiments have used extremely high temperatures. <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> said their experiment ran for more than 100 hours and produced four times as much energy as it used. Their experiments used electrolysis, in which an electrical current was used to herd hydrogen atoms into metal electrodes, where the atoms were apparently forced to fuse because of proximity. Researcher <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> says he found evidence of only very low energy output in a similar experiment. <PERSON> Scaramuzzi </PERSON> told reporters on Tuesday, `` After <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' experiment, I asked myself, how important is electrolysis? There must be more than one road to fusion.'' The Italian experiments did not use electrical current to trigger the reaction, nor did they use `` heavy water,'' which contains a heavy version of hydrogen called deuterium. <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> reported, `` The experiment is totally different from former ones. We have paved the way for a new road to fusion research. What we do n't know yet is if the energy generated is sufficient to justify practical application.'' <PERSON> Scaramuzzi </PERSON>, 60, said, `` If this experiment were not of such great importance to the public, we would never have announced the discovery at this point. We are still in a very preliminary phase.'' He said that on two occasions they measured high emissions of neutrons after placing a sample of the element titanium and deuterium gas in a special metal tube and subjecting it to various pressures and temperatures. The neutrons appeared in one case after applying high pressure and low temperature, and in another at low pressure and room temperature. <PERSON> Scaramuzzi </PERSON> said the energy output of his experiment at this scale was too low to be registered. <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> meanwhile said Monday that further experiments yielded even more energy than the earlier Pons-Fleischmann efforts and ran more efficiently. He said a controlled fusion reaction was sustained for more than 800 hours in a small flask containing heavy water and a palladium electrode and that recent tests produced roughly eight times the energy consumed. <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> said researchers measured the production of 20 to 30 watts of electricity from the experiment, or about 67 watts per cubic centimeter of electrode, compared to 26 watts per cubic centimeter in the earlier experiments. He reported that more than 60 university and private laboratories partly verified the claims he made last month with <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON>. The official Czechoslovak news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that a team of Czechoslovak physicists led by <PERSON> Pavol </PERSON> <PERSON> Povinc </PERSON> also produced room-temperature fusion through the electrolysis method. The team, from the <ORGANIZATION> Comenius </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s faculty of mathematics in <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Slovakia </LOCATION>, said they achieved fusion on Monday.

 Descriptions of dismemberment and a skull being split open were read in court from statements of accused members of an occult group of drug smugglers that authorities said killed 15 people. Separately, the `` godfather'' of the group and his girlfriend were among 11 people indicted Tuesday by a grand jury in <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> and the others were charged with conspiracy to import marijuana, importing marijuana, conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and possession with intent to distribute, authorities said. <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> and four others remained at large. With Judge <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Salador </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Fourth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> presiding late Tuesday, court officials here read aloud from the statements given by the five men arrested in connection with the killings. The victims included <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> student abducted during a spring-break outing to <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> in March. The five stood together, handcuffed and silent during the preliminary hearing. They smoked occasionally as they listened to the description of the horrors that occurred during ceremonies in a wooden shack on a ranch near where most of the killings took place. The accused said those ceremonies were part of a ritualistic cult. Four of the men refused to corroborate or deny the written statements, arguing that their attorney was not present. They declined a court-appointed counsel's help. Defendant <PERSON> Elio </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> told reporters near him that the statement read to him `` did not agree entirely with what I declared.'' The judge said that the accused can submit additional statements or have their own attorneys later. He now has three days to consider the evidence and decide whether to continue to hold them without bail. The accused have identified <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> as the group's leader who offered them `` luck and protection'' in exchange for the human sacrifices. Besides <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, those under arrest are his brother, <PERSON> Serafin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>; <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>; <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Serna </PERSON>; and ranch caretaker <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> was the only person who ratified his original statement that led police to the ranch and the discovery of the bodies. `` The godfather asked us for a gringo for a sacrifice,'' read the statement by <PERSON> Serafin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>. `` He said the brains had to be placed in a pot.'' <PERSON> Serafin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> described how they picked up <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> by offering him a ride. The student later tried to escape, but was caught and taken to the ranch blindfolded. Also described was how <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> was killed with a machete blow to the back of the head: `` We called the godfather at the hotel and told him what he wanted was ready. He came in the next day ... the godfather and <PERSON> Elio </PERSON> and others were inside -LRB- the shack -RRB-. We heard a noise like a coconut being cut open and ... they took out his brains ... and part of the spine, and they cut his legs.'' <PERSON> Serna </PERSON>'s statement described how the group once raided another ranch, stealing nearly 660 pounds of marijuana and abducting three people. They were brought back to the ranch tied and blindfolded. `` We dug a hole and the godfather threw them in still alive and machine-gunned them.'' <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Benitez </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayala </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> in this border city, said four of the 15 men found buried were randomly chosen human sacrifices. The rest probably were drug traffickers the organization found necessary to eliminate, he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> captured its fourth straight ratings victory but the broadcast networks' audience continued to dwindle. The networks blamed the scriptwriters' strike, cable and independent TV stations, and negative reviews. The three networks' combined share of the prime-time TV audience was 68 percent _ the lowest in television history and about 3 percent below last season, according to the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Last year's five-month <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> strike delayed the usual September start of almost every series, forcing <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and CBS to produce `` writerproof'' programs such as news specials and new productions of old scripts from series like `` Mission: Impossible. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> escaped the brunt of the strike because it broadcast the 1988 Summer Olympics and the World Series, popular sports specials unaffected by the labor dispute. It won all 30 weeks of the September-to-April season, the first time any network has done so since 1963-64, and claimed three of the four most popular series, <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> said Tuesday. The network's margin of victory _ 24 percent _ was the second-largest in <LOCATION> Nielsen </LOCATION> ratings history, the network said. For the 1956-1957 season, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> had a 25.6 rating, 27 percent ahead of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, which had a 20.1 rating. `` It's something we're all very proud of,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive officer. `` What the writers' strike did is hurt the new product,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Poltrack </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' senior vice president of planning and research. `` The strike had an impact. It was not an even impact. It helps the established competition.'' The strike also boosted the performance of the <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Poltrack </PERSON> said. `` It was during the strike period that ` Married With Children' and ` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted' started to produce big numbers,'' he said. Boosted by its situation comedy `` Roseanne,'' the season's highest-rated new series, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> finished in second place <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> came in last among the Big Three for the second consecutive year. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and CBS disputed <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s calculations, saying the television season really began Oct. 24. Although both networks reported the same order of finish, their numbers depicted <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s victory in less overwhelming terms. Based on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s figures, the network had a yearly rating of 16.0, followed by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> with 12.9 and CBS with 12.6, or a combined 41.5. Last year, the combined rating was 42.8. Since each rating point equals the 904,000 households with televisions, the networks' loss was an estimated 1.175 million homes. Led by No. 1 hit `` The Cosby Show'' and the situation comedies `` A Different World,'' `` Cheers,'' `` The Golden Girls'' and `` ALF,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had 13 of the top 20 programs last season. The ratings for the week ending April 16 _ the end of the TV season _ had <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> as the winner with a 14.5 rating, followed by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> with 12.7 and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> with 12.1. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> has won 43 ratings weeks in a row and is just four weeks from <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' all-time consecutive win record. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> last lost a week in the ratings in June 1988. `` What we have now is one No. 1 and two No. 3s,'' said <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, senior vice president for <PERSON> Bozell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Kenyon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Eckhardt </PERSON> advertising agency. `` It's never good for the industry to have one network so dominant,'' he said. `` It limits your programming choice and your media choice. You ca n't put everything on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>.'' But <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, once the media's darling, came under attack from many television critics who believed the network had turned to the tawdry. Among the targets: the racy miniseries `` Favorite Son,'' the lurid movie `` Full Exposure'' and <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>'s sensational documentary on devil worship. The season's most-watched miniseries was CBS' `` Lonesome Dove,'' the adaptation of novelist <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> McMurtry </PERSON>'s account of a cattle drive. In second was <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Women of <LOCATION> Brewster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Place </LOCATION>,'' starring <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Brotherhood of the Rose.'' `` War and Remembrance,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 100 million epic miniseries, finished in fourth. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wurtzel </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s senior vice president of marketing and research services, said his network was encouraged by its strong showing on Friday and Tuesday nights, the latter anchored by `` Roseanne.'' Still, he said the networks' overall losses likely will continue. `` I expect we'll see a fairly similar decline next year,'' he said. `` The loss will be consistent until the mid -'90s when cable penetration levels off

 House Democrats, looking warily toward the task of judging Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s ethics, have heard his defense and now turn their ears to their constituents. `` When this hits the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- floor, it's not going to be about justice,'' lamented Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, D-Calif. `` It's going to be about how it will play in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>. Members began spreading across the nation to their home districts after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> adjourned Tuesday for a long Passover holiday weekend. Before they left, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> worked hard to fortify Democrats for the inevitable onslaught of questions they will face during the town meetings, picnics and barbecues of hometown politics. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> is considering repaying $ 145,000 he is accused of receiving through improper gifts. The paper quoted an unidentified <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leader as saying the suggestion had been made to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and that the speaker apparently was considering it. The paper said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s office declined comment on whether he would repay any money <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, knowing he had to talk to his members before they hit the road, had committee chairmen cancel any meetings that conflicted with a special caucus of all House Democrats. He spoke for 40 minutes in the closed session, disputing the ethics committee charges that he violated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules in 69 instances involving his unusual book publishing deal and his benefits from a business partnership. `` I told them I intend to fight and I intend to win,'' he said. Supporters were charged up. `` There's a lot of outrage about how this whole process has become a Frankenstein'' that's consuming <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheuer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION> `` There's never any allegation that he did anything with corrupt intent.'' Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., a second-term member, said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s speech was `` a very important first step in gaining the confidence of the members. Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, D-Ark., said he would remain a staunch supporter of the speaker unless the facts show he did something wrong Constituents might not understand at first, he said. `` You get beyond the beltway, what have they got besides a perception?'' he asked. For some members, public perception would be the only issue, he said with a tone of disapproval. `` You know who they are,'' he said, licking his finger and raising it in the springtime air. Along with his appeal to his members, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has begun an effort to win support in the general public through careful management of his public statements. In fighting a charge that he accepted improper gifts from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>, a longtime friend and business partner who the committee suggested had interest in legislation, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has focused his defense on the $ 18,000 salary his wife received from the partnership _ a salary the ethics committee labeled a gift. `` The fact is my wife worked. She earned her pay,'' he told reporters at a news conference, at which he refused to answer questions which might dilute his message that he was a proud husband. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he would spend more time later discussing his book publishing deal, which the ethics committee said appeared to be a scheme to evade limits on outside income from speaking fees. The speaker received 55 percent royalties on his $ 5.95 paperback, `` Reflections of a Public Man.'' The committee found that 98 percent were sold in bulk to interest groups who bought the book instead of paying him a speaking fee. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s supporters told reporters that it was unfair to criticize the speaker for taking advantage of House rules, which clearly exempt book royalties from the limits. They compared it to the average citizen's right to take advantage of every break in the tax code. `` Do I think the speaker found a quite inventive way to finagle the rule? Yeah,'' said Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., chairman of the committee that wrote the royalty rule 12 years ago but who now criticizes the committee's interpretation Several Democrats said the speaker's troubles could remain even if there's no major sanction from the committee. The committee could recommend anything up to an expulsion from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, although that's not now contemplated. Of course, the general public gets its perceptions from a wide variety of sources besides their lawmakers and new reports. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> could not have been cheered that he made the monologue of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Tonight Show. `` A lot of people do n't realize it, but <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> is a very gifted guy,'' host <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Leno </PERSON> said Monday night. `` The trouble is, a lot of the gifts have n't been reported.'' Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, D-Mont., said ethics is a very serious issue with the public and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s toughest challenges lie ahead `` I think the speaker is in hip-deep water and the white rapids are straight ahead of him,'' he said. Ethics committee members said Tuesday the committee's work might last into June. House Republicans, with few exceptions, have adopted a strategy of refraining from criticizing the speaker's ethics while the case is still undecided But the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> is hoping <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s troubles make the public more receptive to its message that it is time to make Republicans the majority party for the first time since President <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>'s first term House Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., and Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Okla </LOCATION>., held a news conference Tuesday to announce their party's agenda and complain about the pace of legislation this `` It's time for Democrats to help govern or get out of the way,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar fell today against the Japanese yen, while the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s key index rose slightly to another record high. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed at 33,363.83, up 42.17 points, or 0.13 percent. The index set its previous high of 33,321.66 points on Tuesday, when it edged up 13.33 points. The dollar closed at 131.88 yen, down 0.22 yen from Tuesday's 132.10-yen finish It opened at 131.38 yen but generally moved up during the day, while ranging from 131.35 yen to 131.95 yen. Traders said the currency's lower opening in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> followed a drop on overseas markets, where discouragement over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic figures released late Tuesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> led to dollar-selling. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday that the nation's consumer price index in March rose 0.5 percent, up from February's 0.4 percent, while the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> housing starts in March fell 5.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.397 `` But market players -LRB- in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> -RRB- began buying back the dollar toward the end of the morning session for their position adjustments because they thought they had sold too much ahead of the report,'' said a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. There were not enough dollar-buying incentives to push the dollar above 132 yen, he added. On the stock market, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> index started higher following a 41.61-point gain in the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> overnight, said a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` Participants took the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic indicators positively as showing a slowdown in the nation's economy,'' he said. Such a slowdown now would ease fears of inflation, prompt expectations of lower interest rates and encourage stock investment. Lower <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates, however, make the dollar less attractive to foreign investors. The dealer added that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s political uncertainties `` have largely discouraged foreign and institutional investors, who hardly participate these days. Major players are only individuals.'' Today's trading was active, with first section volume estimated at 1.4 billion shares, up from Tuesday's 1.1 billion. Among gainers were steel and chemical issues.

<TEXT>
 Scientists at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> say their experiments with cold fusion prove the energy generated could not have come from a chemical reaction as some skeptics have suggested. The researchers revealed their findings Tuesday, one of several announcements made around the world related to the discovery of <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> chemist <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and British colleague <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON>. _ In <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, Italian scientists said they achieved fusion at room temperature with a different process than the one in the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> experiments, which used electrical currents in `` heavy water'' to trigger the reaction `` We have paved the way for a new road to fusion research,'' said <PERSON> Umberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Colombo </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alternative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>. _ In <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, a team of physicists said they also produced room-temperature fusion _ In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> said he wants to help <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alamos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> scientists duplicate his cold fusion experiments so the lab will collaborate with him on research The apparent discovery of cold fusion was announced March 23 by <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON>, who set off an international debate about whether the process was indeed fusion. <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> said they had achieved fusion using ordinary laboratory equipment at room temperatures. Standard experiments have used extremely high temperatures, making them impractical for large-scale energy production because they use more energy than they produce. Since the announcement, scientists have been trying to duplicate the experiment and its results. If fusion can be created as easily as <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> claim, scientists say, it could be a relatively inexpensive and virtually inexhaustible energy source. The Stanford finding came from a team of seven researchers led by <PERSON> Roert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Huggins </PERSON>, professor of material sciences. Displaying a simple experiment with palladium electrodes in tubes of heavy water and plain water in a plastic picnic basket, <PERSON> Huggins </PERSON> said the energy generated was not the result of any known chemical reaction. <PERSON> Huggins </PERSON> would n't speculate on why the experiment produced a 50 percent energy gain in heavy water, but he acknowledged the most likely cause was some kind of fusion process. `` We're seeing excess heat that's above and beyond any possible chemical reaction,'' he said. `` It means the effect is real and is substantial.'' The energy may result, however, from a different type of fusion than is commonly known, he said. <PERSON> Huggins </PERSON>' team ran five experiments over two weeks, using a tube of deuterium oxide, or heavy water, and a tube of plain water. If the experiments produced the same results, they said, it would indicate the energy was not from fusion. Instead, they found much higher temperatures from the heavy water, which meant the energy was not a chemical reaction because there is no essential chemical difference between the two kinds of water. Last week, two graduate students at the Univeristy of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said they had detected cold fusion in an experiment conducted with heavy water, but they could not get the same results using ordinary water. On Monday, <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> said the apparent cold fusion discovery had been partly verified by more than 60 university and private laboratories, but none has reported observing both the production of neutrons and the high level of heat that he and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> produced. The experiment at <LOCATION> Stanford </LOCATION> was not designed to measure neutrons. Neutrons are a tell-tale sign of fusion, the process powering the sun, in which tremendous amounts of energy are released when hydrogen atoms fuse. In contrast, conventional nuclear power plants use fission, the splitting of atoms.

<HEAD>Report: Pan Am Documents State Many U.S. Diplomats Canceled Seats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Large numbers of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats canceled seats on <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flights in the weeks before the bombing of Flight 103, according to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Congressional panel that saw internal <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> documents, a British newspaper reported today. The Independent, a respected daily, said documents sent to a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> panel probing the Dec. 21 bombing show that Christmas holiday traffic for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies had been heavily re-booked prior to the bombing. The report noted that relatives of those who died in the bombing have been angry that warnings of a possible bombing of a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were not made public. All 259 people on <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 and 11 on the ground were killed when the New York-bound <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 was blown up over the Scottish town of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>. The flight had originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` A private House of Representatives transportation subcommittee memorandum on the documents, which has been seen by The Independent, said that it had asked <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> for all internal documents relating to security procedures and for information about who knew of the threat,'' the paper wrote. `` Included among the documents it received were internal company telegrams and memoranda. The subcommittee memo said that one <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> internal request read that ` specific details on lost revenue for <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials' were required. A second was a request for ` public information guidelines' in view that about 80 percent of holiday traffic of embassy is re-booking. `` The subcommittee memo, dated 13 March, goes on to say that <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> needed to be asked what were ` the details of lost revenue since <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> was obviously keeping track of threat-related cancellations.''' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has denied that its officials, acting on the warnings, had thus avoided <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flights, the report said. Copies of what The Independent described as a `` supposedly secret'' alert bulletin from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> were posted on notice boards at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on or around Dec. 13. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> bulletin was drawn up after an anonymous caller to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> said a bomb attack would be made in the two weeks after Dec. 5. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> bulletin was sent to embassies so that they could inform foreign governments. Since the <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> bombing, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the Finnish police have maintained that the telephoned warning was a hoax. But no attempt was made to withdraw the bulletin in the days before the bombing, The Independent said. Relatives of those who died on Flight 103 have maintained it was inevitable that diplomats would act on the bulletin, warning friends and relatives and canceling <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> reservations. On April 7, <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> McManaway </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador-at-large for counterterrorism, told the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>: `` That is not true,'' the newspaper note. The report said <PERSON> McManaway </PERSON> pointed out then that 31 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government personnel died in the bombing. He added that the decision of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to post copies of the warning was not in accordance with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government policy and that steps were being taken to prevent it happening again.

<HEAD>Contras Charge Sandinistas Slaughter Rebel Backers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nicaraguan rebel leaders say the leftist government has broken recent peace accords by killing dozens of Contra supporters. The allegation received backing from the human rights group <ORGANIZATION> Americas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Sandinista government is massacring supporters of the resistance,'' <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Aristides </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said at the group's <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> headquarters Tuesday `` They are wiping out our entire social base.'' With elections approaching, the Contras charged that the Nicaraguan military has been slaughtering between 40 and 50 civilians during the past two months in northern <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, where the U.S.-backed rebels once found their strongest support. Sandinista soldiers, the Contras said, killed 13 rebel supporters in the town of Apantillo alone. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Watch </LOCATION>, which has frequently criticized the Contras, backed up the Contra version of events. `` We have written the Nicaraguan government and are waiting to see what they are doing about this,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendez </PERSON>. `` We can not dismiss them as isolated incidents any more.'' The Contras withdrew from the northern region after a recent series of peace accords, said <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, another of the seven rebel leaders. But that withdrawal left rebel supporters open to repression, he said. `` They are taking advantage of the truce and the peace agreements to eliminate all our supporters,'' <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said. Another charged raised at the Contra news conference was that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have mined roads along the Honduran and Costa Rican borders. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, set to oversee planned national elections next year violates <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> promises made at a meeting of Central American leaders in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> that a `` balanced'' commission would be created. He said Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and the national assembly controlled by the Sandinistas are planning to appoint and approve all five members. Two members were to be chosen by the opposition. `` This is no way to initiate the electoral process in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said. `` And we expect the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents to demand it be changed.'' In <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, the defense ministry reported Tuesday that Contra forces killed three people and injured two in an attack on a home in the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kama </LOCATION> area, 400 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Junior </PERSON> high school girls played with polymers, peered at a horse embryo and checked animal pulses in a day-long laboratory visit that <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> teachers hope will persuade them to seek careers in science. `` We never did all this stuff in class,'' <PERSON> Tasha </PERSON> <PERSON> Galbreath </PERSON>, 13, of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> said Tuesday in a break from comparing a rooster's pulse with her own `` My mother even wanted to come today, but I told her she's not coming.'' The annual `` Day in the Lab'' at the private college was started four years ago by women faculty members concerned about statistics showing fewer girls were choosing math and science courses. `` We wanted to show them science is something that women indeed do and something exciting and personal, not separated from their lives,'' said <PERSON> Merle </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON>, dean of natural sciences. This year's program was dedicated to <PERSON> Denice </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, a pre-med student who played an integral part in the event until her death Dec. 22 in the crash of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> on her return from a semester abroad. All three floors of the science building were decorated with balloons and turned over to the girls, who jumped rope and ran on treadmills to check their pulses, chewed gum to measure the rate at which sugar dissolves, heard lectures on AIDS and saw a horse fetus through an ultrasound machine at the nearby school farm. <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> said the college expected 30 girls in the program's first year but got 117. This year, the number of preregistrations climbed over 200 as word spread about such seminars as `` Superballs and Slime'' and `` Blood' n Guts.'' Several girls returned from previous years, bringing along friends, sisters and parents. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Longmeadow </LOCATION> science teacher <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Roz </PERSON>, who has participated three years, accompanied three students from his eighth-grade class, his daughter and two friends from her second-grade class. `` I've never worked with slime before,'' said <PERSON> Gina </PERSON> <PERSON> Potorski </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Roz </PERSON>' students, who mixed liquid polyvinyl alcohol and sodium borate into a putty. `` It's cool.'' She later mixed sodium silicate and ethyl alcohol to make a high-bouncing polymer called a superball. The college sends notices about the program to public and private schools in <LOCATION> Hampden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> counties. The event falls during spring break for most junior highs. <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> said the college geared the program to junior high girls because they were at a crucial age in their education. `` Before junior high, all students test out the same in levels of performance, enthusiasm, aptitude,'' she said. `` In junior high, differences appear between boys and girls.'' One factor in the difference, she said, could be that girls are subtly discouraged from studying math and science, a pattern the program is intended to break.

 The stock market has surged to a post-crash high, sparked by news that consumer prices rose 0.5 percent in March. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials shot up 41.61 points to close Tuesday at 2,379.40. It was the highest close since the October 1987 stock market crash.

 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' `` official witch'' has begun a letter-writing campaign to protest what she and other witches believe are violations of their civil rights. Letters of complaint, stemming from news reports linking a `` witch'' to a cult of drug smugglers connected with the ritualistic deaths of 15 people found near the <LOCATION> Texas-Mexico </LOCATION> border, have been sent to major newspapers and television networks from <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabot </PERSON>'s Salem-based group, Witches League for Self-Awareness. `` We are not satanists, we do not do black magic or any evil magic,'' said <PERSON> Cabot </PERSON>, who formed the 900-member group in 1986, shortly after the filming of `` The Witches of Eastwick,'' a movie witches said made them appear `` stupid.'' In group literature, the league is described as a `` national and international anti-defamation organization which is working to protect the civil rights, dignity and public portrayal of over six million Witches, Pagans and Pantheists.'' The witches complained they have been `` portrayed in an inaccurate, offensive and libelous manner which is in violation of our constitutionally guaranteed civil right to practice religious freedom, as well as freedom from harassment, discrimination, persecution, or the incitement of the public to form adverse opinions of members of a religious community.'' <PERSON> Cabot </PERSON>, dubbed the `` official witch'' by Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in 1975, said Tuesday that she and other witches are part of a legally recognized religion that is `` peaceful'' and devoid of the evil doings associated with witchcraft stereotypes. The recent complaints sent to news organizations such as <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> stemmed from news reports about the murderous cult of drug smugglers in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Mexican police have termed <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON>, the missing 24-year-old college student believed to be one of the cult leaders, a `` witch.'' She has been linked to the 15 victims of the cult, some of which were unearthed at a ranch south of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> border last week. `` It's very loose terminology,'' said <PERSON> Cabot </PERSON>. `` These were drug runners. What they were doing had nothing to do with witchcraft. Witchcraft has no evil gods.'' <PERSON> Cabot </PERSON> described witchcraft as a `` nature religion'' that uses a mixture of astronomy, astrology and psychic powers to heal and make things better. She said they use potions and cast spells to promote well-being and general good. `` We have families, we have children, I belong to Kiwanis and the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, you know,'' said <PERSON> Cabot </PERSON>, who once owned a witchcraft store in <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> and is now writing books. She said the group hopes to `` re-educate'' people through the complaints but added that they could someday take court action if they believe their rights have been seriously violated.

 A man dismantling a 180-foot radio tower fell from the top but landed without breaking a bone after grabbing guy wires on the way down, authorities said. <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glaze </PERSON>, a foreman on a steel crew assigned to take down the tower, slipped Tuesday when hooking up his harness, said Associate State Forester <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON>.

Witnesses said he fell straight down another 40 feet to a second guy wire. `` He hung onto it and rode it down,'' <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> said. `` It's amazing,'' he said. `` If he had to slip, that's the way to fall.'' Glaze, a Forestry employee, `` was pretty cut up and beat up'' but did n't break any bones, <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> said. Glaze was listed as stable late Tuesday at Baton Rouge General Medical Center.

<HEAD>Court Removes Asthmatic Child From Home of Smoking Parents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENTON, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 3-year-old girl with chronic asthma is living in a foster home because a judge ruled her parents were n't doing enough to keep her away from cigarette smoke <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> County </PERSON> social workers removed the girl from her parent's home last month and she remains in a foster home. The girl's name was not released. `` It's a critical situation,'' Circuit Judge <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON> said during a juvenile court hearing March 17. Wise placed the child under the authority of the social services department. `` It is not something that the social services or the medical people are doing on a whim or caprice. They're afraid she's going to die prematurely and unnecessarily if something is n't done,'' Wise said. Wise said the parents could regain custody of their daughter if they make changes in their lives. He granted them full visitation rights. The child was admitted to a hospital near her home on <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s eastern shore, across the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, at least half a dozen times over the past year or so, and on two occasions was transferred to <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> Once, she was admitted to the intensive care unit for treatment of serious respiratory problems associated with asthma. The child lived with her great-grandmother, her legal custodian from March 1987 to March 1988. <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> authorities had granted custody to the relative while the family was living in that state because the girl's parents could not afford to properly care for her. But in March 1988, <LOCATION> Caroline </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> authorities returned the child to her parents, who had moved to <PERSON> Denton </PERSON>. In January, the child's father lost his job and the family moved in with the great-grandmother. Until recently, the girl's parents and great-grandmother smoked. <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, a physician with <ORGANIZATION> Caroline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, testified that on at least two occasions, the girl was in severe respiratory distress when brought to the hospital. Ms. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said that tobacco, which can bring on an asthma attack, may have been a critical factor. `` My particular concerns about this child include that the family continued to smoke despite many warnings that this was not appropriate,'' Ms. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. `` I do know that they tried to smoke outside the home or at least they were reporting that to us. But because the smoke is carried on clothing and other articles and in the car, this simply is not measure enough.''

 The country's leading opposition politician, <PERSON> Lim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kit </PERSON> <PERSON> Siang </PERSON>, was released from prison today after being held without charge for 18 months. With the release of <PERSON> Lim </PERSON> and his son <PERSON> Lim </PERSON> <PERSON> Guan </PERSON> <PERSON> Eng </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Kamunting </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Detention </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION>, 120 miles north of this capital, the Malay-dominated government has freed all 106 people it arrested during an October 1987 crackdown. The government that year angered many ethnic Chinese, who generally maintain their separate culture and language, by assigning non-Chinese speaking teachers to Chinese primary schools. Prime Minister <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamad </PERSON>, himself a Malay, has said the 1987 arrests of opposition politicians, environmentalists, trade unionists, church workers, educators and others was necessary to prevent Malay-Chinese rioting. But Kit Siang described the last 18 months as `` a nightmare for democratic rights in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>.'' His primary concern now, he said, `` is to do all I can to restore public confidence in democracy and restore <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>'s image abroad.'' Both <PERSON> Kit </PERSON> <PERSON> Siang </PERSON>, who is Secretary-General of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and his son are members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and ethnic Chinese. Fellow <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> members <PERSON> Vethamuthu </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> and <PERSON> Karpal </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> were released a few months ago but were told they could not speak to the press, that they have to report to police if they leave their hometown, are prohibited from addressing public gatherings and must report to the authorities every month. <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON> has said that through their actions and speeches those arrested in 1987 had increased racial tension in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, where government policy promotes Malays' economic standing in a country long dominated by Chinese businessmen. Every business in the country must be partially owned by Malays, who also are given tax breaks for starting their own companies. Universities teach in Malay, which has been named the national language, and <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> has been named the state religion. The country's 17 million population is 55 percent Malay and 37 percent Chinese, with most of the remainder Indian. The races in this former British colony have argued periodically over language, cultural and other differences, but there has been no major unrest since 500 people died in Malay-Chinese rioting in 1969. When <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON> became prime minister in July 1981, 550 people were being held under the Internal Security Act, which allows imprisonment without trial. <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON> called for a review and released most of them. Deputy Home Affairs Minister <PERSON> Megat </PERSON> <PERSON> Junid </PERSON> <PERSON> Megat </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayub </PERSON> says 70 people are still held without trial under the act. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Lam </PERSON> <PERSON> Thye </PERSON>, also an ethnic Chinese and a member of parliament who has been the acting leader of the opposition and secretary general in <ORGANIZATION> Kit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Siang </ORGANIZATION>'s absence, called on the government `` to release all the other internal security act detainees or charge them in an open court of law.''

<TEXT>
 While the effort to clean oil-drenched beaches sputters to life, volunteers armed with dish soap are wearily trying to save birds marked for death by sticky goo from the Exxon Valdez. Outside a makeshift rehabilitation center in a college dormitory, already cleaned cormorants gingerly spread their wings to dry in the sun. Ducks bob in plywood-sided tanks. The smell of fish used as food permeates the air. `` The ones that make it this far, into those tanks, usually make it,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Masson </PERSON>, a volunteer from <LOCATION> Cullowhee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> `` If they're in there they'll probably be OK.'' Many do not survive after reaching the center, run by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bird </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a California-based non-profit corporation The center's executive director, <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkner </PERSON>, said 349 oil-coated birds have been brought in since the tanker rammed <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION> on March 24, spilling more than 10 million gallons of North Slope crude into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. Of the 349, 136 died from the oil's toxic effects, exposure, dehydration or loss of bouyancy. Twenty-two have been returned to the wild. Many are being held at the center because they might return to the oil-contaminated areas. By Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> had logged 1,850 birds found dead in the sound since the spill. But the true number of dead birds and animals will never be known because of the sound's vast distances and remote shorelines. Ms. <PERSON> Berkner </PERSON> said as the oil has spread, the effort to save birds has widened. She said the organization has opened a cleaning center in <LOCATION> Seward </LOCATION> and she was going to <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> to open another. Luckily, there were few ducks and shorebirds in the sound when the tanker hit the rocks. It was before the spring arrival of waterfowl. Ms. <PERSON> Berkner </PERSON> was unsure how birds migrating into the sound now might be affected. `` I think right now, let's wait and see,'' she said. `` We're hoping the slick will break up ... We're preparing for the worst and hoping for the best.'' For Ms. <PERSON> Berkner </PERSON>, this spill is not the first. Her first was in 1971, after two <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> tankers collided in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. `` I just went down and helped for two weeks. That two weeks turned into 18 years,'' she said. In Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, the birds are picked up in the sound by 43 boats under contract to <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>. The vessels also pick up dead birds for disposal. Once aboard the vessels, the birds are kept warm and given liquids. Each night, the day's haul is transferred to the cleanup center. In <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, the birds are checked for injuries, banded and held for washing. The workers use a popular dishwashing liquid. Inside the center, activity seems constant as seven paid staff members and the 20 or so volunteers rush to clean birds. Carpeted floors are covered with plastic. Notes are taped to walls. In the `` dirty bird'' room, candidates for cleaning wait in plywood enclosures with coarse wire floors. The boxes are covered with sheets to give the birds privacy. `` It takes two to 12 tubs of water to clean the birds,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, coordinator for the volunteers. Just rinsing the birds can take 45 minutes, she said. In the `` clean bird'' room, the birds are held in covered enclosures warmed by commercial pet dryers. Then they are observed in the tanks outside to ensure they can float and will not succumb to hypothermia. The tanks are an attraction for visitors and workers. `` This is what makes it worthwhile _ coming out here and watching the silly birds eating and splashing around,'' Ms. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Soldiers shot and wounded at least 17 Palestinians in clashes today, including 11 children who suffered mostly head injuries from rubber and plastic bullets, Arab hospital officials said. Today's violence occurred as soldiers and police beefed up security in the occupied lands and inside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to prevent riots or attacks on Jews during the seven-day Jewish Passover holiday, which begins tonight. A public opinion survey published by a newspaper indicated 65 percent of Israelis supported a peace plan by Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> that calls for Arabs in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to elect representatives for peace talks. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hamishmar </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said that Jewish settlers in the occupied lands have formed a committee seeking to stop the election plan, which they claim would `` bring about a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state.'' In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, soldiers clashed with stone-throwing youths today in the <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> and Nusseirat refugee camps, the village of <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hanoun </LOCATION> and a neighborhood in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Arab hospital officials said the wounded included six chidren age 14 or younger who were hit with rubber bullets in the head and face. Five other youths were struck with plastic or rubber bullets in other parts of the body. The officials said six people ages 17 to 30 also were injured with plastic bullets. In Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, police detained 27 Palestinians accused of involvement in stone-throwing riots after midnight, in which three policemen and two Arabs were injured, said the <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> police spokesman, <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandori </PERSON>. In the 16-month uprising, 439 Palestinians have been killed, most shot by soldiers quelling stone-throwing protests. Eighteen Israelis also have died. The <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said it conducted the public opinion survey on <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan April 12-16 in face-to-face interviews with a random sample of 656 Israelis. Sixty-five percent said they supported the elections plan and 31 percent were opposed, while 4 percent said they had no view, the newspaper said. No margin of error was given for the poll. A Western relief official in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said that about 40 percent of the wounded in the Palestinian revolt are now 15 and younger. `` In the beginning of the uprising, the average age of those getting shot was much higher,'' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

<TEXT>
 A Christian Science couple was found guilty of murder for allowing their 7-year-old diabetic daughter to die without medical attention because of their religious beliefs. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hermanson </PERSON>, 42, and his wife, <PERSON> Christine </PERSON>, 38, could be sentenced to three to seven years in prison under state sentencing guidelines. They were allowed to remain free until sentencing. No sentencing date has been set. A jury found the Hermansons guilty Tuesday of third-degree murder and child abuse in the 1986 death of their daughter, <PERSON> Amy </PERSON>. They had rejected a plea bargain agreement for 15 years' probation in exchange for a plea of guilty or no contest. `` We will be filing motions for a new trial,'' said defense attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>. He said he was `` disappointed and surprised'' at the verdict. The Hermansons were the first Christian Scientists in 20 years prosecuted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for denying a child medical care for religious reasons, church representatives said. Five other religious exemption cases are pending, three in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, one each in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. The defense said the case was about religious freedom and cited a 1975 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law that protects parents who withhold medical treatment from their sick children if they are `` legitimately practicing'' their religious beliefs. Prosecutors contended it was murder, saying the girl died after her parents ignored pleas to take her to a doctor and relied instead on prayer to heal her untreated diabetes. Christian Scientists rely on prayer instead of medicine to care for the ill and may call on church-accredited `` practitioners'' with expertise in spiritual healing. However, members may seek medical assistance without fear of sanctions. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Talbot </PERSON>, church spokesman from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said the conviction would tend to unify Christian Scientists. The church must `` do a fuller job of helping society understand that it has a wonderful gift in spiritual healing and it would be a loss for all of us to prosecute out of existence spiritual healing,'' he said. But <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Swan </PERSON>, a former Christian Scientist from <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> who began a campaign to fight religious exemption laws after losing a son to meningitis 12 years ago, called the verdict significant. `` It signals to the nation that society does not approve of this behavior, and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientists </ORGANIZATION> had better wake up and listen,'' she said. `` These jurors could not accept the notion that a child should be allowed to die of diabetes for which, everybody knows, there is a standard, very effective treatment.'' Last week, with the jury out of the room, a witness testified that both parents had sought medical treatment for themselves but not for their daughter. The jury never heard that testimony because the judge ruled that prosecutors had improperly withheld the information from defense attorneys.

<HEAD>Alert To Prevent Guerrilla Attacks During Passover</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> placed its security forces on high alert today to prevent guerrilla attacks during the Passover holiday, and thousands of Israelis traveled to beach resorts or headed home to be with relatives. The weeklong Jewish holiday commemorates the exodus of the ancient Israelites from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and begins at sundown Wednesday with a traditional meal known in Hebrew as a Seder. Thousands of police and border patrol reinforcements were deployed across the country, and police maintained a large presence in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s walled <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to prevent disruptions of religious services, a police spokesman said. The 16-month Palestinian uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> has increased the concern in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> about attempts by <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas to carry out attacks during the holidays. Police appealed to the public in a statement published in all newspapers to report suspicious people or packages. The army increased its forces to prevent guerrilla infiltrations across <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s borders, especially the northern frontier with <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. So far this year, 31 guerrillas have been killed in a dozen attacks on the northern border. An army spokesman would not give out details of troop deployments. The army organized Passover meals in military bases, but soldiers serving in the occupied lands will celebrate the meal in shifts and will be given grape juice instead of the traditional four cups of wine, an army spokesman said. Budget restrictions forced the army to cancel the headquarters Passover feast, which is traditionally held at a different base each year and is attended by the chief of staff and dignitaries. The army took austerity measures after asking the government for an additional $ 138 million to covere increased costs of quelling the uprising. In <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> participated in a symbolic Passover Seder organized by Soviet Jewish activists to thank the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for its efforts on behalf of Soviet Jews being refused permission to emigrate. Organizers set up a table on the sidewalk across the street from the embassy, serving wine and traditional Passover dishes. Israelis headed home to their families today, while others planned to spend the holiday weekend in resort areas such as the Sea of <LOCATION> Galilee </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Eilat </LOCATION>. Passover is <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s equivalent of the Christmas shopping season, and Israelis crowded shopping centers and supermarkets to do their last-minute shopping before stores closed this afternoon. During the holiday, many Jews abstain from eating bread or consuming other leavened products such as beer to identify with the ancient Israelites, who fled <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> so quickly they had no time to leaven yeast for bread. Many Israelis have carried out traditional spring cleaning, removing all bread and leaven from their homes. This morning, religious Jews performed the tradition of burning the last remaining bread crumbs outside their homes. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s ultra-Orthodox <LOCATION> Mea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shearim </LOCATION> neighborhood, children built a bonfire on the main street and dozens of young boys, most in shorts with their side-curls flying, were seen tossing bags of bread onto the fire. In <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bnai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brak </LOCATION> neighborhood, ultra-Orthodox Jews carried plastic bags of bread to barrels or open fields and set them alight. Others dunked pots and pans in barrels of boiling water to purify them of any bread.

 Attackers ambushed the first <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> convoy bringing relief supplies to rebel-held southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, destroying the lead vehicle and reportedly killing eight rebel escorts, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said today. <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Weathers </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said a driver and two assistants also were wounded in the Tuesday afternoon attack 14 miles west of the <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> base at <LOCATION> Kapoeta </LOCATION>. The 14-truck convoy was carrying 100 tons of food and relief supplies to the town of <LOCATION> Torit </LOCATION>, 100 miles west of <LOCATION> Kapoeta </LOCATION>. It was the first relief convoy to <LOCATION> Torit </LOCATION> under Operation Lifeline-Sudan, the U.N.-organized effort to stock more than 100,000 tons of food and supplies in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> before rain in May makes transportation virtually impossible. The effort is intended to avert another tragedy like that in 1988, when relief officials say about 500,000 people died from drought. The operation began April 1 after the government and the rebels agreed to allow aid to move unhampered through rebel-held and government-controlled land. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> did not say who they believed was responsible for Tuesday's ambush, but they said it was unlikely <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> rebels would attack their own members.

 About 70 protesters disrupted a <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting to denounce a proposed immigration service detention center before police broke up the demonstration. The protesters were in the council chambers when members arrived Tuesday night, and the meeting was recessed until about 20 police officers led the demonstrators away. No arrests or injuries were reported, but debris was strewn on the floor and signs were plastered on the walls. A private firm, working with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, has asked <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> officials for permission to renovate a warehouse to serve as a detention facility. The council is considering the proposal, but the issue was not on Tuesday night's agenda. It was unclear if the protesters belonged to an organization. A police dispatcher who answered the phone this morning said no one was available for comment.

 The state of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and two foundations have linked up to fight one of the country's highest illiteracy rates by putting teaching computers into every public elementary school within four years. Gov. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> said Tuesday that the <ORGANIZATION> Riordan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Rord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> will make an initial investment of $ 1.5 million to begin installing computers this fall. He said the foundations would raise an additional $ 5.5 million over the next three years. He said the state would provide about $ 1.5 million a year in matching funds. The computer learning system would be made available to kindergarteners and first-graders in the state's approximately 500 schools. `` We have a goal in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> for everybody to read and write. I think today we are taking a big step in that direction,'' <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> said he hoped to get the computer labs _ which include the computer work stations, listening library station and other working areas _ in place in about one-third of the state's 150 school districts by this fall. <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Julie </PERSON>, have promised to fight illiteracy in the state. Based on 1980 census data, state officials estimate that as many as 400,000 adults in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> have fewer than nine years of formal education and most of them are functionally illiterate. The state's population is 2.3 million. `` <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> will be the first state in the country, to our knowledge, to have such an extensive computer literacy system for its children,'' <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> said. `` Every child in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> should, when this program in place, leave the first grade knowing how to read and write.'' <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Riordon </PERSON> said his foundation has provided for similar computer learning systems in several <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> cities, and in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But he said this was the foundation's first statewide effort. The project is to use <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Writing to Read'' systems. The computers allow children to write anything they can say and read what they write. It also lets students learn at their own pace. `` If they are slow, it does n't criticize them,'' <PERSON> Riordan </PERSON> said.

 Thousands of students demanding the overthrow of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo battled riot police today with firebombs and rocks in at least 10 cities, and protesters attacked a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military base in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Police firing tear gas battled students in campus and street clashes marking the anniversary of the April 19, 1960, student revolt that toppled the <PERSON> Syngman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhee </PERSON> government. Violent protests were reported in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chonju </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chungju </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taejon </LOCATION>, Wonju, <LOCATION> Kangnung </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chunchon </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Iri </ORGANIZATION>. `` Execute <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo!'' and `` Yankee go home!'' students screamed as they beat drums and brass gongs. <PERSON> Yonhap </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> news agency, said about 37,000 students took part in protests at 112 colleges nationwide, but it did not say how many were violent. Police said they had no overall figures on the protests. Several police officers and students were injured, but police officials in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> said they had no details on injuries or arrests. The protests appeared to be the most serious in recent months. A band of protesters hurled about 20 firebombs into the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s Camp <PERSON> Isabell </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> during the night but caused only minor damage, police and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officials said. The protesters fled before they could be caught. Radical students claim the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> helps keep the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government in power and are demanding withdrawal of the 43,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based in the nation. Students have staged a series of attacks on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities in recent months. More than 1,000 students at <ORGANIZATION> Hankook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> staged a furious battle, pelting police with hundreds of firebombs and rocks. Police in fatigues and visored helmets fired scores of tear gas canisters and made several charges to force the protesters back. Similar clashes occurred at at least 12 other <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> colleges after police blocked students from marching into the streets. But a student call for evening protests in the center of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> was mostly ignored with just a few protesters yelling slogans on sidewalks before being quickly swept away by thousands of riot police. Student leaders urged students to imitate the example of the 1960 revolt. `` We must strike down the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> dictatorship and establish true democracy in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>,'' a leader at <ORGANIZATION> Hankook </ORGANIZATION> said as students cheered. The government put riot police on top alert nationwide to block protests. At least 20,000 riot police were deployed in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Riot units guarded key government buildings and some major intersections. Police officials also said security was increased near government buildings and embassies. The radicals frequently stage violent demonstrations and attack government offices. They lack popular support because of their extreme views, and they are not seen as a serious threat to the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government. The radical students, who represent a small, but powerful minority on college campuses, are trying to form an anti-government alliance with militant trade union groups campaigning for major wage increases and other concessions. About 1,000 striking electronic workers clashed today with riot police in the southeastern city of <LOCATION> Changwon </LOCATION> after a protest march. A major crackdown was launched on labor strikes after <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> warned last week that strikes threatened to hamstring the economy. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said strikes had cost $ 2.4 billion in lost production and reduced exports by $ 600 million this year. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, a former general, won presidential elections in December, 1987 and has helped introduce broad democratic reforms, but many Koreans still identify his government with his authoritarian predecessor, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>.

 The death toll reached 67 today from the derailment of a high-speed passenger train in which 12 cars jumped the rails and tumbled down a rocky embankment, officials said. Another 137 people were injured. Twelve cars on the New Delhi-bound express derailed Tuesday 280 miles south of the capital near <LOCATION> Lalitpur </LOCATION> while the train was traveling at up to 70 mph, said <PERSON> Mathew </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, the chief of railway safety. <PERSON> John </PERSON> said the two diesel-powered engines, first eight cars and the guards' car on the <ORGANIZATION> Karnataka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> remained upright on the rails. Authorities said the train began its journey Monday from <LOCATION> Bangalore </LOCATION>, 820 miles south of the accident site, and was running several hours late. Press Trust of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, quoting survivors, said the cars overturned when the speeding train braked sharply near a bridge. About 1,000 people were on board the train. `` The train was at a very high speed when I suddenly heard wheels screeching. Then there was a series of thuds and we found our coach overturning,'' passenger V.N. <PERSON> Murthy </PERSON> was quoted as telling the news agency. <PERSON> Murthy </PERSON>, 36, said a child was heading toward the restroom when the train derailed. `` She just got crushed,'' <PERSON> Murthy </PERSON> told the news agency. About 20 victims were killed instantly and the rest died shortly after arrival at <LOCATION> Lalitpur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Civil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, two miles from the accident site, <PERSON> John </PERSON> said. He said 137 people were seriously injured. The dead included four men from a 14-member <LOCATION> Karnataka </LOCATION> `` kabaddi'' team.

 An article about a high school valedictorian who has one child and is pregnant with another has been vetoed for the school newspaper, but the student will be allowed to speak at graduation, school officials said. <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, principal of <ORGANIZATION> Jack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday he refused to approve the story about <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mae </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, 17, because it was too personal. The article, written by a student reporter is titled `` Against all odds ... Student becomes valedictorian despite motherhood.'' It documents Miss <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s personal life and scholastic achievements. Miss <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> is a straight-A student who carries a full load of honors classes, including physics, calculus and economics. After graduation, she plans to study chemical engineering at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION>. She has two scholarships. She has been shuffled among relatives since her mother died and her stepfather deserted her and eight siblings. Since she has no one to baby-sit her 18-month-old daughter while she studies two to five hours a night, she said she keeps the child occupied with paper and pencil. `` She writes while I write,'' she said. Now, at five months pregnant, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> dreams of a `` middle-class home and a middle-class life.'' Miss <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said she doubted she would be allowed to give the valedictory address June 10 because of her pregnancy.

 Guards today pushed back about 1,500 students who tried to storm <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headquarters to demand democracy, and tens of thousands of protesters later called for political freedoms during a nearby rally. An estimated 15,000 students, workers, peasants, and others rallied late today in central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> square with banners eulogizing reformist leader <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON> and carrying slogans such as `` Long live democracy and freedom!'' It was the third day of such protests. One student speaker shouted, `` let <PERSON> Cixi </PERSON> retire,'' a reference to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 19th century Empress Dowager who continued to exercise autocratic rule even though in name she had retired. Students said he was really calling for the ouster of 84-year-old senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>. `` The old views and system ca n't satisfy the people anymore,'' one student yelled from a ledge on a monument to revolutionary heroes in the center of the vast square. In <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, more than 1,000 students marched for the third time in four days and campus walls were plastered with posters demanding freedom of speech and of the press, witnesses said. The demonstrators who tried repeatedly to enter party headquarters _ engaging plainclothes police in shoving matches _ dispersed before dawn today after about 500 police linked arms and marched toward them. The show of force by police appeared aimed at ending round-the-clock demonstrations since Monday by thousands of students in front of <LOCATION> Zhongnanhai </LOCATION>, the party headquarters, and the nearby <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> the </LOCATION> <LOCATION> People </LOCATION>, the seat of government. The demonstrations are the largest in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> since revolutionary leader <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> greeted huge rallies of radical leftist students in the late 1960s in adjacent <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, where about 10,000 people gathered Tuesday. There have been no reports of arrests. However, three student representatives who were allowed to enter <LOCATION> Zhongnanhai </LOCATION> early in the nighttime protest did not come out, students said. The compound houses party offices and official residences for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders. Students sitting outside the compound's ornate red-lacquered gate chanted, `` Come out, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>!,'' a reference to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s premier They also chanted slogans heard throughout the protests: `` Down with corruption, overthrow bureaucracy, long live the people!'' The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> later said some people in the crowd threw bottles and shoes at <LOCATION> Zhongnanhai </LOCATION> guards and that one was bruised in the cheek by a flying bottle. One student leader, <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said the students planned further actions every day through Saturday, when the government will hold a funeral in the Great Hall for ousted party chief <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>, a reformer who died Saturday of a heart attack. Protesters in Tiananmen Square had draped the monument to revolutionary heroes with wreathes and banners eulogizing <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> from about 20 <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> universities and two newspapers. The demonstrators demand a party reassessment of <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>, who was forced to resign in 1987 for failing to be tough on pro-democracy student demonstrators in 1986-87.

<TEXT>
 Defense Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense ministers today began talks likely to center on the politically sensitive issue of upgrading short-range nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, attending his first gathering of the 16-nation <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, was expected to press the allies for a new _ and stronger _ commitment to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plans to modernize the weapons. `` I think it is important that we go forward to modernize that force,'' he told reporters aboard his <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jet en route <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. He reiterated American opposition to <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> negotiations on reducing short-range weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` Now is the time, I believe, to move forward on conventional -LRB- non-nuclear -RRB- forces,'' he said. <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and some other <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> nations want <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to indicate its willingness to open talks on short-range nuclear weapons with the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>. Officials said it was unlikely the defense ministers would discuss the matter in any depth at this two-day meeting. There appears to be a desire on the part of the allies, officials said, to show cohesion in advance of a May summit between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders. The ministers also were not scheduled to make any key decisions on modernization, which is strongly opposed in some European countries. But they will be asked to reaffirm their backing to plans to upgrade the current Lance surface-to-surface missile. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> contends it needs a strong signal from the allies to lobby <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for money to continue a research-and-development program for the weapon. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders will meet at the end of May and discuss the modernization plans as part of a blueprint designed to guide the alliance in arms control and force planning in the coming years. The modernization issue has become increasingly sensitive in recent months. Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has said he wants to delay a decision on deployment of the new missile until 1991 or 1992 _ after elections in his country. <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> recently added to the uncertainty by saying it, too, wanted decisions put off until the early 1990s. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat said decisions on producing and deploying the missile were not expected for several more years. The Lance missile, introduced in 1972, will become obsolete in 1995. The missile has a range of 60 miles and its replacement would be extended to more than 250 miles, just under the limits of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty. The accord eliminates <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet land-based missiles with ranges of about 300 to 3,400 miles. There are currently 88 Lance launchers, most of them in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, commander of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s European forces, argued for modernizing the short-range missile force in an article Tuesday in the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. He said the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> `` has undertaken an extensive modernization program for -LRB- short-range nuclear -RRB- forces during the 1980s.'' <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> has drawn up a report that says replacing the missile will allow the Western alliance to make substantial reductions in nuclear artillery. The study was to be discussed by the defense ministers. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> contends it needs a nuclear arsenal as a deterrent to offset the enormous superiority the East has built up in conventional, or non-nuclear, weapons. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members are <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, which is not part of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s integrated military structure, does not attend the nuclear discussions. <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> takes part as an observer.

<HEAD>Mass. High Court Says Paramount Not Liable for Post-Film Violence</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Paramount Pictures and a movie theater ca n't be held responsible for the death of a teen-ager stabbed by a young man who had just seen a 1979 film about city gangs, the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has ruled. The victim's family sued <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Saxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, seeking damages on the grounds of wrongful death. It charged that Paramount and the theater knew `` The Warriors'' was inciting violence around the country. Three days before the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> slaying, according to court records, two other youths were killed near theaters showing the film in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oxnard </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. That same week, Paramount officers advised theaters showing the film to hire security guards and offered to pay for them The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> high court upheld the dismissal of the family's lawsuit by a lower court on the ground that the movie-maker and theater company had no `` special relationship'' to the dead youth and therefore had no duty to protect him from his attacker. In addition, the court rejected the family's contention that `` The Warriors'' was an incitement to violence. `` Although the film is rife with violent scenes, it does not at any point exhort, urge, entreat, solicit or overtly advocate or encourage unlawful or violent activity on the part of viewers,'' Justice <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> wrote. `` It does not create the likelihood of inciting or producing ` imminent lawless action' that would strip the film of First Amendment protection.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakubowicz </PERSON> filed the lawsuit in 1981 on behalf of his dead son, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 16. The youth was stabbed Feb. 15, 1979, at a subway station several miles from the theater by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, who was returning from seeing `` The Warriors'' at the Saxon Theater. <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, who sat through two showings of the movie, taunted Yakubowicz on the subway, imitating a line from the movie _ `` I want you, I'm going to get you.''

 <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bower </PERSON> was near his 5-year-old daughter when a pipe bomb hidden in a toothpaste container blew up, and he's thankful her injuries were not more severe `` We're very lucky,'' he said. `` We have a daughter. Many people have gone through much worse than this.'' Two men seen leaving the K mart store after the explosion were being sought for questioning. Police also interviewed employees and former employees of the store to try to find out why someone planted the bomb in the store. Authorities also were on the lookout for a second bomb. `` The potential for it happening again is always there, either through a copycat situation or the same individual again,'' said Detective Sgt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Kouns </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Marion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Erin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bower </PERSON> lost her left hand and may recover only partial sight in her left eye as a result of the Monday's explosion, doctors at <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said. She was listed in fair condition today and `` more than likely will move out of pediatric intensive care to a regular ward,'' hospital spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said. Her mood was quiet, he said. `` There may be some vision left in the left eye. The right eye appears to be all right, but the left eye has been cut open by the force of the blast and by flying debris,'' said Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunery </PERSON>, a specialist in ophthalmology, plastic and reconstructive surgery. `` Those injuries can heal with time and they can sometimes be repaired.'' <PERSON> Erin </PERSON>'s left hand could not be saved, but the muscles and nerves in the forearm are intact, said Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, a plastic surgeon. `` I do n't think it's beyond the realm of possibility or probability that she will ultimately have a prosthesis and be fairly successful with it,'' <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said. The girl's mother, <PERSON> Maurine </PERSON>, 31, was slightly wounded by flying bomb fragments, but no others were hurt in Monday night explosion at the store on <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>' northeast side. The bomb, hidden in a pump-type toothpaste dispenser, was concealed among packages of trash bags in the hardware section toward the rear of the store. The men wanted for questioning, both believed to be about 20 years old, drew police attention with their nonchalant response to the explosion. `` Usually people want to rush to see what's going on. These two gentlemen apparently left while everybody else was going in the opposite direction,'' <PERSON> Kouns </PERSON> said. Police released sketches of the men compiled from employees' descriptions The bomb, which was made of a pipe three-quarters of an inch thick and apparently filled with black powder, may have been powered by a battery and detonated when it was picked up from a store shelf, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>, resident agent in charge of the <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION>.

The documents, soaked in gasoline, belonged to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Miami-based company owned and operated by <PERSON> Marrero </PERSON>. Police suspect the documents were burned in connection with <PERSON> Marrero </PERSON>'s arrest in a sting operation earlier the same day. The fire broke out only hours after <PERSON> Marrero </PERSON>'s arrest, along with <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Villar </PERSON>, on cocaine distribution and bribery charges. They could face up to life in prison if convicted. <PERSON> Subic </PERSON> acknowledged that <PERSON> Marrero </PERSON>'s arrest made it impossible for the former <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> police officer to have started the fire. But the investigator speculated that <PERSON> Marrero </PERSON> could have passed an order to an associate to burn the company records. According to <PERSON> Subic </PERSON>, arson charges will be brought against whoever started the fire. State and federal firefighters worked for more than three days to control the blaze, which shrouded <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and much of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in a dense cloud of smoke. It caused $ 100,000 in damage, <PERSON> Subic </PERSON> said.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration faced sharp criticism today for not acting decisively enough in taking control of the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil spill, as senators called for new laws that would require the president to direct such cleanup efforts. `` There has never been a time when this situation was under control,'' declared Sen. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> environmental protection subcommittee, which convened a hearing on the oil spill recovery effort <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was `` slow to comprehend the magnitude of this disaster'' and valuable hours were lost after the March 24 spill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> when the spill might still have been controlled <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, said federal environmental laws need to be changed to require the president to either take over oil spill cleanup efforts or specifically to declare that the cleanup is being conducted properly through private efforts. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, the president's point man on the oil spill recovery, who was scheduled to testify before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel later, has said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rejected a federalization of the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> cleanup because of concern that such a move might affect <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s financial liabilities. The president has said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> is coordinating cleanup efforts. But in a round of opening statements, one senator after another criticized everyone involved in the cleanup, especially recovery efforts in the first days after the Exxon Valdez tanker ran aground, spilling 10 million gallons of oil into the pristine waters. `` From all accounts the cleanup crews initially ... acted more like the <ORGANIZATION> Keystone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cops </ORGANIZATION>,'' declared Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, R-R.I. <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON> said the recovery effort demonstrated `` fundamental shortcomings'' in state and federal government agencies as well as <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>. But he said he understood Brush's reluctance to take a more aggressive role, saying he had been told it stemmed from disputable legal advice and not from White House disinterest. But <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration as well as the industry `` have been unbelievably slow to appreciate the magnitude of the response'' needed to deal with the spill, the worst in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history which now affects thousands of square miles. Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, although not critical of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> directly, has repeatedly called for greater federal involvement immediately after the accident occurred. `` I'm disappointed the president did n't see it that way,'' said <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>. But Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appeared to have made a decision early on to leave the cleanup effort to <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>. `` The magnitude of this disaster did n't strike <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> until it was way too late,'' he added. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said the effects of the spill will last many years and that the total price tag coud exceed $ 1 billion in cleanup and recovery. In an attempt to demonstrate the magnitude of the spill, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said the area threated with oil contamination is the size of three Great Lakes systems and if it had occurred in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> the oil today `` would be almost down to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>'' In addition to <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, the subcommittee also was scheduled to hear from <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON>, who has been critical of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s handling of the spill, and <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON>, chairman of the giant oil company Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, was scheduled later today to fly to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> for a four-day tour, his first visit to the area contaminated by the March 24 spill. <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>'s department is charged with planning long-term recovery efforts for the region's wildlife and public lands. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> announced a joint $ 6 million, three-year research program with the petroleum industry to develop better recovery and cleanup equipment and methods for large oil spills. The <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> secretary has characterized the recovery equipment in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> as little more than `` tinker toys'' and totally inadequate for dealing with a spill of the magnitude that occurred in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> when the Exxon Valdez tanker ran aground. He said the inadequacies of the recovery equipment were demonstrated when containment booms broke repeatedly from the force of the waves and syphoning equipment was so slow it hardly made a dent in the amount of oil in the water. <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> said the department and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> would evenly divide the cost of the three-year research effort, which is aimed at developing and testing new oil burning techniques, new high-speed steerable booms, and more advanced skimmer technology for clearing oil from ice-laden waters. Various chemicals, some of which are supposed to disperse oil and some to keep it together, also will be tested under the program, department officials said. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it was planning to step up inspections at offshore oil drilling platforms to check whether the industry `` is prepared to respond'' to an oil spill emergency. A report on the inspections is to be presented to <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> late next month.

 MA ` AN, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Police and soldiers fanned out across south <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> today to restore order after rioters battled police, looted buildings and erected stone barricades on a main highway. Residents blamed the outbreak on price increases mandated by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for a meeting with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, told reporters `` everything is under control.'' He said the disturbances were the result of the austerity measures. At least 18 people were reported injured in the rioting that broke out Tuesday in Ma ` an, a city of 25,000 about 120 miles south of <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, and spread to other towns along the highways linking the capital with the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Aqaba </LOCATION>. The violence continued Tuesday night, but police and soldiers moved into the region today and restored order with a curfew in Ma ` an. On Tuesday, thousands of rioters in the city attacked banks, burned tires, smashed cars and battled police. Minor demonstrations were reported today in the city of <LOCATION> Kerak </LOCATION> and at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jordan </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>. In the capital, Crown Prince <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> told foreign reporters at the palace that six civilians and 12 policemen were wounded Tuesday in Ma ` an. The crown prince, King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s brother, is acting head of state while <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> is visiting <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yousef </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Azem </PERSON>, who represented Ma ` an in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s now-suspended <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, said from <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> that about 25 people were wounded. The crown prince indicated there had been some arrests but gave no number. Tanks, armored vehicles and police cars were parked every few miles along the important north-south Desert Highway leading to Ma ` an. At several checkpoints, police stopped all vehicles to question drivers. On Tuesday, protesters blocked the highway north of Ma ` an at several spots with piles of rocks. `` Civilians here have called it <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s intefadeh of prices,'' said a security officer in Ma ` an, using the Arab term for the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. However, the crown prince suggested the riots were a product of `` extremist exploitation.'' He identified the instigators as `` some of the bearded gentlemen'' _ an apparent reference to Moslem fundamentalists _ who are `` very influential over the groups in the street.'' Demonstrators said the protests were triggered by a government announcement Sunday that prices of gasoline, vehicle fees, telephone calls and other items would rise by 10 percent to 50 percent immediately. The increases are part of an economic accord with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> to restructure the country's $ 6 billion foreign debt. Last month, similar IMF-mandated price increases in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> led to rioting in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> and its slums that left at least 300 people dead. `` The main reason for this rioting is because of the price increases,'' said a hotel worker in Ma ` an. `` The government had better believe that we are starving. The people of the south are starving.'' The price increases followed months of deteriorating economic conditions caused by a foreign exchange crisis that last year forced the government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Zaid </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON> to devalue the currency. The price increases are part of a government effort to trim spending. Gasoline prices rose by 25 percent to $ 1.65 a gallon, and the cost of cigarettes jumped more than 40 percent to $ 1.57 a pack. Cooking gas, alcoholic beverages and telephone service also rose. Some workers make as little as $ 93 a month, although wages of $ 185 to $ 370 are more common. Many Jordanian families have six to 10 children.

 Bureaucracy, slow donor support, bad planning and the civil war have forced organizers to scale down a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> relief effort to save millions of people in the south from starvation or malnutrition. Attackers on Tuesday ambushed the first convoy bringing supplies to rebel-held southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, destroying the lead vehicle and killing eight rebel escorts, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, reported today. Even before the ambush, organizers said Operation Lifeline-Sudan now expects to provide less than half the 100,000 tons of relief goods believed to be necessary if a second consecutive summer disaster is to be avoided. When the relief effort began April 1, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> planned to stockpile supplies at strategic points in southern and southwestern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> for people escaping famine caused by the 6-year-long civil war in the region. Relief goods must be in place before the summer rains turn much of the rural south into lakes and isolate areas where the refugees gather. Almost three weeks after the starting date, no deliveries have been made by trains or <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> barge convoys, the project's bulk carriers. Airlifts have been delayed because planes promised by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other Western donors have not arrived. <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Weathers </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said the 14-truck convoy to the town of <LOCATION> Torit </LOCATION> was attacked Tuesday afternoon 14 miles west of a rebel base at <LOCATION> Kapoeta </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> did not say who they believe was responsible for the ambush, but they said it was unlikely rebels were responsible because of the rebel escort. The officials said that overland route would be suspended but other relief operations would move forward. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> organizers have given up their original goal of completing the $ 132 million operation by the end of April and say it will continue as long as allowed by the rains, which normally begin in May. Food has been stored in some areas of the three southern regions, but supplies in other towns are precariously low and the possibility of replenishing them appears slim. Project director <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wannop </PERSON>, local head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Development Program, insisted `` there are signs of momentum gathering'' and expressed hope that half the 100,000 tons of food and medicine would be within reach of 2.3 million southerners by the end of April. Only about 26,000 tons are in the stockpiles now, he said. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials say 100,000 face starvation without emergency supplies. Relief agencies estimated 250,000-500 ,000 southerners died in 1988 from the war and the famine it created To attract international attention, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Children's Fund flew in actress <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON>, its goodwill ambassador, and some of the bad planning became evident. In <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, she was driven around aimlessly for an hour by escorts who had not been told her schedule. Operation Lifeline-Sudan sometimes appears to face an endless list of problems. After promising two military C-130 transport for the airlift, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> backed out because <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officers thought the planes might be exposed to hostile fire. The <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> said it would charter two of the cargo jets but there is no indication when that will be done. Shortages of fuel have grounded available planes and disabled trucks. Bureaucracy contributes to the bottlenecks with such policies as requiring relief workers to obtain travel permits. Customs problems continue despite Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>'s promises at the March conference to eliminate them <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s cumbersome bureaucratic pace was slowed even more by the advent April 7 of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>, the holy month when Moslems abstain from food and drink in daylight hours. <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> and the rest of northern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> are Arab and predominantly Moslem. The civil war grew out of demands by black southerners, most of whom are Christians or animists, for autonomy and a better economic deal. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, regional director of <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> for the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, said: `` There have been lots of disappointments: that the donor community has been slow in responding, that the military actions have not diminished, disappointments with the logistical and mechanical obstacles.''

 Two crewmen missing since their freighter sank Monday morning might still be alive because the area they are believed to be drifting in is warmed by the Gulf Stream, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials said today. Twenty-three sailors were rescued after the Star of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> sank in story seas about 400 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter was to continue searching for the two men at least through the day, said Petty Officer <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawley </PERSON>. On Tuesday, a search plane reported spotting one missing crewman, but it was not clear whether he was alive. <PERSON> Crawley </PERSON> said rescuers have not found any further sign of him. `` We feel they're still out there or else we would n't be searching,'' said Chief Petty Officer <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> headquarters. <PERSON> Crawley </PERSON> said officials believe the men may still be alive because of warm currents. One of the men was wearing a life jacket when he was swept out of a life raft, survivors said. They said the other man may have injured himself jumping from the ship. It was unclear what caused the ship to sink, said Petty Officer <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Rives </PERSON>. The Ravenscraig, a freighter, picked up the 23 multinational crew members Monday after rescue planes spotted a lifeboat and a life raft and guided the 950-foot vessel to them, <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said. An empty life raft also was recovered. The men suffered only minor injuries. The 500-foot Star of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> was bound for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, when crew members reported about 9 a.m. that it began taking on water in 12-foot seas and winds of 30-35 mph, <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A councilman in <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> said today that police, who have largely blamed the weekend's soccer disaster on hooliganism and drunkeness, are trying to cover up their own incompetence. The charge came while police and government officials launched inquiries to determine how a surging crowd was allowed to crush and suffocate people at the soccer match, leaving 95 dead. The Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today quoted police officials as saying they were disgusted by reports portraying Saturday's disaster at <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> stadium in <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION> as a consequence of their failure to control the crowd. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Middup </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yorkshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, the local police union chapter, claimed drunkenness contributed to the uncontrolled crush of <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION> fans outside the stadium just as the match between <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Nottingham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> was beginning. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION> police said today that some fans were arrested before the game for public order offenses but refused to give any details. To relieve the dangerous crush outside the stadium, police ordered that a locked gate be opened. The fans poured into a standing-room `` terrace'' area already crowded with other <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> fans, and victims were trampled or crushed to death against a 10-foot-high steel-mesh fence. `` We are quite convinced that a lot of the fans _ many, many hundreds of them outside that gate _ had been drinking very heavily,'' he said on <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> television. Given the behavior police faced outside the stadium, <PERSON> Middup </PERSON> said, `` I do n't know what we are supposed to do and why it should all be our fault.'' He also said officers saw people picking up victims' belongings. The Times said other police officers reported seeing <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> fans picking the pockets of the dead. <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Keva </PERSON> <PERSON> Coombe </PERSON> called the police allegations `` baseless, malicious and wicked'' and said they `` are contradicted by the observations of thousands of people who were present, from all sections of society.'' `` None of these allegations were made at the time and any lawyer will know that they have the hallmarks of an attempt to create a cover story to cover for their incompetence,'' he said. In another development today, Soviet soccer star <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> Blokhin </PERSON>, who plays for an Austrian team, condemned the `` deplorable conditions'' of the <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION> stadium, the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` I believe it is an outright crime to pack spectators into standing sectors like sardines in a can,'' <PERSON> Blokhin </PERSON> was quoted as saying. The disaster has focused attention on <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s antiquated soccer stadiums and the riot fences located in standing-room-only areas near the soccer goals. News reports have centered on speculation the deaths may have been caused by the decision of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION> police Supt. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> to order the gate unlocked. Nine survivors of Saturday's disaster are suing <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION> police and the owners of the stadium, alleging negligence. Police officials quoted by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> expressed disgust at the behavior of <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION> fans as officers attended to the victims. The paper quoted one unnamed senior police officer as saying: `` As we struggled in appalling conditions to save lives, fans standing further up ... were openly urinating on us and the bodies of the dead. `` As policemen on the pitch tried to save the injured, they were hampered by other <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> fans running up, kicking and punching them,'' the officer said. On Tuesday, a senior judge, Sir <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, began a government-ordered inquiry into the disaster by touring the stadium. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said it was too early to pinpoint major issues of the inquiry but said he would look at the effect of liquor on the fans' behavior The death toll rose Tuesday to 95 with the death of a hospitalized 14-year-old boy. Nineteen injured fans remained hospitalized today, nine in intensive care, hospital officials said. British soccer fans have a reputation for violence _ rioting <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> fans are blamed for <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s 1985 <LOCATION> Heysel </LOCATION> stadium disaster when 39 mostly Italian fans died. As a result, rival fans have been segregated and fenced in at <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> and other British grounds to keep them from fighting and running onto the field.

 A nationwide shortage of math and science instructors probably will continue into the next century, but alternative teacher training programs help offset the shortfall, a study has found. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will need about 20,000 new math and science teachers each year for the next decade, says <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Darling-Hammond </PERSON>, lead author of a <ORGANIZATION> Rand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> study on teacher education, which was released Tuesday. The study found that postgraduate training programs for career switchers, retirees and other non-traditional teacher recruits produce about 2,000 science and math instructors a year, or 10 percent of the shortfall. Less than half of the demand will be met by graduates of traditional education programs by 1992, the study adds. Ms. <PERSON> Darling-Hammond </PERSON> noted that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> estimates that about 30 percent of the people teaching math or science are not fully prepared. `` Quite often a physical education teacher will be asked to teach biology because some administrators view the curriculum requirements as similar,'' she said. This produces recurring problems with poor student achievement in the sciences and math, she said. `` Our very best math students, the top 5 percent of our students, score below the average for students in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Darling-Hammond </PERSON> said. `` If we do n't improve our ability to produce large numbers of well-trained people in scientific and technical fields, we will not be able to compete economically in the international marketplace,'' Ms. <PERSON> Darling-Hammond </PERSON> said. The biggest obstacles reported in recruiting and retaining good science and math teachers are similar to those for teachers in general: relatively low pay, student disciplinary problems, poor student motivation, excessive paperwork and assignment to non-teaching chores. The Rand study, `` Redesigning Teacher Education: Opening the Door for New Recruits to Science and Mathematics Training,'' generally found that there are two ways to increase the supply of entrants to an occupation. `` Increase the benefits or attractions to the field or reduce the costs of entry. Efforts to improve teacher salaries and working conditions are intended to address the first of these ... -LRB- and -RRB- non-traditional programs attend to the second of these strategies: They aim to lower the financial and opportunity costs of preparing to teach.'' Non-traditional programs focus on training people who did not consider math or science teaching while they were in college. But a Rand survey of 64 such programs, comprising most of the programs nationwide, found significant differences. In some cases, programs have been closed for lack of funding since the survey was done two years ago. The extent of study required varied from as few as 16 weeks to two years or more, requiring completion of as few as nine course credits to as many as 45. Some provide student teaching experience, but not all.

 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> arrived today to oversee a new round of peace talks between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, but negotiators for both sides said they are not prepared to compromise. At an airport press conference, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> acknowledged that the adversaries are `` are still rather far apart'' but said it is important to keep the eight-month process going. The two countries have been trying to work out a permanent peace accord since they signed a cease-fire in August, ending eight years of war that killed or injured at least 1 million people. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> declined to predict the outcome of the new negotiations. However, he said the mere fact that the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> agreed to come to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> showed their interest in reaching an agreement. Before leaving <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> early today, Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would not yield in its demand that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> first withdraw its troops from Iranian territory. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claims that Iraqi forces still hold 1,065 square miles of Iranian territory. By <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> estimates, however, only about 260 square miles remain under Iraqi control. On Tuesday, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> accused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of sabotaging the talks by `` procrastination, maneuvering and insincerity'' and warned that the negotiations `` could eventually collapse.'' He was due in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> today. The talks are scheduled to start Thursday afternoon at the Palais des Nations, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, after separate meetings between Perez de Cuellar and each of the two ministers. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief said the duration of the talks depended on the two sides. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has been pressing for early dredging of the <LOCATION> Shatt-Al-Arab </LOCATION> waterway along the border. The channel, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s outlet to the sea, is clogged by sunken ships, weapons, and silt.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> expects to write off about $ 2.8 billion in losses if shareholders approve a deal to scrap the controversial <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> nuclear power plant. The utility announced Tuesday that it had received permission from the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to deduct such losses. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> had earlier permitted such a deduction under a deal that collapsed last year. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> ruling came one day after the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> staff reported that the $ 5.5 billion plant meets all federal safety requirements and is `` operationally ready.'' <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lando </PERSON> <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> tentatively set a vote on the full-power license for Thursday and all indications are the license will be granted. However, the action may be largely symbolic. Under the latest shutdown plan, <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> has agreed not to put the license to use until its shareholders vote on the negotiated settlement with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authorities </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors. Under the new agreement, <PERSON> Shoreham </PERSON> would be sold to the state for $ 1 in exchange for a decade of annual rate increases of up to 5 percent to ensure financial stability for the company. The shareholders must vote on or before June 15, and <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Catacosinos </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> Monday that the utility's board will recommend that shareholders approve the deal. <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> and the state would then seek to have <PERSON> Shoreham </PERSON>'s license transferred to the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> would oversee decommissioning and dismantling of the plant. The plant was begun more than 20 years ago and finally completed in 1985. Opponents have battled it, with both <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials refusing to participate in emergency planning. The state and county officials contended that no emergency plan would have been workable on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, where the plant is situated, because of the geography, highway system and population concentration.

 Two men believed to be planning a terrorist attack on <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> have prompted a full-scale alert by state and local police, a newspaper reported today. The Star-Ledger of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, citing unidentified sources in the casino industry and law enforcement, reported that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> advised local authorities that the men were being dispatched from an unspecified Arab country to launch a terrorist assault on an unspecified target in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The attack reportedly was to be a retaliation against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for its April 14, 1986, bombing of <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s headquarters.

Sources told the newspaper that the terrorists were supposed to be traveling from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to the casino resort with accomplices ready to help them escape through <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The `` operating window'' for the assault was reported to be April 14 through April 20 _ Thursday. State Police Superintendent Col. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Pagano </PERSON> refused to confirm or deny the alert. However, marked <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> cars have taken up positions on the three main entrance roads into <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and nonuniformed <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> detectives strengthened their surveillance at the city's 12 casinos, the newspaper reported.

The hotel will have five revolving restaurants, a main 2,000-seat conference room, smaller conference rooms, interview rooms, banquet halls and public catering facilities, it added.

 April 12 The <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s corruption: Toppling one reputed Mexican drug kingpin will only be valuable if it signals a long-term commitment by the Mexican government to fight corruption and drugs. Otherwise, the names will simply change as the status quo continues. It would clearly be in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to wage a continued assault; a recent report by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> cited <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' top source for heroin and its No. 2 source for marijuana. But it is in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s interests as well _ not just to win favorable treatment over international debts and such, but because of the tremendous social and political costs of corruption. All nations in which drugs have become big business must fear the sort of stranglehold that drug traffickers achieved over the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government. Elements in the recent arrest of <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON> offer the kinds of encouraging signs the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been looking for from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. In the past, Mexican government officials frequently have responded testily to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charges of official corruption in connection with drug trafficking. But -LRB- last -RRB- week, several officials were arrested, and Mexican Attorney General <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> discussed the corruption aspect. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s president, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, has frequently spoken out against drug trafficking. But one of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s frequent responses to criticism has been that it is the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' consumer demand for drugs, especially the popularity of cocaine, that drives the trafficking. In <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, it will take a great deal of political will _ and skill _ for President <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' anti-corruption efforts to succeed in the face of longtime practice. If they do work, however, they will benefit both countries _ institutions and citizens alike.

 April 17 The <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> on the British soccer tragedy: A soccer match, a time for recreation and merriment, instead turned into a maelstrom, as nearly 100 persons were killed in the crush of spectators at a match Saturday in <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The episode teaches important lessons about both the importance and danger of sports, and it demonstrates the need for measures to prevent a recurrence. It occurred as fans surged forward in overcrowded stands. The victims were crushed and suffocated in a `` terrace,'' or standing-room-only pen, at the end of the stadium. Thousands of eager, excited fans had gathered at the stadium hoping to watch the game. ... For too many Britons, sports is also something to fight about. English soccer clubs were banned from <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> tournaments in 1985 after 39 people were killed in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> when backers of a British team rioted during a match with an Italian team. If <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sports has been marred by drugs -LRB- and, now, possibly, gambling -RRB-, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> soccer has been marred by violence. While hooliganism in the stands has been an occasional problem during football, baseball and other games in this country, crowd control is taken seriously by most big-time sports executives here, as it should be.

The executives, found guilty of conspiracy and wire fraud, face long prison sentences _ up to 40 years _ and large fines. Prosecutors argued that the two were aware a consultant was paying a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> procurement official for inside information that led to <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> landing a $ 24 million contract. The significance of the conviction, according to assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronica </PERSON>, is that it tells executives `` they can not put things into motion and feign ignorance and attempt to wash their hands of guilt.''

Shareholders end up footing the bill for fines; prison time, however, is a real attention-getter.

Federal studies suggest that water from at least 10 percent of faucets in each school contains high lead levels; 20 parts per billion poses a health risk.

The culprits are old and new plumbing and drinking fountains that are lead-lined or have lead solder. The danger is particularly great in fountains or faucets that are used intermittenly and thus allow the water to stand in the pipes, as in the case in schools. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> is recommending that at least some of the fountains in every school in the nation be tested. ... This is a potentially serious problem, but it is a problem that can be dealt with.

 Members of a private commission that recommended federal pay increases said Wednesday they are glad President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed a raise for judges but disappointed he did not also call for more money for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and top government officials. `` We were disappointed by what he decided to do right now,'' political scientist <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> at a hearing on recommendations of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is quite clear the president does n't want to grapple with the situation in the aftermath of what happened in January and February,'' <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON> said. `` He is trying to find ways simply not to look at the mess right now.'' Before leaving office in January, former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> approved a government commission's recommendation calling for a 50 percent increases for judges, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and high federal officials. The proposal aroused a storm of public criticism and was rejected by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in February. The private commission also recommended raises for all three branches of government in a report submitted to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on March 29. The president, however, proposed a 25 percent hike for judges only, in an ethics proposal he unveiled April 12. He put off the question of other increases. Former <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>, now chairman of the private commission, said, `` We welcome the president's initiative in respect to raising the pay of federal judges We believe, however, that increases are essential for the other branches as well.'' `` Pay for the public servants of government must rank substantially higher in the range of government's budget priorities,'' <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> told the committee. <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON> said that on the basis of the commission's meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> when they submitted their report he believed that `` before long he will want to work out something that will cut across all branches.'' Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee, said, `` While much debate has focused on the role which compensation plays in the government's ability to recruit and retain, the recommendations of the commission are much broader in scope than a single plug for a pay raise for executives, judges or anyone else. <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> told the committee that `` it would be a misreading of our intention and conclusions to place undue emphasis on one area _ such as pay _ to the exclusion of others.'' One of the most important things, he said, is a recommendation that Cabinet officers and agency heads be given `` greater flexibility to administer their organizations. ... In short, we urge greater delegation of personnel authority and easier procedures for hiring and firing.'' The commission also called for `` a partial, but decisive, reversal of the trend extending over many years for an increased number of political appointees _ now standing at over 3,000'' in the executive branch.

<HEAD>Fish Oil Lowers Mild High Blood Pressure</HEAD>

 Large doses of fish oil can relieve mild high blood pressure and may work as well as some commonly used prescription drugs, a study concludes. Many claims have been made about the seeming benefits of fish oil on the heart and circulatory system, but convincing data to back up these beliefs have been scarce and many experts remain dubious. The latest study, conducted on 32 white males, provides some of the strongest evidence yet to support at least one of fish oil's reputed merits Fish oil seemed to work about as well as two mainstays of blood pressure therapy _ diuretics and the beta-blocker drug propranolol. However, the amounts taken were much higher than the doses usually suggested by manufacturers of widely advertised brands of fish oil capsules. In fact, when taken at the recommended doses, the oil did not change the subjects' blood pressure. Other studies have suggested that fish oil can prevent heart disease by repairing damaged arteries, lowering dangerously high cholesterol levels and slowing the blood's tendency to clot. Drs. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON> and <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> FitzGerald </PERSON>, the researchers who conducted the latest study at <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, have been among fish oil skeptics. Both said they were surprised to find that it seemed to work. But they cautioned that people should not exchange their blood pressure pills for fish oil until doctors know more about its effectiveness and safety. `` For the time being, we are taking a cautious approach and not recommending it as a therapy for high blood pressure,'' <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON> said in an interview. `` Certainly I would n't throw away my propranolol and start taking fish oil instead.'' At <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Beth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasternak </PERSON> said doctors should wait for the results of several large studies now under way before making up their minds about fish oil. However, he added, `` This research is consistent with other experimental evidence, and this is an important break in that regard.'' `` Fish oil is not not the drug of choice for treating hypertension, but the study shows that that dietary change can markedly reduce our risk of high blood pressure,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Milner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Center </LOCATION>. According to the latest report, published in Thursday's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, a month of fish oil lowered the men's average blood pressure from the starting point of 139 over 94 to 132 over 90 However, to achieve this, they had to take three tablespoons of herring oil daily. The oil, which caused belching and a lingering fishy aftertaste, is not widely available because it spoils quickly. The amount taken is the equivalent of 50 fish oil gel capsules, like those sold in supermarkets and drug stores. <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON> said taking this many capsules is not practical because big doses of them often cause stomach upset. The doctors also caution that people should not substitute cod liver oil, which contains too much vitamin A and D and not enough omega-3 fatty acids. Oily ocean fish, such as herring and mackerel, are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, the particular variety of fish oil that appears to be good for the heart. The herring oil used in the study was about 30 percent omega-3. The doctors noted that more concentrated kinds of fish oil are becoming available that may allow people to get fish oil's benefits while taking less. The latest research `` opens the possibility that this type of therapy may ultimately find a place in the treatment of high blood pressure,'' said <PERSON> FitzGerald </PERSON>. `` It's an important first step in that direction.'' The researchers cautioned that more study will also be needed to see if fish oil lowers blood pressure for blacks and women as well as for white men.

<TEXT>
 West German media have stumbled through an awkward observance of <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s birth 100 years ago, reflecting a hesitance among many to come to grips with the once-revered Fuehrer. The unsavory anniversary has been noted in a disjointed series of newspaper portraits, historical analyses and opinion polls that explain only pieces of the phenomenon that brought death for millions during World War II and the Holocaust, and the enduring division of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. One radio network in <LOCATION> Hesse </LOCATION> state planned a discussion of residual right-wing extremist tendencies for Thursday's anniversary of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s birth in the Austrian village of <LOCATION> Braunau </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s southern border. But other media seemed more poised to react to expected demonstrations by the neo-Nazi fringe than to put the occasion into perspective for a nation still branded by crimes committed before many people were born. The <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television network announced two months ago it would not have any documentaries on the anniversary, which it said was `` not the right day to remember a criminal.'' Newspapers and magazines across the entire political spectrum have made virtually no mention of plans by neo-Nazi leaders like <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuehnen </PERSON> to celebrate <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s centennial. Federal officials in the capital have been careful to avoid discussion of the infamous occasion. <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Michael-Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Butz </PERSON> was asked what steps federal forces have taken to ensure the safety of potential targets of neo-Nazi actions. `` We have taken adequate precautions where needed,'' he replied, declining to elaborate. Among the press reviews of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s role in German history, the most comprehensive and critical analysis has been offered by <ORGANIZATION> Der </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spiegel </ORGANIZATION> magazine. The glossy weekly devoted its April 10 cover and 20 pages to try to explain `` The terrorist of the century'' and how he has affected today's <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> published in detail the results of a nationwide opinion poll conducted in March by the respected <ORGANIZATION> Emnid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bielefeld </ORGANIZATION>. Responses by the 2,200 West Germans polled indicated widespread uncertainty about how to assess <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>, as well as some worrisome indications of latent anti-Semitism and positive views toward the dictator. An astounding 38 percent of those polled replied `` yes'' to the question: `` If not for the war and the Holocaust, would <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> have been a great German statesman?'' The poll also revealed that 46 percent of the respondents, said by the <ORGANIZATION> Emnid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> to represent accurately West German voters, consider the Third Reich to have had some positive influences. Asked to evaluate their attitude toward Jews in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, 18 percent described their views as negative and 33 percent chose zero on the scale that ranged from minus 5 for very negative attitudes to plus 5 for very positive. The complex bundle of nationalist feelings carried by many West Germans was illustrated by reaction to the statement `` I am proud to be a German,'' to which only 27 percent of the respondents fully agreed. The poll also suggested that most West Germans believe the division of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is permanent, and that more than two thirds of the respondents would like to be done with `` the past.'' Quick, a weekly picture magazine, also carried a photo essay on <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and his legacy, with similar poll results indicating strong pockets of right-wing extremism in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and substantial numbers of citizens _ 18 percent _ who believe their nation was better off under the Third Reich. Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper reported a few days earlier that two West German journalists have written the first book since the fall of the Nazi dictatorship to examine how the German press aided <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s rise to power and his march through <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Other prominent newspapers carried recent articles by historians and jurists recounting <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s dictatorship and contrasting it with a recent rise in ultra-rightist politics. The left-leaning magazine Tempo reported Wednesday it had learned of plans by extremists to break windows at Jewish-owned businesses, send aloft a helium balloon emblazoned with the forbidden swastika and to lay a wreath at the Moenchengladbach birthplace of Nazi propaganda minister <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Goebbels </PERSON>. Tempo spokesman <PERSON> Carl-Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the magazine decided to report the details to alert possible victims, not to inform would-be agitators. Austrian police prepared to seal off access to <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s birthplace in the village of <LOCATION> Braunau </LOCATION> to prevent incidents But <PERSON> Butz </PERSON>, the West German <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said police reported only throngs of journalists at the scene as of midday Wednesday.

 Calling for `` fresh thinking'' on resolving the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> conflict, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today that he and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> agreed to work toward the structuring of a `` serious negotiating process'' to achieve an Arab-Israeli settlement. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> issued the statement after a meeting of more than an hour with <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>. The two then traveled by helicopter to <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vernon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, for a tour of the home of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> and a boat ride on the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. With <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> standing at his side, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` His Majesty committed <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> to this task and I commit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to this task.'' `` The time has come to encourage fresh thinking, to avoid sterile debate and to focus on the difficult but critical work of structuring a serious negotiating process,'' he added. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that during the meeting he reaffirmed his view that `` properly designed and mutually acceptable elections'' in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> could, as an initial step, help lead to negotiations on the final status of the territories. He added that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remains committed to bringing about a comprehensive settlement through negotiations based on <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions which establish the principle of peace for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in return for <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> withdrawal from occupied territories. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, in turn, praised the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for opening a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and said that this, coupled with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s renunciation of terrorism last December, had improved prospects for peace. He expressed hope for more flexibility on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s part. `` Peace can neither be negotiated nor achieved without <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> participation,'' <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said. Both leaders expressed support for the concept of a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations-sponsored </ORGANIZATION> conference on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> emphasizing the long-standing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> view that any such conference should facilitate direct negotiations between the parties. Earlier, while the two posed for photographers in the Oval Office, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> was asked whether the time is ripe for a breakthrough in the peace process. `` I believe it is,'' he said. `` It's never been as ripe as now.'' Before the talks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was hopeful that <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> would show interest in an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> proposal for ending the negotiating impasse through elections in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Asked whether his optimistic statements meant he was supporting the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> plan, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said, `` Not necessarily.'' Later, a senior administration official said <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> `` certainly did not rject the idea'' of Palestinian elections in the occupied territories. The official, who declined to be identified, said <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> expressed `` some concerns'' about the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> proposal but `` felt, however, reassured and encouraged about the directions'' after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> explained the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> approach. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s role in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process has diminished considerably since last summer, when <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> severed administrative and legal ties with Palestinians living in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. But a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who briefed reporters on Tuesday said <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s proximity to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> makes a Jordanian role in resolving the Palestinian issue inevitable. `` There is no way in the world that one can conceive of a peace process moving forward without the active involvement of King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>,'' said the official, insisting on anonymity. After a morning meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and a luncheon with Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> was to be guest of honor at a White House dinner tonight. Meetings with congressional leaders also were on his schedule. Two weeks ago, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> proposed during a visit here that Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> elect representatives to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on limited self-government. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has endorsed the proposal on the condition that the elections lead to negotiations on the final status of the two territories. The senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said the proposal represents an attempt to end the impasse in the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. `` We're talking about trying to get things off dead center, which is where we find the situation in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> at the present time,'' the official said. `` And we see, in the elections proposal, depending on how it is developed and fleshed out, the possibility of turning a situation from a conflict situation to one of greater political dialogue.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> has expressed support for elections only if they are preceded by the withdrawal of Israeli troops. The senior official described <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> as a `` valued friend'' of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and noted that the administration has proposed an increase in military sales to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> from $ 10 million to $ 48 million next year. Economic assistance would rise from $ 15 million to $ 35 million. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> administered the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> until 1967, when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized the territory during the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. But until last summer, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> continued to play a dominant role in the area, paying the salaries of thousands of municipal employees there and funding a sizeable aid program. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s decision to dismantle <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s ties with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> was widely interpreted as a challenge to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which has long demanded total control of the territory.

<TEXT>
 A cruise ship rammed into a boardwalk, crunching a 35-foot section and damaging a waterside restaurant. No injuries were reported in Tuesday's accident, which sent dozens of people scrambling to safety. It was the second time in two months that a ship owned by <ORGANIZATION> Europa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cruise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was involved in an accident in the same area. `` There was mass hysterics,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, who was sitting with his family at the Fisherman's Landing restaurant when they saw the ship headed for them. `` I said: Everybody, let's get out of here,' and we just dove out of the way.'' Seconds later, their corner table was crushed beneath pilings and planks. The Europa Sun pulled away from the boardwalk and docked safely within a few minutes. Europa officials said strong currents contributed to the crash, just as they said currents contributed to a March 11 accident involving the Sun's sister ship, the Europa Star. That accident damaged a commercial fishing boat. The Coast Guard found no mechanical problems with the vessel and allowed it to leave on an evening cruise a few hours later, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Brantley </PERSON> said. An investigation should take about a week, he said.

<HEAD>Third Bomb Found In Germany; Possible Link To Flight 103</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government said today that a third bomb has been found in the investigation of two alleged <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> terrorists and that the case may be linked to the bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103. The federal <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s news service said in a brief report that the latest bomb discovered in the probe was hidden in a television set in an apartment in the <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Neuss </LOCATION>. `` There is a possible connection between the bomb found -LRB- Thursday -RRB- and the crash of the jet over the Scottish city of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> on Dec. 21,'' the news report said without elaborating. No one answered the telephone at the Parliament information office tonight when the AP called for more details. The bomb was found by police in a followup search of the apartment Thursday, said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON>, spokesman for the federal prosecutor's office in <LOCATION> Karlsruhe </LOCATION>. But he said suggestions linking the Palestinian case and the Pan Am bombing that killed 270 people are `` nothing but speculation.'' The bomb discovered in the television set was seized from the same apartment where two other explosive devices disguised to look like electronics equipment were found last week, <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> said. One of those bombs, hidden in a radio, blew up Monday at the <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION> headquarters of the federal police force while two disposal experts were trying to disarm it. Officer <PERSON> Hans-Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonntag </PERSON>, 35, died of his injuries from the blast, and a 29-year-old colleague who has not yet been publicly identified remained in critical condition at a <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> hospital today. An employee of the federal police force, the Bundeskriminalamt, said there was no one available tonight to answer questions about the case. The Palestinians, alleged members of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, were arrested in October in what police called the biggest weapons bust in the nation's history British investigators probing the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> bombing over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, have said the plane was blown up in the sky by plastic explosives hidden in a radio-cassette player. A radio-bomb containing the same Czechoslovak-made plastic explosives was among the weapons seized during the October raid, and authorities confirmed that the bomb that blew up Monday also appeared to have been hidden in a radio. The <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> investigation has been handled by West German officials with extreme caution because of persistent <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> media reports saying that the bomb was planted on the aircraft in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. Asked about the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> news service report, <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> disputed its suggestion that the probe of the two suspected agents of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> has turned up indications those suspects were involved with the <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> disaster. `` I know about that being said, but that is nothing but speculation,'' he said. `` They ca n't say it's not connected, so they speculate that it is. But we have no evidence that it is connected to <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> _ only the theoretic possibility exists.'' Police arrested 14 suspects in the October raids but only two, <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassem </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalkamoni </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Fattah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghandanfar </PERSON>, remain in custody. <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> said authorities expected to file charges against the two within a few months. They are suspected of forming terrorist cells in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, illegal possession of weapons and bomb attacks on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military trains in August 1987 and April 1988, <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Some victims of a clash between Georgian protesters and Soviet troops were poisoned by an `` unknown chemical substance,'' the official government daily <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> reported today. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> quoted a commission investigating the April 9 clash, which left at least 20 pro-independence demonstrators dead in the Georgian capital of <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>. The report followed widespread allegations that poison gas was used to crush the demonstration. The Georgian health minister, <PERSON> Irakliy </PERSON> <PERSON> Menagarishvili </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> the country's leading toxicologists believed the substance used on protesters had `` an irritating and atropine-like effect.'' Atropine is a poisonous crystalline alkaloid that in large doses can induce nerve paralysis and delirium. It can cause death through combined cardiac and respiratory failure. But a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Gremitskikh </PERSON>, asked at a briefing today whether nerve gas was used, said that was impossible because it is a `` combat weapon.'' <PERSON> Izvestia </PERSON> did not specify how many of 138 patients still hospitalized Tuesday had symptoms of poisoning, nor did it say if any of the deaths were caused by chemicals. <LOCATION> Georgian </LOCATION> activists claim several people have died from the effects of poison gas. They also allege military authorities refused to identify the substance or tell doctors how to treat affected patients. The Communist Party daily Pravda quoted an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official today as saying soldiers used tear gas in the clashes. It said the official, who was not identified, made the acknowledgement on Georgian state television. `` Unfortunately, this crucial admission came several days late and was made only after the level of passions had reached the highest degree,'' Pravda said. But Pravda also quoted a military spokesman as saying troops could not have used tear gas because it is not part of their standard equipment. Six newly elected deputies to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> called today for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to develop better laws to control troops and public officials to prevent a repeat of the tragedy. The six, whose joint letter was published in the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, had just returned from a trip to <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. Under the headline, `` What has happened once should not be repeated,'' the letter called for material gathered by a commission investigating the incident to be released to the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, which meets for the first time May 25. The commission's findings could become `` the basis for laws that truly, genuinely, will be defending perestroika,'' it said, referring to President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform drives. The deputies also criticized the strict censorship that was imposed on journalists in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>. `` Why and by whom is the decision always taken that at moments of sharp confrontations, it's appropriate to turn off glasnost, just like you turn off the electricity when there's an emergency?'' the letter asked. Foreign reporters have been barred from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> since the clash. The deputies accused officials of covering up soldiers' use of gas. They also said local leaders failed to adequately warn protesters that troops were about to move in, and failed to brief soldiers on how to behave. The deputies, all elected from the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, are <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Belikov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasiliev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dmitry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lunkov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eldar </PERSON> <PERSON> Shengelaya </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON>, the editor in chief of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News.

 Striking workers and radical students fought police in at least 10 cities Wednesday and protesters in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> threw a score of firebombs into a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military base. Thousands of students hurled rocks and firebombs at police on the anniversary of a student uprising April 19, 1960, that brought down the authoritarian government of President <PERSON> Syngman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhee </PERSON>. Police responded by firing tear gas at waves of student shouting for the overthrow of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo and `` Yankee go home!'' News reports from <LOCATION> Changwon </LOCATION>, a southern industrial city, said about 10,000 workers rallied at three factories and many responded with firebombs and bricks when police stopped a march by 5,000 strikers. Confrontations between riot police and students opposed to <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s government were reported at 13 schools in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Police charged into attacking crowds and made arrests during hit-ant-run battles after nightfall. Authorities said more than 40,000 students demonstrated on the anniversary at colleges and universities around the country, but did not say how many observances became violent. Several injuries of protesters and police were seen in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Police said they had no figures on injuries and arrests. Before dawn Wednesday, protesters hurled about 20 firebombs into <ORGANIZATION> Camp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Isabell </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> storage facility in eastern <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. American military officials reported minor damage. Students attack <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities to dramatize demands for the withdrawal of the 43,000 American troops based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense pact. The government had put police on top alert to block anniversary protests. At least 20,000 riot officers were deployed in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Radical students, a small but vocal minority, are trying to make an alliance with militant workers to oust the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government, but lack broad public support because of their extreme views. Government officials have said strikes threaten to disrupt economic and political stability. Labor unrest has spread to nearly all industries in recent weeks and the government says it will use military personnel to keep vital industries running if necessary. Dozens of labor activists have been arrested since a crackdown on violent labor actions began last week. Officials accused militant unions of trying to create a general strike for higher pay. At least 59 militant unions in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> decided on Wednesday to call a joint strike Friday in protest of the crackdown on labor. Union leaders said they would seek an alliance with students. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, a former general inaugurated in February 1988, has introduced broad democratic reforms but dissidents associated his government with the authoritarian regime of <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>, another general who preceded him.

 A newspaper said today that the army commander opposed a call by Christian parliamentarians to halt weeks of fighting between Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> gunners. Battles raged through the night. However, no new casualties were reported from the exchanges between Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 20,000 Christian army units and an alliance of Syrian and Druse forces. By police count, 270 people have been killed and 975 wounded since the current round of hostilities broke out March 8. The French navy ship <PERSON> Rance </PERSON>, carrying 78 wounded in the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> fighting, arrived in <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, today. The casualties were being flown from <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for treatment. French sailors carried the wounded down a gangplank to ambulances. The patients, lying under white sheets, crossed their arms over their eyes to block the brilliant <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> sunshine. `` I was sitting at home and a shell just smashed into our house,'' said <PERSON> Hammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON>, a 22-year-old student from <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. He suffered a fractured shoulder. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> was calling world leaders in an effort to generate international pressure for a cease-fire. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> spoke Tuesday with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britian </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. He planned to speak later today with Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has encouraged <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> to make a trip to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> to negotiate a cease-fire, officials said. The French take a special interest in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> because they ruled it from the end of World War I until independence in 1943. In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, a police spokesman said an unidentified assailant fired a rocket-propelled grenade overnight at the residence of <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> parliamentary deputy <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizk </PERSON> in Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The grenade damaged <PERSON> Rizk </PERSON>'s apartment, but no casualties were reported, said the spokesman. The attack came a few hours after <PERSON> Rizk </PERSON>, a Maronite, read a statement issued by 23 <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> legislators demanding a cease-fire. It did not set a deadline for the proposed truce but said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s army would be `` responsible for implementing it in areas under its control ... and the Syrian army would be responsible for implementing it in its areas of deployment and control. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s daily paper An-Nahar, in a front-page report, said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> opposed the cease-fire. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> was quoted as saying in response to <PERSON> Rizk </PERSON>'s statement: `` The people are best represented by the people. Ask the people.'' <PERSON> An-Nahar </PERSON> said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, a 53-year-old Maronite, believes that parliamentary deputies `` do not represent the people.'' <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s unicameral 99-seat house was elected in 1972 for a four-year term. The civil war, which erupted in 1975, has prevented parliamentary elections, and only 75 of the seats are filled. Acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s dual government, welcomed the statement by the Christian parliamentarians, saying he hoped it `` would lead to further positive steps.'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, has rejected several cease-fire appeals because they did not include direct reference to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s 40,000 troops as a main party to the present conflict. <PERSON> An-Nahar </PERSON> said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> `` insists that the battle is against <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>.'' A Christian government source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> was prepared to `` accept a security committee to oversee a cease-fire only if it included a Syrian representative.'' The cease-fire call also was rejected by the Lebanese Forces alliance of right-wing Christian militias. `` One can not compare between freedom and humiliation,'' the militia said in a statement. `` Our right in regaining our freedom and sovereignty is sacred.'' The latest battles broke out shortly after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> ordered a blockade of Moslem militia-run ports.

 <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials hope a plan to offer free rent to police who agree to live in public housing projects will help fight drug activity in the units. Housing officials fear a crackdown on drug dealers in nearby <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, will drive illegal drug trade into the county. `` We saw the increased drug activity in the district and were concerned about the spillover into our public housing,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the county housing department. `` Several months ago, we felt the need to develop a program. This is an ongoing response, and if we can think of something good tomorrow, we'll add it to our list,'' she added Tuesday. She said at least one police officer has moved into one of the 900 public housing units. The housing authority began hiring off-duty officers in October to patrol the grounds of the projects, at a cost through February of $ 38,000. Housing officials have asked the county supervisors to approve $ 250,000 to hire more off-duty officers and improve security around the complexes.

 <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Daphne </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Maurier </PERSON>, who became one of the century's most popular writers by mixing romance and the supernatural in `` Rebecca'' and other novels, died today. She was 81. <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker-Munton </PERSON>, a family friend, trustee and executor, said he did not know the cause of death. `` For the last fortnight -LRB- two weeks -RRB- she'd just been in a gentle decline,'' he said. The author, who also wrote such popular classics as `` Frenchman's Creek'' and `` The Birds,'' died in her sleep at her home in the village of Par, in <LOCATION> Cornwall </LOCATION>, southwest <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Baker-Munton </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Baker-Munton </PERSON> said that at the novelist's request, her funeral would be private, with no memorial service or flowers and only close family and friends attending. He said the venue was not being disclosed. He said she would be cremated. Widowed in 1965, Mrs. <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Maurier </PERSON> for many years lived a secluded existence on the wild Cornish coast that inspired the settings for many of her works. She remained fit enough until a few weeks ago to take her dog for daily walks at the beach. Friendly and kind to her neighbors, she shunned publicity. `` She was a wonderful person with a great sense of fun. She never took herself too seriously. There was no grandeur about her famousness,'' said <PERSON> Baker-Munton </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON>, who knew her 44 years. `` I ca n't say I really like people,'' Mrs. <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Maurier </PERSON> once remarked. `` Perhaps that's why I always preferred to create my own instead of mixing with real ones.'' She spent the better part of her life producing bestsellers in <LOCATION> Menabilly </LOCATION>, the mansion on the Cornish coast where the family lived. Many of her novels were filmed, including `` The Birds,'' directed by <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON>. But she herself waited until the age of 64 before consenting to face a television interviewer. Born in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on May 13, 1907, <PERSON> Daphne </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Maurier </PERSON> was one of three daughters of the renowned actor Sir <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Maurier </PERSON>. She was educated by private tutors in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and at age 21 published her first articles and short stories. Her publisher told her: `` Write a novel,'' so she produced `` The Loving Spirit'' in 1931. The novel captivated a young British army major and led to a storybook courtship. The officer, <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>, resolved to meet the author and journeyed to Par to find her. They met in 1932, married a few months later, and in the same year she published her second novel, `` I'll Never Be Young Again.'' She was just 25. `` It was rather woman's magazine-y,'' she remarked afterward. `` <ORGANIZATION> Jamaica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inn </ORGANIZATION>,'' another hit, followed in 1936, and then came `` <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON>,'' her most famous work. Published in 1938, it became an instant hit, was turned into a film by <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON> starring <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON>, and was reprinted 39 times, selling more than 1 million copies in hard cover alone. The story is about a young woman who marries an enigmatic widower and moves to his large country house, where she discovers that mystery surrounds his first wife's death. Trying to solve the mystery against the wishes of a sinister housekeeper, she is drawn into a terrifying psychological labyrinth. Histories, biographies, two plays and more novels followed, and altogether six of her novels were filmed. <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> became commander of British Airborne Forces in World War II and then treasurer to Prince <PERSON> Philip </PERSON>, husband of Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>, as she became known when her husband was made a lord, wrote much of her work at <LOCATION> Menabilly </LOCATION>, the ancient Georgian manor the couple rented. Menabilly inspired <LOCATION> Manderley </LOCATION>, the name of the mansion in `` <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Cromwell </PERSON>'s troops gutted the house during the English Civil War, and legend had it that a cavalier was bricked up alive in one of Menabilly's gray stone buttresses. Her favorite hideaway was a gardener's hut, where, she said, `` I'd sit for hours on end, chain-smoking, chewing mints and tapping away at my typewriter.'' Angular, sharp-eyed, usually wearing slacks and sweaters, she would prowl the grounds of Menabilly or answer stacks of fan mail. After her husband died in 1965, she lived alone at Menabilly except for two <ORGANIZATION> Yorkshire </ORGANIZATION> terriers. Her son and two daughters visited frequently. In 1969 the queen made her a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, entitling her to call herself <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Daphne </PERSON>. That year she had to leave Menabilly when its owner returned, and she rented <PERSON> Kilmarth </PERSON>, her home in Par. There she wrote `` The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on the Strand.'' Menabilly still stands and is inhabited. In 1971 she published `` Not After Midnight,'' a collection of five novellas containing her special mix of romance and the eerie. In 1981 she published an autobiography, `` Growing Pains.''

<HEAD>Seven Detainees Freed in South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Seven prominent anti-apartheid leaders detained for almost three years without charge were released today from a prison in the southern city of <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION>. Some of them were taken into custody at the beginning of the current state of emergency in June 1986, and the rest were detained later that year. All had joined hunger strikes by detainees earlier this year. Among those released today were the Rev. <PERSON> Sipho </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogola </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Interdenominational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lulu </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, former president of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Students; and <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Neer </PERSON>, an official with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions. All seven have held top positions in anti-apartheid groups around <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION>, one of the most militant black areas in the country. However, the highest-ranking opposition leaders in the area remain in detention. Since detainees began a hunger strike in January, the government says it has freed more than 800 people detained without charge and that less than 100 remain imprisoned. The government said previously that all emergency detainees had given up their hunger strikes. There was no way to independently confirm that report. More than 400 of the released detainees have been placed under restriction orders limiting their activities, according to human rights groups. An estimated 30,000 people, almost all black, have been held without charge for varying lengths of time under the state of emergency. The anti-apartheid activists are fighting a system that establishes a racially segregated society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The country's 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration should create a special agency to steer high-priority energy projects, such as power plant or pipeline construction, around legal and regulatory obstacles, an energy organization said Wednesday. In a broad assessment of American energy prospects, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said the special agency could enhance the nation's energy security by eliminating what it called unnecessarily long lead times for major projects. It said the agency could be fashioned along the lines of the energy mobilization board proposed by then-President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> as part of a 1979 energy program. The board was never created. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, first vice chairman of the energy association, said in presenting the proposal to the group's annual meeting that a mobilization board would enable project developers to sidestep unnecessary legal and regulatory obstacles. `` What it means is that no one can kill you with regulatory delays,'' he said. `` It goes up or down on its merits. The lawyers may not like it, but it's something we've got to do.'' <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>'s group is comprised of about 100 private and public energy-related organizations whose members represent virtually every segment of the energy industry. Among the group's other recommendations: _ Develop an integrated national energy strategy _ Increase energy conservation, encourage greater energy efficiency and expand the use of renewable energy sources _ Increase domestic oil and natural gas production and increase the use of natural gas and coal as a means of reducing the nation's reliance on foreign _ Encourage the construction of nuclear power plants <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy secretary, said in a speech to the association that the department was moving to fashion a comprehensive energy strategy but that it might not be ready by the target date of April 1990.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> condemned the assassination of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s attorney general on Wednesday as a `` brutal, despicable killing'' and charged that the act was designed to provoke further violence. `` We condemn this terrorism,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>.

 The major defendant in a money-laundering case that includes the Yugoslav consul general in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> branch of a major <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> bank faces up to 75 years in prison and a $ 7.25 million fine. <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, 44, of <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, pleaded guilty Tuesday to charges of conspiracy to defraud the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, failure to fie currency reports and violating arms export regulations. Cole, a self-described financial consultant, also pleaded guilty to attempting to launder $ 2 million in cash he was waiting to pick up at <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> when he was arrested Dec. 1. The government, in return for <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>'s agreement to cooperate with the investigation and testify, dropped charges of money laundering and interstate travel in aid of racketeering. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> DuBois </PERSON> did not set a date for sentencing. Also charged in the case are: <PERSON> Bahrudin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bijedic </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> consul general in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Vjekoslov </PERSON> <PERSON> Spanjol </PERSON>, a naturalized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen from <LOCATION> Plano </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; Vinko Mir of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, chairman of the board of <ORGANIZATION> LBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> branch of a major <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> bank; and the bank itself.

<HEAD>Ladies' Night Promotions Are Discriminatory, Iowa High Court Rules</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Ladies' nights, which offer women reduced prices to attract business, violate laws against sex discrimination, the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. Although the ruling was based on a promotion at a greyhound racing track, legal experts said the ruling could have major implications for restaurants, theaters and other businesses that offer discounts to members of one sex. The high court ordered the reinstatement of a lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Bluffs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Run </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bluffs </ORGANIZATION> dog racing track. `` By giving women free admission and discounted prices on concessions, Bluffs Run discriminated against men in the furnishing of its facilities and services,'' the court said in its unanimous opinion. The <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, operator of <ORGANIZATION> Bluffs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Run </ORGANIZATION>, offered a `` Ladies' Day'' promotion every Wednesday from June to September 1987. Women received free admission into the grandstand and got discounted prices on food, drinks and souvenirs. A track customer, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON>, sued the track after he was refused the same discounts. He sought an injunction forcing the track to halt Ladies Night promotions, but it resisted. Track officials argued that the promotions were simply to attract business. They said <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON> was n't denied services but simply required to pay the normal price. The high court dismissed that reasoning, saying lawmakers were clearly trying to ban unfair discrimination and courts should interpret that broadly. It conceded that the intent of the promotions was n't to discriminate. `` We can conceive of no way to differentiate between an accidentally discriminatory promotional scheme and a prohibited discriminatory practice without eviscerating the statute,'' the court said. The <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> high court said other states have addressed the issue. Such promotions have been banned in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and allowed in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, it noted. A spokeswoman at the Council Bluffs track said Wednesday no one was available to comment on the decision. Women's rights activists praised the decision. `` If we want to be equal, we've got to pay our way,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> Minnette </PERSON> <PERSON> Doderer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Pope </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Drake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law professor, said the ruling could be applied to `` theaters, restaurants, all kinds of places.''

 <PERSON> Abbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>'s brother, insisting the 1960s radical's death was an accident rather than suicide, headed a peace march and memorial service today in the family's native city. Folk singer <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Seeger </PERSON> helped lead the festive noon march by at least 250 people holding white dove placards and singing `` Down by the Riverside.'' The march spanned four blocks from the <ORGANIZATION> Hoffmans </ORGANIZATION>' childhood home to the service at <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emanuel </ORGANIZATION>, which the activist attended as a child On arrival at the synagogue, the marchers were met by nearly 1,000 people who filled the building, with the overflow listening outside via loudspeakers. <PERSON> Seeger </PERSON> opened the service with a reprise of `` Down by the <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION>,'' changing the first line to `` Abbie's spirit is living still.'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, 49, wore what he called his brother's most prized possession, a green <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Celtics </ORGANIZATION> jacket, and among the marchers was <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>'s close friend, basketball star <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>. A coroner said Wednesday that <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, 52, died from a combination of drugs and alcohol. He was found dead at his home near <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hope </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, on April 12. `` I just think he took a little too many -LRB- pills -RRB- and he took a good slug of booze,'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said after hearing the coroner's ruling `` My brother had a very strong love and affection for me and he would n't have left me alone like this.'' Friends began gathering on the front porch of the <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> home this morning, including <PERSON> Eron </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>, a Yippie who made a name for himself by throwing pies in faces of public officials, and <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Severan </PERSON>, a Republican political consultant who had come from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Abbie </PERSON> was my hero.'' said <PERSON> Severan </PERSON>, in a gray suit and overcoat. `` He was the first and best media consultant I ever knew.'' A balding <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, also wearing a gray suit, said before the march, `` I feel very sad of course. But <PERSON> Abbie </PERSON>'s spirit lives on. <PERSON> Abbie </PERSON> was an unbelievable person.'' `` I think <PERSON> Abbie </PERSON>'s beliefs will prevail,'' said <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, who like <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> was one of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Seven defendants. `` What <PERSON> Abbie </PERSON> believed in the'80s was empowerment. Too bad he wo n't be around to see it.'' `` <PERSON> Abbie </PERSON> was a man who had guts,'' said <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>, attired in tie-dyed T-shirt, with a Yippie pin stuck in his hat, knit of rainbow-colored wool. `` He was a true patriot.'' <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> also said he found it hard to accept a coroner's ruling that <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> died of an overdose of barbituates mixed with alcohol. `` It's the same line they gave for <PERSON> Jimi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON> and <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> <PERSON> Joplin </PERSON>,'' he said. Coroner <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosko </PERSON> said the autopsy uncovered the residue of about 150 pills, several times the lethal dose even without the presence of alcohol. In addition, <PERSON> Rosko </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>'s blood alcohol level was .20, twice the legal limit in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. `` I think it is likely that he literally fell asleep and died in his sleep. Other than that, what occurred in his last hours is strictly speculation,'' the coroner said. Phenobarbital is a long-acting sedative and an anticonvulsant. But <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> denied his brother was suicidal, despite having earlier admitted that founder of the <PERSON> Yippie </PERSON> movement had been showing signs of disenchantment in recent months. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> was a manic-depressive who often washed down medication with whiskey, his brother said. `` <PERSON> Abbie </PERSON>, as many of you know, was somewhat careless with pills and we always warned him about this kind of thing,'' he said. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said the family has received hundreds of letters, telegrams and condolence calls from friends, entertainers and even foreign embassies, but declined to identify individuals. <PERSON> Abbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> rose to prominence with the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION>, a group of radicals tried on charges of conspiring to disrupt the 1968 Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. He went underground in 1974 to avoid trial on cocaine possession charges and emerged nearly seven years later, saying he had lived in upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and undergone plastic surgery.

 World chess champion <PERSON> Garri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> won his adjourned 16th round game Wednesday in the Chess World Cup and closed to a half-point of the leader, <PERSON> Ljubomir </PERSON> <PERSON> Ljubojevic </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, with one round left. In the endgame, <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>, playing black, outmaneuvered Spanish grandmaster <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Illescas </PERSON>. Facing an unstoppable checkmate, <PERSON> Illescas </PERSON> resigned. With the 17th and final round scheduled for Thursday, <PERSON> Ljubojevic </PERSON> has 10 -LCB- points out of a possible 15 and may become the first player in 7 -LCB- years to score more points than <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> in a competition. <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>, 26, is in second place with 10 points. Another Soviet grandmaster, <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Salov </PERSON>, is third with 9 -LCB- points. `` Before the tournament the big question was whether <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> would put in a wonderful performance and push his rating above <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> to become the highest ranked player in history,'' said <PERSON> Leontxo </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> chess commentator. `` Now the question is whether <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> will be able to catch <PERSON> Ljubojevic </PERSON>.'' In the final round, <PERSON> Ljubojevic </PERSON>, 38, will play with the disadvantageous black pieces against British grandmaster <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Short </PERSON>, the third-ranked player in the world, while <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> will face off with white against former world champion <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Spassky </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> is likely to face difficulties in facing <PERSON> Spassky </PERSON>, who has the reputation of one of the hardest players to defeat. A win scores one point and a draw a half point. The World Cup, a series of six tournaments held over two years featuring a prize fund of $ 1.2 million, is regarded as the second most important event in chess after the individual world championship. Each of 25 eligible grandmasters plays in four of the six competitions. The <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION> event is fourth in the cycle. <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> won the second and thrid events in <LOCATION> Belfort </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, and is leading the competition.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> agreed Wednesday to strive for `` a serious negotiating process'' for <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said the monarch did not reject an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> proposal for Palestinian elections in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. After the two leaders talked for more than an hour at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the administration expressed satisfaction over <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s statment to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that `` I fully support you and all your efforts. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s visit marked the end of the first round of <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> diplomacy for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, following talks earlier this month with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> As he had done with the two others, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> played tour guide for the king. He took <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> by helicopter to <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vernon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, to visit the home of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> overlooking the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. They returned to the capital on a yacht confiscated from drug merchants and now owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. Standing alongside <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> in a Rose Garden ceremony, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` The time has come to encourage fresh thinking, to avoid sterile debate and to focus on the difficult but critical work of structuring a serious negotiating process. `` His majesty committed <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> to this task and I commit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to this task,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The administration said the next step was to develop <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s proposal for the 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied territories to elect representatives to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on limited self-government The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has endorsed the proposal on the condition that the elections lead to negotiations on the final status of the territories. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants a timetable from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> by July for the elections. But he said that `` serious difficulties'' remain over what kind of elections would be held and which Palestinians would agree to take part. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said it should not matter to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> whether candidates are card-carrying members of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has ruled out negotiating with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which he holds responsibile for the violence that has wracked the occupied territories. `` It should n't matter what the labels are,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> foreign operations subcommittee, as long as the participants are willing to negotiate a peaceful end to the conflict with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In his public remarks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that `` properly designed and mutually acceptable elections could, as an initial step, contribute to a political process leading to negotiations on the final status of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also reiterated his guarded support for an international peace conference as a step toward direct negotiations. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> did not publicly mention the Israeli election proposal, but a senior administration official said, `` He certainly did not reject the idea.'' The official, who declined to be named, said <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> expressed `` some concerns'' about the elections. The official said, however, that the king felt `` reassured and encouraged about the directions after having heard the president and secretary -LRB- of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> -RRB- explain our approach.'' The official said <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said he would `` try to work with others in order to ensure that ideas which could advance the prospects for peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> were not dismissed prematurely.'' The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> said any elections must be preceded by the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the territories. In his remarks, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> praised the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for beginning a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> late last year. `` I hope this will prompt <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to respond similarly to the requirements of peace and recognize the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. `` Peace can neither be negotiated nor achieved without <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> participation,'' <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said. The king's involvement in the peace process has diminished considerably since last summer, when he severed administrative and legal ties with Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> would have to be an integral part of future peace talks because of his country's geographic, historic and demographic links with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continues to believe that `` the most realistic'' solution for the future of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> have each governed at different times over the last 40 years, `` is some sort of association with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which opposes Israeli sovereignty over the land but also rejects establishment of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state there, proposed in 1982 that the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> become a Jordanian-Palestinian confederation.

 Soldiers shot and wounded 23 Palestinians in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> on Wednesday, and 11 of the victims were children, most of whom were hit in the head, hospital officials said. Soldiers and police increased security in the occupied territories and in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to prevent riots or attacks during the seven-day Jewish Passover holiday that started at sundown Wednesday. Violence erupted in four locations in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> _ the <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> and Nusseirat refugee camps, the village of <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hanoun </LOCATION>, and a neighborhood in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Arab doctors said the wounded included six children aged 14 or younger who were struck with rubber-coated metal bullets in the head and face. Five other youths were struck with plastic or rubber bullets in other parts of the body, they said. The doctors said 12 people between the ages of 15 and 30 also were injured with plastic bullets. Those wounded with rubber bullets were treated and released, the doctors said. A Western relief official in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said about 40 percent of the wounded in the Palestinian revolt are now 15 and younger. `` In the beginning of the uprising, the average age of those getting shot was much higher,'' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Since the start of the revolt in December 1987, 439 Palestinians have been killed, most shot by soldiers during stone-throwing protests. Eighteen Israelis have died. In Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, police detained 27 Arabs accused of involvement in stone-throwing riots in which three policemen and two Arabs were injured, <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandori </PERSON> said. A public opinion survey published Wednesday in the daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> said 65 percent of Israelis support a peace plan by Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> that calls for Palestinians to elect representatives to negotiate autonomy in the occupied territories. The <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hamishmar </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, however, said Jewish settlers in the occupied territories have formed a committee to try to stop the election plan, which they claim would `` bring about a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state.'' <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> said it conducted its opinion survey from April 12 to April 16, conducting face-to-face interviews with a random sample of 656 Israelis. It said 65 percent of those questioned said they supported <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s election plan, 31 percent were opposed, and 4 percent said they had no view. No margin of error was given.

 A <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> winery worker wanted in the slaying of seven people, including his wife and two of his three little daughters, was arrested in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> source said today. <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>, 28, was arrested in a rural area around <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obregon </LOCATION>, 900 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Sonora </LOCATION> state, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` He is in the custody of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> was arrested in a rural area around <PERSON> Ciudad </PERSON> <PERSON> Obregon </PERSON>, that's my understanding. We have no other details,'' the source said. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Graves </PERSON> said he had no details around the arrest and did n't know if <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> is an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizen. `` We do n't know for the moment what his citizenship is,'' he said. <PERSON> Vicente </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON>, a spokesman for the attorney general's office, said he could not confirm or deny the report. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> is a branch of the attorney general's office. `` We have no information for the time being,'' he said. <PERSON> Ciudad </PERSON> <PERSON> Obregon </PERSON> is 120 miles north of <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>'s hometown of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mochis </LOCATION>. The arrest came a day after <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> authorities reported numerous possible sightings of <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>. Services were being held in <LOCATION> Glen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ellen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, today for some of the six members of <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>'s family who were killed. About 300 people attended a memorial service Tuesday for another of the victims, <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Toovey </PERSON>. Twenty sheriff's deputies attended to keep an eye out for <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>. Authorities in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> also said <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>, a forklift operator who worked with <PERSON> Toovey </PERSON> at a winery, may have been spotted in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> sometime after the slayings began Friday morning. <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON> <PERSON> Bojorquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Armendariz </PERSON>, said her son called her on Friday and told her `` Mama, this is last time you will hear my voice.'' Ms. <PERSON> Bojorquez </PERSON> said her eldest son was sobbing in the brief phone call to her home in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mochis </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions. Ms. <PERSON> Bojorquez </PERSON> said her memory of the conversation was n't clear, but she remembered that <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> said, `` I have problems and I'm going to kill myself,'' or `` I have problems and they're going to kill me.'' He then hung up, and Ms. <PERSON> Bojorquez </PERSON> said she had not heard from him since. Sometime between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m. Friday, the fugitive's wife, mother-in-law, two sisters-in-law, and <PERSON> Toovey </PERSON>, were butchered, shot or both. On Saturday, three of <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>'s daughters were found with their throats cut, two of them dead. The surviving girl, 3-year-old <PERSON> Carmina </PERSON>, is recovering in <LOCATION> Petaluma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where she underwent a tracheotomy and is breathing through the hole in her throat to give the cut a chance to heal. She told investigators her father cut her and her sisters,. <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>'s friends said the binge began Wednesday night, a day after <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> had been served with <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, court papers ordering him to pay $ 511 a month support for a 4 -LCB- - year-old daughter from another marriage, plus nearly $ 6,000 to the county for back payments <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> has been charged with four of the killings and is sought on a federal warrant for flight to avoid prosecution. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, affidavits filed against <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> this week revealed he left a note asking God's mercy and blaming the law for the bloody rampage, apparently referring to the court order in the child-support case. In <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON>, residents said they were keeping loaded guns at the ready. Teen-agers hanging out on the corner of Shone's Grocery peer sharply at every car going by. Deputies in their patrol cars _ their dashboards plastered with enlarged photos of <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> _ do the same thing. At <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verano </LOCATION>, down the road from <LOCATION> Boyes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> lived, <PERSON> Abbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> was nervous that the suspect was still on the loose. Her children, she said, were `` freaked out ... all of us _ we're keeping our kids close. Who knows what he can do next?'' `` I hope they torture him, string him up,'' said 77-year-old <PERSON> Lela </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON>. `` I ca n't think of anything bad enough.''

<TEXT>
 Public broadcasting is a highly cost-effective way of helping solve national problems, <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> officials said Wednesday in defending a request for increased program funds and money to replace an aging satellite. Corporation president <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ledwig </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee that every dollar of federal funding to the organization now attracts nearly $ 6 in donations in corporate and audience donations. <PERSON> Ledwig </PERSON> also cited educational programs on public radio and television and the 13,000 hours a year in programming for the classroom that now reach 101 million TV viewers and more than 10 million radio listeners each week. `` Now is not the time to retreat,'' he said, when `` the public looks increasingly to public broadcasting to meet its needs for quality programming.'' He said that each federal dollar spent on an AIDS awareness program, for example, `` might save this committee thousands of dollars treating that patient.'' <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> is a private, nonprofit organization created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to support public broadcasting. It passes on about 71 percent of its operating budget to public radio and television stations. It gets its federal money two years in advance and is seeking $ 265 million for fiscal 1992. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration wants to freeze the corporation's appropriation at the 1991 level of $ 242 million and not provide any new money to replace a 10-year-old satellite that is expected to die in 1991 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has authorized $ 200 million for the satellite, but has appropriated just $ 56.8 million of that amount, in 1991. <PERSON> Ledwig </PERSON> said failure to replace the satellite would have a severe impact on programming funds that would have to be diverted to satellite construction. He also said congressional support for the full $ 265 million request `` is critical if <ORGANIZATION> CPB </ORGANIZATION> is to continue to increase the high standards of public broadcasting and to tap deeper into the potential that it holds for addressing many of this nation's most pressing problems.'' If the budget is frozen _ which means a cut, when inflation is counted _ the corporation loses the $ 6 in donations for each dollar cut, <PERSON> Ledwig </PERSON> said. Federal funds `` are the key dollars that bring in the others'' he said. Outlining something of a domino effect, <PERSON> Ledwig </PERSON> said that if the corporation's budget is cut, `` We start losing quality of the programming, we start losing audience, and we start losing contributions.'' The three subcommittee members in attendance each praised public broadcasting, but said it would be very difficult to increase spending given the current federal budget pinch. Subcommittee chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Natcher </PERSON>, D-Ky., asked how <PERSON> Ledwig </PERSON> could justify a request for a 9.5 percent spending hike <PERSON> Ledwig </PERSON> said the corporation was `` acutely aware'' of the competing demands on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for federal dollars. `` I believe, however, that federal support for public broadcasting is one of the most cost-effective means to address a number of critical problems facing the nation today.'' He said the corporation's 4.3 percent for administrative costs was the lowest of any agency in the government. Rep. <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>, said he thought public broadcasters may be trying to mimic commercial television by paying high salaries to on-air personalities and $ 15,000 appearance fees to guests. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was particularly concerned that <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rukeyser </PERSON>, host of the popular `` Wall Street Week'' program, was being paid in six figures. `` Can you justify giving sombody three times as much salary ... than we pay a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice?'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> asked. <PERSON> Ledwig </PERSON> said the show does not receive any funds from the corporation.

 Five days of factional fighting in <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION> has killed 14 blacks, including four who were ambushed by gunmen after getting off a bus, police and witnesses said Wednesday. More than 1,200 people have died during fighting between black factions since mid-1987, according to local groups. They say 165 of those victims were killed in the first three months of this year. Six people were killed Tuesday night in <LOCATION> Shongeni </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> between the southeastern cities of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pietermaritzburg </LOCATION>, the provincial capital, police said without providing details. Journalists saw three of the bodies. Two men and two women were killed Monday night in <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s Halt, a township outside <LOCATION> Pietermaritzburg </LOCATION>, police also said. Witnesses and families said those victims had just alighted from a bus when gunmen sprang from the <PERSON> bush </PERSON> and fired at them. They said several other people were wounded. Residents said a man and a 13-year-old boy were shot in the same area Monday night and two other teen-agers were shot to death in their home outside <LOCATION> Pietermaritzburg </LOCATION> on Friday. The main combatants in the fighting are the banned <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest anti-apartheid coalition, and <ORGANIZATION> Inkatha </ORGANIZATION>, the political group of Zulu leader <PERSON> Mangosuthu </PERSON> <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON>. Both groups oppose apartheid, but their tactics differ. The front favors protests, boycotts, sanctions and other confrontational methods that Inkatha does not endorse. Some anti-apartheid activists accuse <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON> of collaborating with the white-run government because he participates in the black homeland system.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> prayed for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> on Wednesday as <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, his Solidarity union made legal again by the communist government, arrived to seek economic aid for his country and thank the pontiff for his help. At his public audience, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said in a prayer for success of his homeland's new political course: `` I pray to you, Lady of <PERSON> Jasna </PERSON> <PERSON> Gora </PERSON> ... the country will have new possibilities and that transformations will take place in the social, political, economic and moral life of the entire society.'' His reference was to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s holiest shrine. Solidarity, which <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> founded in 1980 as the Soviet bloc's first independent trade union, regained official status Monday <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> had a symbolic reconciliation Tuesday with the Polish leader, Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, who declared martial law in December 1981 to crush Solidarity. At <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinci </PERSON> <PERSON> Airport </PERSON>, he told reporters: `` There is a great accord between society and the government. It is a political victory for all of us in Polish society, but for this victory to be complete we now have to take care of real issues and to get down to work together.'' The Polish government agreed in two months of negotiations with an opposition delegation led by Solidarity to legalize the union and create a freely elected <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> as a second house of the Sejm, or parliament. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> hopes the result will be financial help from the West and Solidarity's cooperation in confronting the national economic crisis. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> met with Bishop <PERSON> Fiorenzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Angelini </PERSON>, chief of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> medical mission, and thanked him for aid the office gave Solidarity medical programs. <PERSON> Angelini </PERSON> pledged another $ 30,000. Later, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> attended a crowded Mass celebrated by four Polish bishops at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marian </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Trastevere </LOCATION> church. As the faithful received communion, two people unfurled a red-and-white Solidarity banner. The Solidarity leader has said he wants to encourage Western aid for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> during his three-day visit to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, which includes meetings with politicians and labor leaders. In <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s first public comment on the legalization of Solidarity, the pontiff prayed Wednesday that all involved in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s new political course would `` continue to demonstrate the courage, wisdom and calm indispensable to serving the public good.'' Addressing the <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> of <PERSON> Jasna </PERSON> <PERSON> Gora </PERSON>, he said: `` Today I want to thank you, oh <PERSON> Mother </PERSON>, for all the good that has grown from the experiences of that period'' when Solidarity was suppressed and outlawed. `` I give to your maternal care Solidarity, which today, after the new legalization of April 17, can return to activity.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he would ask <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> on Thursday `` to give his blessing to this difficult task of reform'' and said the pope `` has always been with us.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> warmly endorsed Solidarity when he met <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> in January 1981 at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. The pontiff and the shipyard electrician met again during papal trips to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in 1983, the year <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> won the Nobel Peace Prize, and 1987. The church is a major force in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, a devoutly Roman Catholic country despite its communist government, and church representatives participated in the negotiations. In a clear illustration of Solidarity's change in status, the <LOCATION> Polish </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> met <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> at the airport.

<TEXT>
 The Christian army commander, Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, said Wednesday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was involved in `` a conspiracy of silence'' by failing to halt Syrian attacks on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Christian heartland. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> addressed about 1,200 Christians who braved intermittent rocket and artillery barrages and marched to the presidential palace in suburban <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION> to support <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s `` war of liberation'' against <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Christian parliamentarians have called for a cease-fire in the fighting with the Syrians and their Druse Moslem militia allies. But the demonstrators rejected the suggestion, highlighting a split in the Christian camp. The demonstrators burned an effigy of Syrian President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> and chanted `` Death to <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>!'' Police say 270 people have been killed and 975 wounded since the latest round of fighting flared March 8. Most victims have been civilians. Several rounds of rocket and mortar fire struck Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Wednesday, but there were no reports of casualties. Only a handful of people ventured outside, and radio stations said the relative calm was no more than a `` warriors' rest.'' `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> says the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is incapable of doing anything to help <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. This is the plot. America is not incapable, but <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is taking part in a conspiracy of silence regarding the destruction of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said. He was commenting on Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'s remarks Tuesday before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations Committee <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said: `` We make a lot of statements and sometimes it is frustrating to think that is really about all we can do. `` I do n't know what else, frankly, we can do. We have scant influence with the Syrians,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said sarcastically, `` Maybe <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has become so powerful that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is scared of it.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would support `` any efforts'' by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> to help negotiate a cease-fire. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, which has close ties to the Lebanese and ruled the country until 1943, suggested <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> travel to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> to work out a cease-fire. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief said he was not considering any such initiative as long as efforts by the 22-member Arab League continue. The latest hostilities broke out after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> ordered a blockade of militia-run ports that deprive the treasury of $ 100 million a year in tax revenue. Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> retaliated by shelling the 310-square-mile Christian enclave. The Syrians later joined the shelling. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and its surroundings have been without electricity since Sunday, when power plants ran out of fuel oil. The stations also have been severely damaged in the bombardments. Water supplies also have stopped. Bread and other vital commodities have become scarce. The shortages and shelling have forced thousands of people to flee to south and east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> or leave the country altogether. The <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> navy ship <PERSON> Rance </PERSON> carried 78 severely wounded Lebanese to <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, on Wednesday. Fifty-three of the casualties were flown to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> aboard a special French hospital plane. The others needed another day of quiet before they could be moved, doctors said.

<HEAD>Chairman of House Panel Questions Aid to Israel Because of Shootings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> foreign operations panel on Wednesday questioned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in light of incidents in which <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers have shot fleeing Palestinian demonstrators in the back. `` When is that stupid practice going to end?'' asked <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, D-Wis., who heads the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, which appropriates foreign aid money `` I do n't want to take responsibility for giving one dime to a country whose military forces are firing at people in retreat,'' <PERSON> Obey </PERSON> said angrily at a hearing on the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's 1990 aid request for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> countries. It is rare for a congressman to make such bluntly critical comments in public about <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The administration is asking to maintain the same level of aid to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> _ $ 3 billion, the most of any foreign nation. Obey said he had raised his concerns with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and all he had received were `` words.'' A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official who handles <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ties with the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, said the administration continues to urge <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to stop the practice. `` We're not satisfied,'' he said. But <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> also expressed sympathy for the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers, saying he had been in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and seen them having to deal with violent Palestinian demonstrators. `` It's difficult for them,'' he said of the soldiers More than 400 Palestinians have been killed in a violent uprising launched 17 months ago to protest <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 21-year rule of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> praised some recent Israeli measures such as the release of more than 450 Palestinian inmates, the unsealing of some houses blocked by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> forces as punitive measures, and the restoration of loudspeakers to Arab mosques. But he said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s `` record is still mixed,'' as shown by last week's shooting by security forces of at least five Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Nahalin </LOCATION>. Israeli military regulations allow soldiers to shoot plastic bullets at demonstrators fleeing the scene of a violent demonstration. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> spokesmen say plastic bullets are less lethal than other ammunition, but dozens of <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> have been killed _ some shot in the back _ because soldiers fired from closer than the required distance.

<HEAD>New Coalition Announces Plans for Huge October Demonstration</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 60 national organizations announced plans Wednesday for a huge march on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Oct. 7 to demand more federal housing assistance for the nation's homeless. `` This is n't a march so much as it is a calling forth of the human spirit,'' declared a tearful <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>, the actress and longtime homeless activist. `` It's an expression of who we are as human beings.'' She addressed a marathon news conference at which dozens of prominent civil rights, labor, church and anti-poverty leaders announced the creation of a `` Housing Now!'' umbrella organization and plans for the march in October. At least 63 nationwide organizations are participating. They include the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> YWCA </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, headed by The Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Zigas </PERSON>, a principal organizer of the march and president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Low-Income </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, predicted that `` hundreds of thousands'' of people would participate. Famed homeless activist <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> noted that `` I was 6 years old when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed legislation calling for safe and affordable housing for all Americans. Well, I'm 45 now. And it's time to remind one another that the wealthiest nation on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> has the resources, but simply lacks the will, to get the job done. <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, speaking for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION>, blamed the homeless problem on the abandonment of the federal housing assistance policies of the 1960s and 1970s. `` If we had continued those policies,'' he said, `` about 1.8 million more households would be receiving housing assistance _ or enough to accommodate 4 million people. It's no coincidence that there are 3 million homeless in this country,'' he declared. Since 1981, budget authority for all federal housing assistance programs has been cut by more than 75 percent _ from $ 32 billion to less than $ 8 billion a year, according to the new coalition. It said only about 1 out of every 4 eligible poor renters actually receives a federal housing subsidy. <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> noted also that the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> estimates than more than 24 million people spend more than half of their income on housing. `` That's a disgrace,'' he said. The joint `` call to action'' issued by the coalition complained that `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> hides behind the budget deficit when it comes to housing our people. We call on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to recognize housing as the immediate national priority it must become.'' `` We can not deny,'' said actor <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Voight </PERSON>, `` that wherever we step, we step over a human being lying helplessly in our streets. Unless we act now, our streets will be littered with them.'' `` We are sitting on our hands, and more and more people are suffering,'' said <PERSON> Louisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> for the Homeless. She cited a recent <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> study which indicated that by the year 2,000, there will be an estimated 19 million homeless Americans, barring a change in policy.

<HEAD>HHS Official Says Medicare Computer System Could Guard Against Drug
Reactions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new prescription drug benefit program being readied for 32 million Medicare beneficiaries offers a golden opportunity to include safeguards against adverse reactions that hospitalize at least 200,000 elderly people a year, witnesses told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel Wednesday. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON>, inspector general for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, told the committee that it would be `` stupid'' for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to be so insistent on enforcing an arbitrary deadline for setting up a computer-based billing system that it closes off the possibility of building in the safeguards. The idea, he said, is to program the Medicare computer system that will link the nation's pharmacies so that the pharmacist filling a doctor's prescription will be able to tell on the spot whether the patient is taking another drug that could react with the new one. Some private pharmacy chains already use such programs, often citing them in advertising as a reason to shop at a particular pharmacy. <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON> was called before the subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Aging to elaborate on a study that has found the Medicare program paid at least $ 500 million in 1987 for hospital admissions that were related to an adverse prescription drug reaction or an overdose. He told the panel that is a conservative figure because hospitals do not always flag drug reaction cases in the records they submit for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> reimbursements. Preliminary results from the report released previously found that the elderly account for 200,000, or 39 percent, of all hospitalizations from drug reactions and half of deaths from such reactions. <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON>, who has referred to the situation as `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s other drug problem,'' said he is concerned that the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is feeling so much congressional pressure to meet have a prescription drug billing system up and running well before the 1991 startup of the program that it will design a system that precludes adding computerized crosschecks of various medications a Medicare beneficiary may already be taking. `` I think that would be stupid and I would hate to see that happen,'' he said. Beginning in 1991, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> will pay 50 percent of drug costs after a $ 600 annual deductible. The government payment rises to 60 percent the following year and 80 percent in 1993 _ also after a $ 600 deduction. Suggesting that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was not entirely clear in the instructions it gave <ORGANIZATION> HCFA </ORGANIZATION> on how to set up a national system to keep track of Medicare drug claims, <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON> said, `` My concern is that we will rush ahead to create a data base driven solely by financial record-keeping concerns and neglect the quality of care issue.'' Heading off drug reactions before they occur would save money in the long run by cutting down hospitalization costs for treating the victims of such episodes, he said. Almost all adverse prescription drug reactions stem from patients not properly following directions for taking the medicine or taking different medicines that can react with each other _ either drugs they are prescribed by different physicians or by a single physician who does n't know any better. Food and Drug Administrator <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> supported <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON> in calling for a <ORGANIZATION> HCFA </ORGANIZATION> computer system that provides a way to crosscheck prescriptions. `` We think this is a golden opportunity,'' said <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. `` We fear it may be implemented without including a way to do this.''

<HEAD>City Board Has Authority To Close Down Houses, Businesses</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 City officials appointed a citizens board with the authority to close buildings or businesses where drug activity has become entrenched. City General Counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> described the power of the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuisance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> as `` pretty drastic,'' but also called it `` one of the most significant'' steps taken by the city to fight drug dealing. The five-member board can order landowners to make changes in their buildings, or the activities that go on there, to prevent drugs from being sold. It also has the power to close businesses entirely in cases where members think the owners are unable or unwilling to do anything to stop drug dealing. The board, which met for the first time Tuesday, will hear evidence presented by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counsel </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> about buildings where drug deals are known to have taken place at least three times.

<HEAD>U.S. Presses Case for Modernization of Nuclear Missiles to NATO</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials Wednesday stepped up efforts to convince <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> must improve its short-range nuclear weapons by offering intelligence information on how the Soviets are boosting their arsenal. Defense sources said, however, that it remained unclear how the 16-nation <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> would handle the politically sensitive issue. Defense Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, attending his first <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> meeting, presented what was described as an unexpectedly extensive intelligence briefing behind closed doors, stressing the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s efforts in the past five years to modernize its own arsenal of short-range nuclear missiles and artillery shells. `` Our evidence is overwhelming that this has been an on-going process and will continue to be an on-going process,'' said one senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The decision to offer the briefing was prompted by a growing split within the Western alliance, in which <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and some other <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries have expressed doubt about moving now to replace the <LOCATION> Lance </LOCATION> nuclear missiles deployed with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> forces. Those missiles are expected to become obsolete by the mid-1990s and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials say <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has no choice but to replace them and maintain some nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and a few other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members also have questioned the wisdom of proceeding now with modernization when it might be possible to open new arms control talks with the Soviets on the issue. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> counters that negotiations should be completed on reducing long-range nuclear missiles and conventional forces before <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> worries about short-range battlefield missiles. At the conclusion of the first day of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> consultations, the American defense source said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was convinced the modernization issue had been spawned by internal politics within individual countries, and not by any real split between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies. While final decisions on production and deployment schedules are not necessary right now, the source continued, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government does need some broad language of support for nuclear modernization in order to win funding from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to start missile development work. `` No specific decisions on specific weapons in specific numbers in specific locations are required now,'' said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> source. `` But it is clear that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will not support programs that they believe that the alliance is not prepared to see become a part of our deterrent. And that's a problem. So there is no doubt that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will be looking to see if there is a proper expression of support.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies agreed Wednesday that nuclear weapons can not be withdrawn from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> given the current arms balance with <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact, and thus <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> hopes to win the expression of support he wants, the source concluded. `` <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> is 40 years old this year. It has gone through many crises and we will also overcome this one,'' said Dutch Defense Minister <PERSON> Frits </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolkestein </PERSON>. The first day of discussions ran longer than expected. Officials described the talks as businesslike, with no voices raised in the closed-door meetings. Officials said the allies appeared in agreement that the defense ministers should not do anything that would be seen as upsetting in the next few weeks before a summit of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders. That gathering will be held at the end of May in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. The officials were continuing to discuss the wording of a public statement that will be released at the end of talks on Thursday. <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s defense minister, <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Coeme </PERSON>, said, `` There is still ennormous work to be done.'' At issue is how clear the statement expresses support for the modernization program. `` You do n't design a missile to European standards, based on the recommendations of the Europeans, with the understanding that they're not going to deploy it,'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> source said. However, officials of other <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> delegations have said it was unlikely that the language would go beyond that of previous statements when the allies have said their forces `` will be kept up-to-date where necessary.'' <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> has said it wanted to hold off decisions on modernizing short-range nuclear weapons until the early 1990s and agree to open East-West arms talks on the arms as soon as possible.

<HEAD>Jury Weighs Life Or Death For Shopping Center Killer</HEAD>

 A prosecutor asked jurors Wednesday to reject defense claims of temporary insanity and recommend the death penalty for a man convicted of killing six people in a shopping center shooting spree. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> left `` a killing field'' behind him in the two <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> shopping centers where he also tried to kill 24 others in 1987, State Attorney <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfinger </PERSON> told jurors. `` May God have mercy on the defendant's soul for his cruel and atrocious and uncaring acts,'' <PERSON> Wolfinger </PERSON> said in his final argument. `` Evidence has shown that this defendant has forfeited his right to live on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. `` He is a cold, calculating killer. He deserves to die.'' <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> demonstrated that he was in total control of his mental faculties when he methodically tracked down and shot at his victims repeatedly, some of them while they lay wounded and moaning, <PERSON> Wolfinger </PERSON> said. There was premeditation because `` his plan was to kill, kill, kill. He meant to do it and he did it,'' he said. Public defenders representing the 61-year-old former librarian were to present their final arguments later. The jurors who convicted <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> on April 5 of 32 counts of murder, attempted murder and kidnapping now have to recommend his punishment: death or life in prison without possibility of parole for 25 years. The verdict can be by simple majority rather than unanimously. Circuit Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Antoon </PERSON> said he would give `` great weight'' to the panel's recommendation, but he does not have to accept it in passing either sentence. The state attorney held up a shotgun used in the wounding of a teen-ager across the street from <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON>'s house. <PERSON> Wolfinger </PERSON> pumped the weapon several times in front of the jury. He then held up the semiautomatic assault rifle used in the shopping center rampage, popping in a 30-round clip several times. Anticipating defense arguments that <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> was insane at the time of the April 23, 1987, shootout, the prosecutor said: `` There has never been any disagreement over mental illness. The only disagreement is its effect'' and how much of a role it played in the crimes. The defense tried to present `` every conceivable, so-called bizarre incident'' in <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON>'s life, <PERSON> Wolfinger </PERSON> said, and it wanted the jury to feel that `` he should be relieved of all responsibility for that crime.'' As to arguments about the defendant's delusions over homosexuality, <PERSON> Wolfinger </PERSON> said: `` What we have here is a man who ca n't accept the doubts of his own masculinity ... and blamed it on everyone else.''

 Independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said Wednesday he thinks central charges dropped from the Iran-Contra case of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> are `` salvageable'' against former National Security Adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. In a court session before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies are showing greater flexibility than they did previously in regard to what classified material may be declassified for trial. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> also said some classified documents which caused the intelligence community concern in the North case are n't relevant in the <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> case. He said he was willing to make the documents available so that the defense can see for itself the `` lack of relevance.'' `` I think they are salvageable,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said of conspiracy, theft and wire fraud counts. `` There has been a softening in the position of the intelligence agencies.'' Due to national security concerns, conspiracy and theft counts against <PERSON> North </PERSON> were dismissed Jan. 13. Earlier, a charge of wire fraud against him also was dismissed. North, who worked under <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, has faced trial on 12 remaining felony charges over the past 12 weeks. His case is expected to go to the jury Thursday. North, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and businessmen <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> were indicted March 16, 1988, in the Iran-Contra affair. All were charged with conspiracy, theft of government property and wire fraud, as well as other crimes. The conspiracy and theft counts accused them of illegally diverting more than $ 14 million in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms-sale proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels. The wire fraud count accused them of carrying out the diversion through telephone calls and other communications. In court, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckler </PERSON> should submit a discovery request by May 15 for material he wants to use. <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mixter </PERSON>, an attorney in <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s office, asked that the date be moved up, a request which made <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, sitting at the defense table, shake his head in displeasure. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> agreed to give the defense until May 15. The conspiracy and theft counts in the North case foundered after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> ruled Dec. 12 that significant amounts of classified information could not be deleted from 300 documents <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> wanted to use against <PERSON> North </PERSON> at trial. Among the items the judge said would have to be disclosed in order to ensure a fair trial were verbatim texts of intelligence reports and names of Central American countries. The judge also insisted on including references to foreign officials by their general importance and function, and also references to <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> officials and sources. Faced with the refusal of intelligence agencies to declassify so much information for use at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> went into court and asked <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> to dismiss the charges.

 <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyer pleaded for acquittal today, telling jurors the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide `` does n't want to be a hero. He just wants to go home.'' In an emotional closing argument, <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said <PERSON> North </PERSON> became a `` sacrificial lamb'' in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House and was fired to spare the former president political harm. `` Now he cries out,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said as the 12-week Iran-Contra trial wound toward its conclusion a few blocks from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> where North once worked. `` In a sense he has been a hostage. I ask you on the evidence to set him free.'' In his hour-long rebuttal, prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> put down <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s closing argument with the Shakespearian line: `` It was all sound and fury, signifying nothing.'' `` You have heard a lot about courage at this trial,'' said <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>. `` There's another kind of courage: courage to admit when you are wrong; courage to admit personal responsibility, courage to admit guilt where appropriate. He -LRB- North -RRB- has not admitted any of those things; it's time for you to do it for him.'' North, a former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION>, is charged with 12 criminal counts of lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the attorney general, illegally converting travelers checks to his own use and conspiracy to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> through a tax scam to support the Contra rebels fighting the leftist Nicaraguan government. If convicted, he could receive prison terms totaling 60 years and fines of $ 3 million. Prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> was permitted time to address the jury a final time after <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> concluded. Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> is expected to give the case to the jury on Thursday. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, who has <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s defense lawyer through tumultuous congressional hearings and tedious courtoom maneuvering, seemed to grow emotional as he summed up the defense for the last time. `` Greater love has no man than he be willing to lay down his life for another,'' the lawyer read from a Bible in his hand. `` That's the kind of man <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> is,'' said <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. `` Now he cries out. In a sense he has been a hostage. I ask you on the evidence to set him free.'' `` <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> does n't want to be a hero,'' the attorney declared. `` He just wants to go home.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> described the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and the Iran-Contra affair this way: `` It's like a big octopus. The president, <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> ... they are all reaching out to get <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> to run something. ... They are all reaching out to get him.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> were national security advisers to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and the late <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> was <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director. Earlier, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said it was `` natural instinct'' for North to destroy documents because he was engaged in some of the government's most secret operations. `` It's a reasonable thing to do,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s decision to destroy records as he prepared to leave the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff in November 1986 `` The act of destroying documents'' would be the `` natural instinct of anybody running a covert operation.'' `` Colonel <PERSON> North </PERSON> had charge of running some of the most secret operations'' in the government, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said as <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s Iran-Contra trial approached its end The former <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> aide is accused of altering, destroying, concealing and removing documents as the Iran-Contra affair emerged publicly in November 1986. North testified that among the documents he destroyed were memos reflecting the diversion of funds from the sale of weapons to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. One memo reflecting a planned diversion that <PERSON> North </PERSON> neglected to shred was found in his files on Nov. 22, 1986 by an aide to then-Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. Elsewhere in his closing arguments, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said highly sensitive information distributed to <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> and national security adviser <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> in November 1985 showed that Hawk missiles were aboard a flight to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> referred to the foreign intelligence data to bolster his defense against charges that <PERSON> North </PERSON> prepared a false chronology of events that prompted <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> to mislead <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in November 1986. North is accused of preparing documents stating that no one in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government knew until January 1986 that <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION> were aboard an aircraft to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on the November 1985 flight assisted by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> proprietary airline carried the shipment. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> held up a notebook stuffed with 417 pages of 168 top-secret intercepted messages that pertained to the Hawk shipment. The intelligence data was distributed immediately to <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> hours after it was gathered, he said. Any accusation `` based on the charge that <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> was the repository of special information is wrong, false, inaccurate, misleading and unfair,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> argued. Referring to <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> as `` the master spy,'' he said: `` Is anybody to believe he did n't know what was in the intercept book?'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said the material is so sensitive that the jurors wo n't be permitted to see it He held up a brief summary of the information culled from the intercepts. When <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> testified to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 21, 1986, he gave no indication that the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff knew the November 1985 shipment contained arms. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> testified that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government did n't learn until January 1986 that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had transferred 18 Hawk missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The November 1985 Hawk shipment was of questionable legality. It was been retroactively legalized by a `` finding'' that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed in December 1985.

<HEAD>Sign Saying `Woody Guthrie Was No Hero' Torn Down in Singer's Hometown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OKEMAH, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The tearing down of a sign declaring `` <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> Was No Hero'' in the folk singer's hometown has refueled longstanding debate over how locals should remember <LOCATION> Okemah </LOCATION>'s most famous native son. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, a reporter for the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Okemah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leader </ORGANIZATION>, faces a $ 54 fine for tearing down the sign last week on the American Legion building across the street from the newspaper office. The sign was put up by funeral director <PERSON> Bart </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, a former city councilman and a member of the Legion. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> filed the municipal complaint against <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> alleging destruction of private property. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, 26, said he plans to represent himself at a May 8 hearing. The incident is the latest in a dispute that has raged for years in the town of 3,500, with <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>'s detractors saying he was a Communist and his admirers saying the man who penned `` This Land is Your Land'' ought to be honored. Tensions are expected to heighten with the scheduled appearance of <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Arlo </PERSON>, in an April 29 concert at <LOCATION> Okemah </LOCATION>'s Crystal Theater. <PERSON> Arlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> has never performed in his father's hometown. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s 2-foot-by-3-foot sign reprints a recent editorial from The Oklahoma Constitution, a conservative <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> tabloid. The newspaper, under the headline `` Woody Was No Hero,'' calls <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> a `` militant atheist.'' The sign was replaced after it was torn down, but it was gone again Wednesday. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said he does n't know who removed it this time. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheatham </PERSON>, wife of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legion </ORGANIZATION> commander <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheatham </PERSON>, said the Legion post will meet Thursday to discuss whether the sign should be displayed at the Legion hall. The sign also was posted elsewhere around town, she said, but <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said he had n't seen it anywhere else. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> would not consent to a telephone interview, a spokeswoman at his funeral home said Wednesday. Mrs. <PERSON> Cheatham </PERSON> described <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> as `` very patriotic.'' He was defeated in his bid for a second city council term earlier this month. Mrs. <PERSON> Cheatham </PERSON> said until recent years most townspeople ignored <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>, who died in 1967. A movie about his life, `` Bound For Glory,'' rekindled some interest, she said. <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>'s house was demolished years ago and remains a pile of debris on an overgrown lot a few blocks from downtown. But a town water tower visible from Interstate 40 proclaims <LOCATION> Okemah </LOCATION> as the home of <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>. <PERSON> Arlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>'s appearance coincides with the release of an album taped in December by local musicians and school children as a tribute to the Dust Bowl balladeer.

 A high school bodybuilder with a history of violent crimes was sought Wednesday for stabbing his former girlfriend, the girl's mother and a 2-year-old child. The girl's mother and the child were in critical condition Wednesday. The mother was in a coma; police said they were unable to estimate how many times she had been cut. Police said the suspect, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeazel </PERSON>, walked away last week from a group home where state authorities recently placed him. <PERSON> Yeazel </PERSON>, 18, was being sought for the stabbing Tuesday of <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, 50; <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, her 17-year-old daughter; and 2-year-old <PERSON> Rachelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Pottorf </PERSON>, who was staying at a day-care center <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> ran in her home. The attack occurred after <PERSON> Yeazel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> broke off a months-long relationship, said police in this bedroom community northwest of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> had cuts on her arms and legs, officials said. `` He -LRB- Yeazel -RRB- has an extensive history of violent crimes,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mink </PERSON>, adding that he could not disclose the charges because they were brought against a juvenile. <PERSON> Yeazel </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and was adopted by an American family in 1985, told his friends that while in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> he used cocaine `` because it was easier to get than food,'' said <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Salins </PERSON>, mother of an <ORGANIZATION> Arvada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> student. <PERSON> Mink </PERSON> said there was no evidence that <PERSON> Yeazel </PERSON> used cocaine in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He also said there was no evidence <PERSON> Yeazel </PERSON> used steroids, although several high school students told authorities he was an enthusiastic bodybuilder and they believed he used them. Friends said <PERSON> Yeazel </PERSON> gave up using cocaine because of his passion for bodybuilding, but said they believe he began using steroids, a drug used by some athletes to build muscle bulk.

 <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>'s fans from around the world flooded a hospital with cards, flowers and phone calls Wednesday after the queen of comedy emerged from emergency heart surgery in serious condition. `` Her Irish eyes are smiling,'' husband <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> said after Miss Ball awakened at 9:45 a.m. Wednesday, just 14 hours after surgeons finished the operation. She was alert and looked well, he said. Surgeons said she should recover from the seven-hour operation, during which they replaced her aorta and aortic valve with the donated organ tissue of a 27-year-old man. Miss <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, 77, who reigned for decades as the zany, rubber-mouthed queen of comedy, had her heart stopped for two hours during Tuesday's procedure, which was described as surgery with a `` substantial mortality rate.'' `` <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> spent an uneventful night, which is a very good sign. The two surgeons who worked on her continue to be optimistic that she is moving toward a recovery,'' <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON> said. `` All indications continue to be positive,'' he said. <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> said he told his wife about the hundreds of good wishes from fans and friends, but she was unable to speak because of an oxygen mask over her mouth. `` The smile in her eyes were sentences,'' the beaming <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> said. The hospital has received hundreds of telephone inquiries, `` as many calls as the switchboard can handle,'' from fans and the news media worldwide, particularly <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wise </PERSON> said. Flowers were also coming in. `` The best thing you could do to get in touch with her is to send cards to <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>,'' Wise said, noting Miss Ball would spend several days in intensive care, where flowers are banned. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kass </PERSON>, the surgeon who performed the operation, said Miss Ball suffered a tear in her aorta, the main artery in the body. `` The fact that she came through this leaves me optimistic,'' <PERSON> Kass </PERSON> said. `` The major risk is in the operating room, at least initially.'' Miss Ball, who had been in ill health in recent years, suffered a mild heart attack about a year ago. The redhaired entertainer and her late former husband, <PERSON> Desi </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnaz </PERSON>, starred in `` I Love <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>,'' one of the most popular TV shows of all time, from 1951 to 1957. The show is still seen around the world in syndicated reruns. Miss <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> was last seen in public introducing the Young Hollywood production number with <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> at the 61st Academy Awards on March 29. The two comics received a standing ovation. Wearing a fashionably slit skirt, Miss Ball appeared to be in good health and giggled freely throughout a brief routine with Hope. `` There's only one <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>. You do n't meet many people like her,'' <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> said. `` Like the rest of the world, <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> -LRB- Hope's wife -RRB- and I are praying everything will be all right.'' Miss Ball went solo in 1962 with `` The Lucy Show.'' The name was changed to `` Here's Lucy'' in 1968. The show went off the air in 1974. The Arnazes had two children, <PERSON> Lucie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Desi </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. Miss Ball married nightclub comedian <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> in 1961 He became her executive producer.

<HEAD>Government To Prosecute Labor Leaders Who Called General Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The military government on Wednesday said it is prosecuting the labor leaders who called a general strike that prompted bombings, demonstrations, and hundreds of arrests. Organizers called Tuesday's strike, which the government labeled `` a total failure,'' to demand the return of two other labor leaders banished to provincial towns for helping to organize a similar protest in 1987. Interior Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON> said Wednesday the government is asking a <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> court to try the labor leaders because `` we can not allow this kind of actions.'' Named in the government's legal action were the acting president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivares </PERSON>; and four other leaders, <PERSON> Nicanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Araya </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON>, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimeenez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Moises </PERSON> <PERSON> Labrana </PERSON>. The labor federation called the general strike. It failed to attract major support from workers but prompted daylong demonstrations in downtown <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> and widespread violence in its slums. Police on Wednesday corrected an official report, saying one suspected guerrilla _ not two _ were killed Tuesday night in a clash with security agents. Police said the second man is at a local hospital in critical condition. The secret police said the clash occurred when agents caught the men as they planted a bomb to blow up an electric power pylon in a working-class district on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>. Police spokesman <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ormenno </PERSON> said 412 people were arrested around the country in the demonstrations. Most of them were to be released, but 157 remained jailed Wednesday. Officials said 12 were charged with breaking anti-terrorist law and will be tried. Some <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> neighborhoods remained without power Wednesday because of the bombing of at least 13 electric towers the day before. Police said more than 50 bombs went off in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> alone, leaving two men injured and damaging banks, government buildings, a telephone company office and other facilities. <PERSON> Olivares </PERSON> said his labor movement was not responsible for the violence, which he said had `` dubious origin.'' Leftist groups opposed to the military government of President Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> have bombed power facilities in the past. The labor leader said he and his colleagues `` will face with responsibility any actions by the government against our organization.'' The sentence they face will depend on the charges a prosecutor files within the next few days. They could face banishment like their two colleagues.

<HEAD>Federal Prison Tightens Security After Copter Escape Attempt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A web of overhead cables covered some open areas of a federal prison Wednesday as the warden sought to tighten security in the wake of a failed escape attempt by helicopter. Warden <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> ordered the cables strung over the high-security exercise courtyard at the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> where drug smuggler <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> `` Barry'' <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> hopped on a hovering helicopter Monday. The aircraft snagged a 14-foot security fence around the courtyard and crashed. <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> was in satisfactory condition Wednesday at <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and the pilot, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, was in good condition. Both suffered broken legs. They have been charged with escape-related counts. In the next few months, the entire 48-acre complex which holds about 1,000 prisoners southwest of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> will have cables strung between the roofs of buildings and utility poles. `` If a helicopter tries to land, it will be tangled in the cable,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. Money to secure the prison against aerial escapes had been requested from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> before <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>'s attempted breakout, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. `` It's an expensive proposition, but after this, I think we'll get the money for it,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said the crash that foiled the escape was caused by the novice pilot's miscalculation in trying to fly out of the 50-foot by 200-foot exercise yard. Two inmates jumped over the fence to help pull <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> from the rubble, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. `` At first, we thought they may have been involved in the escape attempt and -LRB- they -RRB- were placed in lock-up,'' he said. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> would not have gotten far if the 37-year-old helicopter had not crashed because <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs and police planes would have been sent after them immediately, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Marshal's Office was trying to determine how <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Hallandale </LOCATION>, a champion offshore powerboat racer convicted of drug smuggling, got in touch with <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, a diver in <LOCATION> Gold </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> was just learning to fly a helicopter and had less than 40 hours flying experience on an airplane

 <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyer, in an emotional final argument Wednesday, portrayed the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide as a sacrificial lamb, a scapegoat and a hostage, and implored jurors in his trial to `` set him free.'' `` <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> never wanted to be a hero,'' said <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. `` He just wants to go home.'' But prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>, having the last word, asked the jury to `` return a verdict of guilty in each and every one of the 12 charges.'' With that, the nine women and three men who will decide North's fate were sent home They will return Thursday to begin their deliberations after instructions from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>. During deliberation, the jury will be sequestered for the first time since the Iran-Contra trial began. In his hour-long rebuttal, <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> said it had been an `` unhappy, unpleasant, miserable criminal trial,'' and dismissed <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s closing argument with a Shakesperian touch: `` It was all sound and fury, signifying nothing. `` You have heard a lot about courage at this trial,'' <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> said. `` There's another kind of courage: courage, to admit when you are wrong, corage to admit personal responsibility, courage to admit guilt where appropriate. He -LRB- North -RRB- has not admitted any of those things; it's time for you to do it for him.'' It was the end of two tough days for <PERSON> North </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel whose power while he was at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> was substantial. His face paled and he busied himself with writing while <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> denounced him; he looked at the jury while <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> pleaded for him. `` The government has not shown criminal behavior,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. `` The man who held the lives of others in his hands, now puts his life into yours.'' The reference was to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s protecting names of people he dealt with by shredding or altering documents, which <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> saw as `` a reasonable thing to do.'' <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> had another explanation: `` He was destroying documents deliberately so they would n't find what he did n't want them to find.'' After the arguments, <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s mood brightened and he joined his wife, who was speaking with a minister in the front row of spectators. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, choked with emotion throughout much of his three-hour closing argument, mentioned President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s telephone call on the day <PERSON> North </PERSON> was fired, a call in which the president called North `` a national hero,'' and also a postcard North got from then-Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> thanking him for his work. `` All these people who went to <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> for help, where are they now?'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> asked. Summing up <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s defense in the trial's 12th week, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said he had done his job well as a White House aide, following superiors' orders to help the Nicaraguan rebels, then was thrown overboard as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sought to escape political heat over the affair. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> told the jury that <PERSON> North </PERSON>, who had worked to free American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, has been, in a sense, a hostage himself. `` I ask you, on the evidence, to set him free,'' said <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. In the spectator section, behind <PERSON> North </PERSON> at the defense table, were his wife and three of his four children. <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> had been at the trial before, but it was a first for the children. During a recess, <PERSON> North </PERSON> took their youngest daughter by the hand and walked with her down the courtroom corridor. North is charged with 12 criminal counts, including lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the attorney general, illegally converting traveler's checks to his own use and conspiring to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> through a tax scam to support the rebels fighting the Nicaraguan government If convicted, he could receive prison terms totaling 60 years and fines of $ 3 million. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> sought to persuade the jurors that the government had presented only weak evidence to back up the charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON>, whom he described as caught `` between a rock and a hard place'' in trying to keep state secrets while he was asked by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to tell all. `` He was fired from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, offered as a sacrificial lamb so to speak to the raging <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said, referring to the day North was fired in November 1986. Leaning forward and almost whispering to the jury, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> asked, `` What do you think was happening? I draw the conclusion the president was using <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> as a scapegoat and threw him overboard to escape some political heat.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said <PERSON> North </PERSON> was innocent of the charges that he lied about raising funds for the Contras, saying there was no evidence that <PERSON> North </PERSON> ever raised the subject with a contributor or that money was given in his presence. He said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had met with contributors, including one who soon after donated $ 1 million worth of stock. `` What is the difference between what the president did and <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> did?'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> asked. `` The president is happily retired in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> has been in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> 2 -LCB- years fighting for his reputation.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> had used a biblical quotation in his final argument Tuesday, and said he had one of his own. `` Greater love has no man than he be willing to lay down his life for another,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. `` That's the kind of man <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> is,'' he said. `` Now he cries out. In a sense he's been a hostage. I ask you, on the evidence, to set him free.'' The Iran-Contra affair was `` like a big octopus,'' said <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. `` The president, <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> ... they are all reaching out to get <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> to run something. ... They are all reaching out to get him.'' He referred to former National Security Advisers <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and the late <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Soviet Says Moscow Will Open Airways to Foreign TV</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> promised a 35-nation East-West conference on press freedom Wednesday that it would review working conditions for Moscow-based journalists and open its airways to foreign TV programs. The chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegate accused four of the communist participants _ <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> _ of ignoring the agreement on press and other freedoms that the 35 countries signed in January at the Conference on Security and Cooperation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The signatory countries varied from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where press freedom is enshrined in the constitution, to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, where typewriters have to be licensed and police keep records of the typefaces. The aim of this week's meeting, Information Forum, is to monitor compliance with the agreement. Ambassador <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marks </PERSON>, a former director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and head of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> delegation, said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had made substantial progress, including stopping jamming foreign broadcasts, but its media remained only `` semi-free.'' `` The concept that the East Europeans and the Soviets had that the government controls the press is now disappearing ... some -LRB- non-official -RRB- viewpoints are presented, not all,'' <PERSON> Marks </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` But we're going to be behind them. The objectives are to have a free press, not a semi-free press.'' Soviet deputy foreign minister <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON>, questioned by reporters at a news conference on why foreign correspondents were banned from the Soviet republic of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> during nationalist unrest this month, said, `` We will take this -LRB- criticism -RRB- very seriously.'' `` We will work very hard to provide international standards for the working of journalists,'' said <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON>. He said foreign reporters were banned from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, where 20 people were killed in disturbances, `` because it could be dangerous for the correpondents.'' In an address to the conference Wednesday, <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> said foreign correspondents can now travel more freely in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and were allowed more contact with Soviet citizens. `` Glasnost means that every citizen should have the right to receive complete and reliable information on any public issue,'' said <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON>. `` There are no limits to improving reporters' working conditions. He added that `` extensive work is under way in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to create optimal conditions to ensure free access to information ... including arranging subscriptions to foreign periodicals and reception of foreign TV broadcasts.'' He acknowledged difficulties remained about receiving foreign TV signals in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, using copying equipment, access to audio and video information and buying foreign periodicals. `` The existing obstacles and restrictions in this area will be removed as the overall democratization process in the U.S.S.R. further unfolds.'' Marks said the four East bloc states he singled out have recognized the obligations of January's <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> agreement, `` but they have not fulfilled them.'' He said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation will press specific cases during closed sessions, which start next week after four days of opening speeches by delegation chiefs. `` Our objective is not to be confrontational,'' said Marks. `` We want to try to solve problems ... we do n't need any more -LRB- agreements on -RRB- principles, we need action.'' The <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> agreement was the outcome of East-West talks on human rights and free speech that began in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> in the 1970s.

 A Taiwanese boat suspected of illegal salmon fishing off the <LOCATION> Aleutian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> steamed toward home Wednesday, trailed by a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter seeking permission from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> to board the vessel. `` It's going its way, and we're following,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>. Because the boat, the Cyi Yang No. 1, is in international waters, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> ca n't board it without permission, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. The incident began Sunday when the crew of the <PERSON> Cyi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> warned the <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter on patrol five miles away, that driftnets were in the water and that it should stay away, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON>, an aide to Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>. Upon learning that it had communicated with a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> vessel, the squid boat abandoned its nets and headed southwest, toward <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON> said. The <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> pursued the boat, which did not respond to demands that it stop. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said the encounter took place about 450 miles from legal fishing waters, about 400 miles southwest of the far end of the Aleutian chain. By midday Wednesday, the vessels were 1,100 miles southwest of <PERSON> Adak </PERSON>, he said. <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON> said Wednesday that a Taiwanese government official had called the senator to apologize for the incident and to say that <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> will allow the vessel to be boarded. The official told <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON> the Taiwanese government is attempting to contact the ship's owner to order it to stop, <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said that information had not been relayed to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> by midmorning.

 Gov. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON> signed legislation on Wednesday appropriating $ 5 million for cold fusion research and creating a nine-member committee to oversee the work and its potential practical application. <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON> charged the panel, comprised of members representing industry, law, education and the state, to `` make a hard-nosed evaluation of this process, to make sure the money, when it's spent, is spent wisely and prudently. At the same time, the governor asked committee members to use their resources to protect <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s investment in the research. The committee was formed following the March 23 news conference in which <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> researcher <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and his British colleague, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON>, announced they had sustained a room temperature fusion reaction. A special session of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> appropriated the $ 5 million for further research and development. <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hixson </PERSON>, chief executive of the <ORGANIZATION> Bonneville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said the committee would meet Wednesday to set an agenda. `` Our task is to try to move -LRB- cold fusion -RRB- from basic research to practical application,'' he said. `` But first, we need to get as broad an understanding of this process as we can.'' It was too soon to say when funds would begin to be released, or where, <PERSON> Hixson </PERSON> said. He said the committee hoped to meet with <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> to discuss their research, and eventually with scientists from other institutions conducting similar work. <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON> said he had recently returned from a tour of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, where he found a great interest and enthusiasm for the fusion research.

 <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> officials and survivors of a stadium crush that killed 95 soccer fans denied police reports Wednesday that hooliganism and drunkenness were factors in the disaster. Police in the northern city of <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION> said more than a dozen supporters of <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION>'s soccer team were arrested before Saturday's game for public order offenses. <PERSON> Irvine </PERSON> <PERSON> Patnick </PERSON>, the governing <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s lawmaker in <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION>, said police told him `` they were hampered, harassed, punched, kicked and urinated on by <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> fans'' as they struggled to help the injured and dying. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Heffer </PERSON>, an opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member from <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION>, called <PERSON> Patnick </PERSON>'s charges `` absolutely degrading and disgusting.'' `` Mr. <PERSON> Patnick </PERSON> is suggesting that <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> people did the most despicable things to their own people, when the whole of the television -LRB- coverage -RRB- showed to the contrary,'' <PERSON> Heffer </PERSON> said in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>, his voice trembling. <PERSON> Patnick </PERSON> was not in the house. Police have come under attack in the aftermath of the disaster for unlocking a gate and allowing several thousand fans to pour into an already crowded standing-room section at <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> stadium in <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION>. The victims were trampled or crushed to death against an anti-riot fence. Nineteen remained hospitalized Wednesday, nine in intensive care. Most of the victims were fans of the <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> team, which was playing a team from <LOCATION> Nottingham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Middup </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yorkshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, the local police union chapter, told BBC-TV: `` We are quite convinced that a lot of the fans _ many, many hundreds of them outside that gate _ had been drinking very heavily.'' But Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashton </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> medical faculty, who was at the match and attended the dying, said on TV Channel 4 News: `` I saw no evidence whatsoever of drunkenness, nor of looting nor of people urinating on policemen.'' The chief constable of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION> police, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, refused comment on the argument, saying he had ordered his officers not to pre-empt an inquiry into police control of the crowd. A small crowd of Liverpudlians burned a stack of newspapers Wednesday with the police claims on the front page. The team's stadium was carpeted with flowers, scarves and other soccer memorabilia as scores of people continued paid tribute to the dead. <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Kevas </PERSON> <PERSON> Coombes </PERSON> accused police of spreading `` baseless, malicious and wicked'' allegations. `` None of these allegations were made at the time and any lawyer will know that they have the hallmarks of an attempt to create a cover story to cover for their incompetence,'' he said. Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>, whose department is in charge of the police, and lawmaker <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Blunkett </PERSON>, whose constituency includes <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION> stadium, both appealed for an end to recriminations. `` It is sad and wrong that there were 24 hours of great dignity and mourning _ and now as a country we seem to be plunging downhill into a mess of accusations and counteraccusations which changed that right atmosphere to the wrong,'' said <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>.

 The search for two crewmen swept into the sea after their ship sank continued a third day Wednesday, with rescuers holding out hope that the temperate water of the Gulf Stream might help the men survive. Spotters aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> airplane were directing the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter <LOCATION> Chilula </LOCATION> in an area about 400 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Petty Officer <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawley </PERSON>. The cutter was carrying the 23 sailors who were rescued after the freighter Star of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> sank in stormy seas Monday morning. The crew of a search plane reported spotting one of the missing crewmen Tuesday, but found no further signs, <PERSON> Crawley </PERSON> said. `` Both crewmen are being presumed to be alive,'' he said. `` They're near the Gulf Stream. The water temperature is n't that cold.'' Survivors said one of the missing men jumped overboard from the sinking ship and appeared to be injured. The other was wearing a life jacket when he was washed off a life raft. The 23 multinational crew members were picked up by the freighter Ravenscraig, which was diverted to the scene the after rescue planes spotted a life boat and a life raft. A second life raft was recovered but was empty, <PERSON> Crawley </PERSON> said. The Chilula arrived at the search area Tuesday to collect the rescued crewmen from the 950-foot Ravenscraig. <PERSON> Crawley </PERSON> said officials still did n't know what made the Star of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> sink. `` They had reported they were taking on water, why we do n't know,'' he said The 500-foot freighter was bound for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. The Star of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> was registered in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and designed to carry bulk freight.

The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>, citing unnamed sources, reported Wednesday that the third missing woman was <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, daughter of a retired <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> police officer. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> would not confirm the identity but said the woman's family had provided information to the district attorney. `` The family has said they have not seen or heard from her since last summer,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. `` They filed a missing person report with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> police.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Standard-Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bedford </ORGANIZATION> reported that 34-year-old <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was initially reported missing in April 1988, but was seen in the city in June. Her family reported her missing again in December after reports of the highway killings. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> had ties to the city's drug community, as did the eight victims and the two other missing women, The <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported. The Standard-Times said <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was a heroin addict and had been arrested on drug charges in 1984 and 1985, but unlike some of the other victims, she had no record of prostitution. A grand jury, which was first convenced in February to hear evidence in the case, is scheduled to reconvene on April 27. The investigation has produced four suspects, but no arrests have been made.

 The federal government is shortchanging the nation's second-largest city in the fight against drugs because of an <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> bias, officials based here said. `` The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> has not been heard politically as much as the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zietner </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> office, said Tuesday in a presentation before the Board of Supervisors. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> called for more federal resources, saying that <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> has become one of the nation's main sources for drugs.

<TEXT>
 The Senate Labor and Human Resources approved a bill Wednesday to require large employers to provide up to 10 weeks of unpaid leave for parents of new babies. The vote was 10-6. The bill, similar to a measure awaiting <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor action, also would require employers to make 10 weeks available for workers to care for a seriously ill child or parent. And it would require them to grant up to 13 weeks a year unpaid leave in the even of serious illness of the employee. The bill, sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., would apply to employers of 20 or more people Similar Dodd legislation cleared the committee last year, but failed to overcome an informal filibuster mounted by <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> opponents on the floor. Parental leave legislation is a main part of the overall Democratic domestic agenda this year _ along the minimum wage, federal child care and health care for the uninsured. Party leaders have agreed informally that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will go first this year with its version of the parental leave bill. Parental leave legislation was not considered by the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last year.

<HEAD>Fire Near Capitol Tests Smoke-Control System</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> burned 500 pounds of wood in an old <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> hotel Wednesday in an experiment to help decide whether it's worthwhile to try to control smoke in building fires. The institute's system confined smoke from the fire to one floor of the seven-story brick building, which was studded throughout with more than 100 temperature-measuring devices and other instruments measuring air pressure and gas concentrations. The institute, known until recently as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION>, is part of the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Smoke control systems have come into increasing use in office buildings over the past decade, but officials of the institute said such systems had not been challenged extensively by real fires. What systems there are have been constructed according to theoretical calculations and rules of thumb drawn up by fire experts. The cause of many fire fatalities is listed as `` smoke inhalation,'' which frequently may be carbon monoxide from incomplete combustion or other toxic gases given off by a fire. Much of the $ 40 billion in annual property damage from fires also results from smoke, and `` it does n't take much to gum up your computer disks'' even if the flames never get close, observed <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Snell </PERSON>, director of the institute's <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. `` The big question in the fire protection field is, Does smoke control work? And under what circumstances does it make sense to add it to building requirements?'' <PERSON> Snell </PERSON> told reporters attending the demonstration burn at the old Plaza Hotel between the Capitol and Union Station. The building is to be demolished. Some experts question whether sprinkler-protected buildings need a smoke control system. To work properly, such systems must supply air to the fire, which may make it grow `` and these are the tradeoffs,'' said <PERSON> Snell </PERSON>. Smoke control works by using a building's existing air-handling system to pressurize the stairwells and the floors above and below the fire floor. Existing fire sensors can be used to trigger the proper arrangement of fans. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION> and the Madison Building of the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have smoke control systems. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Klute </PERSON>, director of Wednesday's experiment, said such systems should add `` a small fraction'' to the cost of ventilation systems. In Wednesday's test, 2,000 cubic-feet-per-minute fans pumped air into the first and third floors of the hotel while a fan of the same size withdraw air from the second floor, where a pyre of 2 inch-by-2 inch fir sticks burned in a fireproofed room about 10 feet by 11 feet in front of an open windown about four feet square. A fan of 9,000 cubic feet per minute pressurized the single stairwell in the building. The open window made it `` the most severe test so far,'' said <PERSON> Klute </PERSON>. This meant the difference in air pressure between the fire floor and the adjacent floors would be about half the difference recommended for current smoke control schemes. Flames and black smoke denoting incomplete combustion poured out of the open window and licked the window above. At one point, the temperature sensor closest to the fire indicated 2,696 degrees Fahrenheit, and the carbon monoxide content of the hallway was shown as almost 0.5 percent _ half what it had been in previous tests of fires in the hallway with all windows closed. But television monitors on every floor and every landing of the stairwell showed no smoke throughout the test, even though the second-floor hallway was full of opaque smoke above a few inches off the floor at 6 minutes 43 seconds after ignition, and completely full shortly after that.

 One week before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> hears arguments in a key abortion-rights case, an abortion rights group Wednesday took to the airwaves with a $ 2 million ad campaign while an anti-abortion group said it plans to run newspaper ads next week to stir <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s grass roots. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday began running television, radio and newspaper ads to present their side and build on the energy displayed at an abortion-rights march that drew at least 300,000 to the nation's Capitol earlier this month. Meantime, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> plans on Thursday to deliver more than 200,000 letters to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday asking the department to drop its attempt to persuade the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to overturn the landmark 1973 decision legalizing abortion. The <ORGANIZATION> NARAL </ORGANIZATION> ads are designed `` to awaken <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s pro-choice majority _ the sleeping giant that is just now hearing the alarm,'' said <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> NARAL </ORGANIZATION>. The ads were being run in four state capital cities _ <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. On Sunday, the ads will begin in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and nationally on <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, she said. <ORGANIZATION> NARAL </ORGANIZATION>'s ads warn that without safe, legal abortions, women will be forced to turn to `` back alley'' abortions, and say the choice of whether to have an abortion should be made by women and their families, not the government. <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON> said the ad campaign is a first of its kind for the group, warranted by the imminent danger to abortion rights posed by a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case that will be heard by the high court. Though many doubt the court in this case will reverse its landmark <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> ruling that legalized first-trimester abortions, many say the court could allow states to impose more restrictions on abortions. Oral arguments are scheduled for April 26. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said it is planning to run a four-page insert in <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> on April 25 and to run the ad in other papers around the country after that, said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Donehey </PERSON>, a spokesman for the group. <PERSON> Donehey </PERSON>, who estimated the cost of the campaign at $ 150,000, said the ads will include information on the types of abortion procedures performed, the developmental characteristics of a fetus, the effect of abortion on women and profiles of women who carried babies to term instead of aborting them. <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON> said her group's ad campaign is not intended to lobby the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, but she said the court `` is not immune to the social values and political environment of the country.'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinegar </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said his group is n't trying to sway the high court, but wants to take advantage of the attention it has focused on the abortion issue. `` This is the best time to educate people on the issue because it's so hot right now,'' he said. etters, xxx

<HEAD>Academy Members Criticize Georgia Clash, Law on Dissident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s campaign speech before fellow Soviet scientists was upstaged Wednesday when one of his colleagues publicly apologized for denouncing the nuclear physicist nine years ago. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> is running for one of the seats in the new Soviet parliament reserved for the Academy of Sciences. He and other reformist candidates at Wednesday's election meeting criticized a new decree on dissent and authorities for the deaths of 20 protesters in a clash in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. The scientist who followed the human rights activist to the podium at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, however, was the one who electrified the hall. The elderly man, who identified himself only as <PERSON> Vonsovsky </PERSON>, said he was ashamed to admit that he signed a letter to the Soviet Presidium denouncing <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> after the physicist criticized the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979. `` I committed a very bad act,'' <PERSON> Vonsovsky </PERSON> said in front of hundreds of top Soviet scientists. `` I am offering a profound apology.'' `` I would like to say that <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> is our honor, our pride, and our conscience,'' <PERSON> Vonsovsky </PERSON> said. The Presidium cited such letters when it stripped <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> of his numerous awards and accused him of subversion in early 1980. He was exiled from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to the provincial city of <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION>. In 1986, he was freed when President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power and began releasing dissidents. The academy is scheduled to vote Thursday to fill the 12 of its 20 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies that were left empty after its first round of voting last month. In his speech, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said an April 8 decree barring `` insults and discrediting'' of the government should be rescinded. He also criticized laws that allow authorities to use special troops to clear demonstrations. Critics charge that by banning statements that discredit Soviet officials, the new decree threatens citizens with prison or fines for speaking the truth about officials who do their jobs poorly. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> also blamed the April 9 tragedy in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, on such laws and on forces opposing perestroika, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s drive to restructure Soviet society. Hundreds of academy members voted to support a resolution of its branch in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> that termed the April 9 clash an `` unprecedented massive beating of innocent people.'' At least 20 people died when soldiers moved into a crowd of demonstrators on <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>'s main street. A commission is investigating charges that soldiers used poison gas, shovels and clubs. The academy holds 20 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies that will meet for the first time on May 25. Of the congress' 2,250 seats, 750 will be held by members elected from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and its affiliates, trade unions, social and professional organizations like the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. Elections in 1,500 geographical districts were held March 26. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s supporters organized a campaign against the 23 candidates chosen by the academy's election commission for the 20 seats and in voting last month succeeded in preventing 15 of them from getting 50 percent of the vote. The academy was required to organize a second election, and last week <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was chosen to be among the 28 nominees.

<HEAD>Sri Lanka Cease-Fire Ends, No Accord with Sinhalese Radicals</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government's weeklong cease-fire ended Wednesday with Sinhalese radicals demanding a pullout of Indian troops and new elections before any peace talks. `` It is pointless carrying a gun in one hand and calling for peace talks with the other,'' said a statement issued by the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the main militant group of the majority Sinhalese. The government extended the cease-fire to both ethnic Tamil rebels fighting for a homeland and militant Sinhalese who want tougher measures against the Tamils. Despite escalated violence that left 100 people dead over the past week, Tamil militants said Saturday they were ready for talks on ending their six-year-long insurgency. President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> ordered suspension of military operations against the extremists to give them a chance to surrender and join the political mainstream. Militant Sinhalese said talks should wait until new parliamentary and presidential elections are held and Indian troops leave the country. They also demanded disbanding of vigilante groups blamed for killing suspected militants in the Sinhalese-dominated south. The government reacted by calling on the militants to hold preliminary negotiations anyway. `` It is appropriate that an informal discussion is held on preliminary issues that would ... create a basis of trust as a prerequisite for a dialogue,'' said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ranjan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijeratna </PERSON>. He made no comment on the militant demands. The Tamil militants have appointed <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Balasingham </PERSON>, a Sri Lankan-born Tamil who is a British citizen, to start the peace talks. <PERSON> Balasingham </PERSON>, the recently named head of the rebels' political section, is expected to arrive soon from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, according to presidential spokesman <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooray </PERSON> No date has been announced for the talks. Military officials said 233 Sinhalese radicals surrendered during the cease-fire. No Tamil militants surrendered, they said. Sinhalese extremists launched their anti-government campaign in 1987 after former President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> signed an India-sponsored peace accord with Tamil rebels. The Sinhalese radicals said the pact, which called for greater Tamil autonomy, made too many concessions to the Tamils. The rebels later renounced the accord and began fighting Indian peacekeeping troops sent to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to promote the plan. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> became involved in the ethnic tensions of this island off its southern coast because of the sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils for the rebels. Tamils, who are mostly Hindu, comprise 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people They complain of discrimination in jobs and education and demand a northeastern homeland. <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s government and military has been dominated by the Sinhalese since the island, formerly called <ORGANIZATION> Ceylon </ORGANIZATION>, became independent from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1948. Sinhalese, who are predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Buddhists </ORGANIZATION>, make up 75 percent of the population. About 12,600 people have died in the ethnic violence over the past six years.

Adm. <PERSON> Huntington </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardisty </PERSON>, commander-in-chief of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said he believes the two countries can agree on an extension to the pact when the lease expires on the six bases expires in 1991. `` Everyone has an interest in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remaining in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hardisty </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're good friends, we're good allies and I hope that relationship will continue.''

 An <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> jet carrying the company's president and five other people landed safely Wednesday after circling for nearly five hours because of a problem with its nose landing gear, officials said The Gulfstream III twin-engine jet took off about 5:30 a.m. from <LOCATION> Midway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> with three company executives, including President <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurance </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, and three crew members en route to <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> by way of <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. `` It landed without incident at 10:32 a.m.,'' at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mort </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON>. `` The nose gear never retracted,'' <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON> said. `` They requested a flyby from the control tower, and they looked with binoculars and said ` no, it has not retracted.''' The $ 19 million jet circled Midway for about 4 -LCB- hours in 40-mile circles to burn off fuel before heading to <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> for the landing, <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON> said. `` It's a standard thing to do,'' he said. `` In the case of a crash, there's a better chance for survival'' if the fuel tanks are empty.

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Law enforcement officials refused Wednesday to confirm published reports of a planned terrorist attack here, but some resort patrons said they noticed tighter security in the city's 12 casinos. Casino operators and Boardwalk vendors reported business as usual despite reports that police were looking for two Arab men planning a terrorist attack. The reports were linked to anonymous sources in Wednesday's editions of The Star-Ledger of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> and The Press of <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. State police on Wednesday monitored the three main roads into <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Plainclothes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> detectives increased their surveillance of casinos, according to the two newspapers. The assault was scheduled sometime from April 14 to April 20, the newspapers said. Authorities said the attack was to be in retaliation for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing on April 15, 1986, of <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s headquarters, according to the newspapers. Two weeks ago, a British newspaper reported that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> planned attacks on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines and other American targets to mark the anniversary of the bombing. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s news agency <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> has denied the reports, which were tied to a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence official. Spokesmen for the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasquale </PERSON> declined to comment on the case. State Police Superintendent Col. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Pagano </PERSON> refused to comment on whether his force was on alert. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> declined comment Wednesday, but noted that one year ago, alleged terrorist <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> was arrested on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turnpike </LOCATION>. In February, <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> was sentenced to 30 years in prison on explosives and weapons charges. `` I think we showed he was going to carry out his bombing mission on April 14,'' <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> said. `` We are now just about a year later. Whatever inferences anybody wants to draw from that they can.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Carver </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, refused to say whether casinos had increased security or police had added patrols. He also declined to speculate on the effects the newspaper report would have on visitors. `` I think the weather has more to do with the attendance in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> than anything else,'' <PERSON> Carver </PERSON> said. Operators of some Boardwalk businesses and casinos said the customer flow was normal Wednesday. <PERSON> Circe </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mack </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, a popular restaurant on the <LOCATION> Boardwalk </LOCATION>, said some of her customers noticed additional security measures at casinos and on the highways.

After months of complaints by faculty and students, Chancellor <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Milley </PERSON> has resigned, effective June 30, from the top job at the school, part of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>. The school's <ORGANIZATION> Faculty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> voted 11-0 last March to call for her resignation; the council had taken a no-confidence vote in November, too, in which it was joined by 85 of 89 faculty members. The university system's Board of Governors voted this month to give Ms. <PERSON> Milley </PERSON>, 48, a paid leave of absence and then appoint her as a music instructor, beginning Jan. 1, at a salary of $ 58,600, or $ 6,000 higher than the music dean's. Her chancellor's salary is $ 86,000. However, students at the school said they did n't like the deal; this week, they took to the streets. First, a student sat in the chancellor's parking space and played an oboe. Next, students staged the `` Bard-a-thon'' _ a reading of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s 154 sonnets and 13 plays. Other performance protests included chamber music concerts, interpretive dance in front of a banner proclaiming `` Milley Must Go,'' and juggling. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON>, a former drama student at the school, stood on a outdoor stage and read telegrams from Oscar-nominee <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hulce </PERSON>, television star <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Guinee </PERSON> and Broadway actress <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> in support of the students. `` We're not trying to railroad her out of town,'' said <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Cory </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON>, 26, a graduate student in technical direction and production management and one of the organizers of the protest. `` We just want her to relinquish her power now.'' In 1984, Ms. <PERSON> Milley </PERSON> was named chancellor, the first non-composer to hold the post. Soon after her appointment, her management style came in for criticism as being abrasive and crisis-oriented. Critics also said she would n't delegate authority.

<HEAD>Philippine Vice President Says He's `Jobless'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> vice president at odds with President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, described himself on Wednesday as being in `` a state of suspended animation'' as he prepares a bid for his nation's top office. Laurel, who spoke with reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, is visiting <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to meet with congressional leaders and highlight his views in advance of next month's national convention of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Nacionalista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He has said he expects to be one of several candidates who are going to `` throw their hat in the ring'' for the 1992 presidential elections. Although Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has said she will not seek re-election, it is possible that she may be drafted to run again. Relations are so poor between Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and her vice president that they do not speak. Although <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said his visit was not geared around criticism at Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, the majority of his statements found fault with her government's battle against the nation's 20-year-old communist insurgency, as well as the approach to economic and political development. In contrast to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> system of government, the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> vice president has no duties under the constitution unless appointed to a position by the president. After a political falling out in 1987, <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> resigned his post as foreign minister and lately has been organizing an opposition party. `` I'm in a state of suspended animation,'' he said. Still, he quipped, `` as a jobless vice president, I'm able to travel more than others'' and visit with citizens. As for the insurgency, <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said rebel numbers have ballooned from 14,000 to 33,000 in the past three years. `` If we do n't put up a responsible, democratic opposition, the alternative we face is a violent opposition,'' he said. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official familiar with the situation in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> said, however, that the insurgency was not that large and that it `` has n't made any particular progress'' over the past several years. The official commented on condition he not be named. The vice president also said he differed with Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> on the issue of the negotiation of the future of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and he criticized a lack of movement on the issue. He argued that the Philippine government should enter into negotiations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as soon as possible, since the pact expires in 1991. <PERSON> Laruel </PERSON> did say Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> deserved credit for helping the nation through a rocky three years since former dictator <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> left the country. A civilian-military uprising in February 1986 ended <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' rule and swept Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and Laurel into power. But <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> argued that `` the transition from dictatorship to democracy'' wo n't be complete without the formation of a `` responsible, legitimate, organized opposition,'' which he said his party intends to be.

 Overloaded container trucks carrying European beer, paper products and ceramic tiles are violating <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> highway regulations and endangering trucking safety, a truckers group told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donohue </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trucking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associations </ORGANIZATION>, said the heavy containers packed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> increase stopping distances, decrease vehicle control and put additional stress on American trucks. <PERSON> Donohue </PERSON> said beer imports from <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> top the list of potentially overweight containers, followed by paper products and ceramic tile imported from various countries. `` By allowing imports such as beer to move at higher weights than those allowed domestic products, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is, in effect, providing an economic subsidy to foreign competitors,'' <PERSON> Donohue </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> lacks authority to regulate the containers because they are only illegal when they are carried on the highways, where enforcement agents fine truckers for the overweight cargoes. <PERSON> Donohue </PERSON> said a recent study by the highway administration indicates that a third of all import and export containers moving through <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ports are in possible violation of federal highway weight limits. The top violator among shipments for export is waste paper, he said.

 Soldiers fired on protesters who defied a military curfew Wednesday night and demanded the resignation of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s prime minister. Witnesses said three people were killed. Officials said at least 18 people have been injured in two days of rioting in the city of <LOCATION> Maan </LOCATION>, 120 miles south of <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>. The rioting, prompted by price increases and an economic austerity agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, spread to at least three other towns. The violence appeared to be the worst in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> since the army crushed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas in 1970-71 and drove them from the country. A police source said a 21-year-old army soldier on leave was fatally wounded in <LOCATION> Maan </LOCATION>. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, identified the man as <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlab </PERSON> <PERSON> Saudi </PERSON>. Saudi was on the roof of his house, watching protesters stoning government buildings and destroying police cars, when he was hit by a stray bullet, the source said. The source could not confirm the two other deaths. But residents in <LOCATION> Maan </LOCATION>, also speaking privately, said the two were among the protesters who took to the streets despite the curfew to call for the resignation of Prime Minister <PERSON> Zaid </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON>. They would not give details. King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON> were in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to discuss <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> peace efforts with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Asked about the disturbances, the monarch told reporters, `` Everything is under control.'' Earlier Wednesday, the government deployed a massive force of police and soldiers, some in armored cars and wearing riot gear, along major highways. But the unrest spread to <LOCATION> Tafilah </LOCATION>, 80 miles south of <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Husnyeih </PERSON>, 95 miles from the capital. These two cities and <PERSON> Maan </PERSON> remained under curfew, but residents reached by telephone said gunfire could be heard all afternoon. Witnesses said hundreds of rioters on Wednesday attacked at least seven banks in <LOCATION> Kerak </LOCATION>, 50 miles south of <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>. The streets of the city were filled with army officers, lined with charred buildings and littered with metallic debris. Windows of several government offices were smashed, and at least three burned cars lay at the entrance of the city. Crown <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>, acting as head of state in the king's absence, told reporters that 12 policemen and six civilians were injured in <LOCATION> Maan </LOCATION> He said arrests were made but did not say how many. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> has experienced little turmoil for 15 years, in large measure because of a rapid increase in living standards and education financed by aid from Arab oil states. That aid has declined recently, and the country has a $ 6 billion debt. Officials said trouble began when taxi drivers roused students to riot on Tuesday because the drivers were angered by a 25 percent increase in the price of gasoline, to the equivalent of $ 1.65 a gallon, and a doubling of the annual license fee to $ 370. Tires smoldered in <LOCATION> Maan </LOCATION>'s streets and young men changed demands for the resignation of <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON>, whose government announced price increases Sunday for gasoline, auto licenses and other items. Some chanted: `` This man must resign or we will burn the country!'' `` This govenment is all thieves!'' declared a youth who gave his name as <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON>, face shrouded by an Arab scarf and hands black with the soot of burning tires. Price increases are part of a deal with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> to reduce budget deficits and reschedule the foreign debt. They follow a year of rising unemployment and rapid inflation in which the dinar lost nearly 40 percent of its buying power, often doubling the prices of such imported goods as cars and appliances. Wages have not risen to compensate and the government also has cut overtime and other benefits for public employees. Most Jordanians earn between $ 185 and $ 370 a month.

<TEXT>
 A plan to integrate <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s public universities has the potential to halt generations of racial disparity, state officials said Wednesday. A special master appointed by a panel of federal judges recommended Tuesday that the state set up a single governing board for higher education, raise admission standards for some schools and make <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> the primary research school. The proposal also called for establishing a community college system and providing a specific percentage of each year's higher education budget for predominantly black colleges. The plan generally was well received by state officials. `` I think the students won,'' said Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>. `` I'm for it if it will improve the education of our students in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, if <ORGANIZATION> LSU </ORGANIZATION> will be enhanced as the flagship university and if we can provide a good education for our young people at a reduced cost,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Andonie </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> LSU </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> currently has four boards of higher education overseeing 17 institutions. Under the plan proposed by Special Master <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Verkuil </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, those boards would merge into one unified governing body with 17 voting members and a student member. <PERSON> Verkuil </PERSON> was appointed after black leaders, educators and politicians were unable to reach an agreement to end a 15-year-old lawsuit brought against the state by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Since December 1987, the state of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Grambling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alumni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> have been trying to come up with a desegregation proposal after an earlier settlement expired. Black leaders had feared a single higher education board would be insensitive to the needs of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s two major predominantly black universities, <ORGANIZATION> Grambling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in north <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Grambling </LOCATION> is governed by the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regents </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trustees </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees most of the predominantly white institutions. Southern has its own governing board. A three-judge federal panel that appointed <PERSON> Verkuil </PERSON> will have the final say on the proposal. The plan rejected the notion of closing or merging state universities for the time being, perhaps the most dreaded aspect of the desegregation talks. The governor got much of what the state wanted from the negotiations, including the superboard, which he was unable to push through the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> last year. `` We asked that the schools not be closed, but that the boards be merged, and the master has done this,'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said. `` He gave us some guidelines. Now we'll have to work with the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to see how much and how far he has gone.'' `` It may do for <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> what we could not do because of the politics of the circumstances,'' namely the competition among the college systems, said state Sen. <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkhaus </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Brinkhaus compared the situation to the public school desegregation fights of the 1960s when federal court orders overrode state law. `` We need to integrate our colleges. All of our citizens need to have the same opportunities,'' <PERSON> Andonie </PERSON> said. `` But I do n't know if the plan is going to work.'' A representative of the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trustees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colleges </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universities </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Verkuil </PERSON> has given the state an opportunity to properly integrate its higher education institutions. `` He has done it very wisely,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>, vice president for academic and research affairs. `` He did what the governor asked. He said, ` Let me get my one board in place and give that board the responsibility for doing these things.''' <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Clausen </PERSON>, commissioner of higher education, said, `` My initial reaction is this is probably the least disruptive set of recommendations that holds promise for desegregation and increased accessibility.''

 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials and the South African-appointed territorial administrator ordered separate investigations on Wednesday into reports of intimidation of civilians in northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. Reports said security forces and supporters of the <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> People's Organization were harassing villagers in the area of heavy fighting between the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African-controlled </LOCATION> police and military and the black nationalist guerrillas. Most allegations dealt with security forces. <PERSON> Martti </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> operation in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, ordered an inquiry because of `` increasing numbers of allegations of intimidation, assault and other misconduct,'' said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Cedric </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornberry </PERSON>. He would not elaborate. Later, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON>, who will administer the South-African controlled territory until completion of a U.N.-supervised independence process next year, said he also would set up a commission to investigate the allegations. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> police monitors are to be deployed in northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> this week and residents have been urged to report incidents of harassment or brutality. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which has ruled the territory for 74 years, has agreed to implement a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> independence plan in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s last colony <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> says about 1,600 <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas entered <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> starting April 1 in violation of an agreement that they remain at their bases in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> until at least mid-May. According to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, 279 guerrillas were killed; 32 captured; about 380 returned to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, and about 900 remain in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The deputy commander of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> forces, Brig.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the tourguide was at it again Wednesday, this time taking his guest for a spin on the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in a yacht _ snatched from drug dealers and fit for a king. Continuing a practice of taking <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> leaders on sightseeing trips around <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hosted <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> by making use of a yacht, now owned by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has shown a penchant of late for making sure his foreign guests get a taste of the tourist sights. The president took Egyptian President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> to the season opener baseball game in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> two weeks ago. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> then showed <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> the Air and Space Museum, one of the most popular tourist attractions in the capital. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s tour began with a historical tone. Before their cruise, the king and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flew by helicopter to nearby Mt. <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON>, the sprawling <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> riverside estate of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>. There, with an entourage of about 30 people, they toured the home while tourists waited outside on the spacious grounds. Then <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, trailed by a column of aides whose dark suits contrasted with the flowering trees and springtime greenery, descended a brick walkway to the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> where they received a lively sendoff from the Fife and Drum Corps of the Old Guard, 3rd <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Infantry. The fife and drum band was dressed in American Revolution costumes, with three-corner hats and red jackets. As how he liked his Mt. Vernon tour, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> smiled broadly and said, `` I enjoyed it very, very much. The two leaders boarded a 61-foot yacht named the Cinclantflt Barge for the 10-mile ride back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Confiscated from drug dealers in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the craft, equipped with a bar and other luxuries, is used for special functions of the chief of naval operations, according to <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> crew members who accompanied the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tour. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> remained inside the yact, seated around a conference table bedecked with a bowlof red roses and pink carnations. Among those accompanying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adviser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scowcroft </ORGANIZATION> and Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>. If <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> glanced out the porthole, he could have seen the luxurious homes along the riverbanks, the Revolutionary War-era <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and the historic harbor of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The sceneary Wednesday also included a burning automobile on the <LOCATION> Wilson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, just about wheere the Cinclanflt passed. A handful of police boats, including a District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> fireboat called the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, shooed away fishing and recreational boats and kept two large tour boats at dock until the presidents passed. After more than an hour of 12-knot travel, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> yacht anchored at <ORGANIZATION> Bolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, just south of the capital, and <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> headed off for lunch with Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> returned to meetings at the White House.

 Everybody gets a date to the prom at tiny <ORGANIZATION> Aquin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, but the ordeal of picking your partner is replaced by the luck of the draw. <LOCATION> Aquin </LOCATION>'s 63-year-old Prom Draw gives every girl a shot at going to the prom with the football captain and every boy a chance to date the head cheerleader. Boy's names, each in a sealed envelope, are drawn from a plastic milk crate, then matched with girl's names drawn from another crate. The parochial school's version of `` The Dating Game'' started late last week with 32 junior and senior boys bunched anxiously on wooden bleachers at the gym. `` For some of you, this will be the most agonizing 45 minutes you'll go through in a while _ enjoy it,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Pospischil </PERSON>, athletic director at the 113-student school. After the drawing, he said, each boy should go to the cafeteria, where 32 <LOCATION> Aquin </LOCATION> girls waited, and ask for a date from the girl they draw. `` What if they say no?'' asked junior <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Franz </PERSON>, a bunch of flowers by his sneaker-clad feet. `` They will not say no,'' replied <PERSON> Pospischil </PERSON>, as he reached into a crate to draw the first name. The system sounds like one that teen-agers might hate, but every time students get a chance to vote on it, they overwhelmingly approve it, said school officials in this northwestern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> city. `` The good thing about it is it's exciting and everyone gets a chance to go,'' said <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schopf </PERSON>, a junior. `` Besides, I got a good one this year and last year, too.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students gave a `` B-minus'' Wednesday to the first computerized election in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, but state officials graded it `` incomplete'' for a general election. A few hardware problems _ laser printers that sometimes `` forgot all their fonts'' and could n't record coded versions of the ballots _ caused some long lines when some polling places shut down briefly. But no hackers appeared to break into the system, as student election officials feared. `` We were anticipating a lot of cracker jacks trying to get into it, but we have n't noticed anything,'' said student elections commissioner <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Krauss </PERSON>. The estimated turnout of more than 6,000 voters over two days easily surpassed the 3,159 voters at a similar election last week at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> vote thus became the nation's largest test yet of whether computer terminals can replace paper ballots `` It was very simple to use and much easier than pressing the pins in the little holes on punchcard ballots,'' said sophomore <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Svoboda </PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION>'s women's basketball team. `` I think it would be good for general elections, especially for the younger generation,'' she said. `` It might be a little bit scary for the older generation who have n't used computers, but once someone showed them they'd be all right.'' Most students rated the system, which used Macintosh computers made by <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and software developed by sophomore <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON>, as very `` user friendly.'' Votes for the nearly 100 candidates for student senate and council of presidents were expected to be tallied within two hours of the closing of the polls Wednesday night. Last year, it took five days to get official results. In addition, this year's election cost about $ 3,000 less than the $ 13,00 price tag a year ago. State officials, observing the vote as a possible forerunner of general elections in the 21st century, came away impressed but not yet convinced that the voting public is ready to pick its leaders by computer `` mouse.'' General elections would require a direct record of a person's vote, not data on a hard disk that could possibly be altered or a coded printout that might not reflect the voter's choice, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mott-Smith </PERSON>, coordinator of voter outreach programs for the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Secretary of State's office Despite the problems, <PERSON> Krauss </PERSON> said he would give the computerized system a B-minus. `` There's plenty of room for improvement. We're not making any pretense about its ability to handle a general election. Paper ballots did n't vanish completely. They were still used for voting by students at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION>'s three overseas campuses, for absentee ballots and for those who simply refuse to use the computers.

<TEXT>
 Some <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> residents will have a long weekend thanks to a state holiday born in 1681 out of fear that its first governor was going to die. Monday is Fast Day. Until four years ago, the fourth Monday in April was observed widely as a spring Thanksgiving, with all state offices closed. But the state's contract with its workers now has made Fast Day a `` floating holiday,'' an optional day off that allows state offices to stay open. Although state offices will be open, some city and town offices will close, schools and banks will close, federal offices will be open and stores will have sales. Fast Day began with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cutt </PERSON>, about whom little is known other than he was `` President of the Royal Province of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> by grace of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>,'' and that he sometimes spelled his name <PERSON> Cutts </PERSON>. Cutt was the richest merchant in <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION>, the colonial capital. On May 6, 1680, when he was 60, he had a foreboding of his death and wrote his will. By next year, the Welsh immigrant was so ill that the colonial <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> declared a day of `` fasting, humiliation and prayer'' for his recovery. It was a peculiarly <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> custom to declare days of fasting and prayer whenever the colonists felt threatened by catastrophe. The first known fast day was observed by <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> after the drought of 1622. In 1894, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> substituted Fast Day with Patriots Day to observe the start of the Revolutionary War. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> observe Patriots Day on the third Monday in April. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s theological cure for Cutt failed. He died on April 1, 1681. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> used to observe as many as three Fast Days a year. By 1899, the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> decided on one and in 1949, with a view toward a three-day weekend, the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> settled on the fourth Monday in April. The nature of the observance has changed. Church attendance used to be mandatory. The 10-shilling fine against those taking part in `` labor, business or work of their ordinary calling'' was lifted long ago. Recreation no longer is forbidden. Now the holiday comes as <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>'s long winter gives way to spring, when snow tires and storm windows are packed away in garages, when schools begin a week of vacation, and when golf courses become snow-free.

 <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON>'s attorney general was killed Wednesday by a bomb that his driver said was placed on top of his car at an intersection. The rightist president-elect blamed leftist guerrillas. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarado </PERSON>, 53, was killed instantly by the blast, said <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Orellana </PERSON>, the driver. The explosion ripped a hole through the roof of the attorney general's Jeep Cherokee. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> is the highest-ranking government official slain since the civil war began in 1981. An estimated 70,000 Salvadorans, most of them civilians, have been killed in the conflict. Neither the driver nor a bodyguard in the jeep was visibly wounded, but both complained of partial deafness from the blast. No group immediately claimed responsibility. President-elect <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> blamed leftist guerrillas battling the U.S.-backed government. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> called the assassination a `` brutal, despicable killing'' and said the act was designed to provoke further violence. `` We condemn this terrorism,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>. The rebels' <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> last month accused the attorney general's office of `` covering up for murderers.'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> was a militant of <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, or Arena. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s attorney general, the government's chief prosecutor, is not a Cabinet official and is appointed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which is controlled by <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> had held the post since December. <PERSON> Orellana </PERSON> told journalists the jeep stopped at a downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> traffic light at 7:45 a.m. when a young man placed something on the roof. The driver said he immediately tried to accelerate, but the bomb exploded. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, who was having breakfast with foreign correspondents when the attack occurred, condemned what he termed `` the brutal assassination by Marxist guerrillas.'' He said, `` This kind of act goes to show they -LRB- the rebels -RRB- are not looking for peace, but rather trying to provoke a vengeful response by security forces.'' <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said the guerrillas hoped to prompt an increase in abuse of human rights by security forces that guerrilla sympathizers could use to isolate his government. El Salvador depends heavily on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic and military aid. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said continued aid will depend on the new government's human rights record. The guerrillas, in a March 17 broadcast on their clandestine Radio Venceremos, accused the attorney general's office of `` covering up for murderers.'' The broadcast did not refer to any specific incidents and contained no explicit threat against <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>. Also Wednesday, President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, who is dying of liver cancer, left <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> for a week's analysis and treatment at <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s health is deteriorating, but he is expected to be able to personally hand over power to <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> on June 1. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> was elected on March 19. The armed forces and the rebels meanwhile announced that government forces killed an Argentine doctor, identified as <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Islas </PERSON> <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON>, and a French nurse, <PERSON> Madelaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Languedoc </PERSON>, on Saturday along with Salvadoran guerrillas. Rebel radio said the two foreigners and three rebels were killed after being captured in an army attack on a rebel field hospital in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vicente </LOCATION> province. An armed forces communique said the foreigners were armed guerrilla fighters killed in combat along with seven Salvadoran insurgents. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> told journalists the embassy concluded the foreigners were killed in combat. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said no field hospital existed at the battle site 30 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said the two were medical workers with the guerrillas but noted such personnel frequently double as combatants. The embassy based its conclusions on armed forces information, he said.

 Israelis gathered for festive meals Wednesday to begin Passover, the holiday commemorating the liberation of the ancient Israelites from slavery. Security forces were on high alert in case of guerrilla attacks. Thousands of people went to resorts on the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> and Sea of <LOCATION> Galilee </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, secular Israelis jammed beaches and outdoor restaurants. Army and police alerts were ordered because the 16-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories increased fear of guerrilla attacks during the holiday. The army stepped up its forces to prevent infiltrations across <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s borders. Since January, 31 guerrillas have been killed in a dozen attacks along the border with <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Police were out in force in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s walled <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to prevent disruptions of religious services, a national police spokesman said. In downtown <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, police discovered a small explosive device in a paint bucket left on the sidewalk near a cafe, but experts defused it, police spokesman <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandori </PERSON> reported. Passover, which commemorates the flight of the Israelites from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, began at sundown Wednesday with a traditional meal known as the seder. It includes such symbolic foods as bitter herbs to remind Jews of the harshness of their enslavement, and an unleavened bread called matzoh. During the week-long holiday many Jews abstain from bread, beer and other products made with yeast to remember the Israelites, who left <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> so quickly they had no time to leaven their bread. The holiday derives its name from the book of Exodus, which recounts that God `` passed over'' the homes of Israelites when meting out the worst of 10 plagues, and killed the first-born of every Egyptian. The plagues forced the pharaoh to let the Jews leave <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> participated in a symbolic outdoor seder organized by Soviet Jewish activists to thank the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for supporting Soviet Jews who have been refused permission to emigrate. Organizers set up a table on the sidewalk across the street from the embassy, serving wine and traditional Passover dishes. The army served Passover meals at military bases, but soldiers serving in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> were given grape juice instead of the traditional four cups of red wine, an army spokesman said. In a goodwill gesture for the holiday, more than 700 prisoners serving time for criminal offenses were given forloughs of two to four days, said <PERSON> Shuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Meiri </PERSON>, a prison services spokeswoman.

<HEAD>Rules Proposed to Speed States in Child-Support Enforcement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government proposed regulations Wednesday designed to force states to pursue child support more vigorously by requiring them to supply information for collection orders promptly. `` In the past, some states have not given sufficient attention'' to such efforts, said Health and Human Srvices Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. `` Millions of children have suffered because of this lack of attention.'' Delay in action by the states, he said, has prevented children from receiving financial support they are due. The regulations, which implement the Family Support Act passed last year by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in a major welfare overhaul, sets time limits for states to respond to requests for assistance in establishing and enforcing child support orders. Limits would be established for opening and maintaining case records, locating absent parents, establishing paternity, enforcing support obligations and receiving and distributing support payments. The regulations also provide criteria for states to use in determining whether to close a child support case. States would be required to comply with those time limits by Oct. 1, 1990. The regulations were published in Wednesday's Federal Register. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> set a 60-day comment period, after which the department will issue final rules.

 Thousands of police rushed a crowd of 3,000 pro-democracy activists on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s main boulevard early Thursday, beating some protesters and taking away others. `` Fascists, dogs!'' members of the crowd yelled at police as they ran to safety. `` Hoodlums and bandits!'' Police by the thousands charged the crowd at 3:30 a.m., sending protesters fleeing east past <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, the site of three days of rallies calling for political reform and commemorating the death of purged <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>. At one corner about eight police officers grabbed a woman in her 20s. One officer ripped off the sleeve of her coat. Other officers slapped her face. Another protester on a bicycle also was hit. Three officers knocked him to the ground and began kicking him. Chinese protesters said they saw at least six other people being beaten. Some protesters threw bottles at police. There were no figures on arrests, but an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter saw two people being put into a police jeep. Chinese witnesses said they saw about eight people being taken away. About 200 police also rushed a crowd of several hundred protesters in the western section of the city, kicking and beating demonstrators who did not run quickly enough. Another group of about 150-200 students who had been blocking the front of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters at <LOCATION> Zhongnanhai </LOCATION> were taken away in a bus. Its destination was not known. In <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, about 1,000 students and workers marched Wednesday to the central People's Square. One worker was arrested after speaking to the crowd about `` the destruction of my life by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' Police surrounded the square to keep onlookers away, and the demonstration broke up about 7 p.m., foreign and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> sources said. In both <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> the demonstrations _ the largest since nationwide student protests in the winter of 1986-87 _ were triggered by Saturday's death of Hu at age 73. Hu, acclaimed by students for protecting the rights of intellectuals, was forced to resign in January 1987 after being blamed by conservatives for failing to take a harsh line against the student demonstrations. The marchers in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> demanded freedom of speech and press and more money for education. They also said that `` people who do n't understand science should not hold high office. `` Down with dictatorship!'' the students chanted. `` Long live freedom, long live democracy!'' More than 15,000 people watched activists lead a rally Wednesday evening from atop a monument to revolutionary heroes on <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, the hallowed symbolic center of communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The monument was draped with dozens of wreaths and banners eulogizing <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> and carrying slogans such as `` long live democracy and freedom.'' About 10:30 p.m., students led a march to <LOCATION> Zhongnanhai </LOCATION>, 300 yards to the west of the square. About half the crowd gathered in front of the red-walled compound, while thousands stood in the back with their bicycles. About 6,000 participated, double the number of Tuesday night when about 500 police finally dispersed the crowd with a show of force. `` We do n't need to go in, just let <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> come out!'' students in the back shouted. <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, who became premier a year ago, is regarded as being cool toward rapid economic and political reform. He said recently that `` excessive democracy'' is bad for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and stressed that the main priority was social stability. As midnight neared, police succeeded in splitting most of the crowd from <LOCATION> Zhongnanhai </LOCATION>, sending several hundred fleeing west, and several thousand east. Students to the east of the compound staged a sit-in on <PERSON> Changan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jie </PERSON>, the city's main boulevard.

 Attackers ambushed and shot up the first truck convoy of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> famine relief effort intended to save 100,000 lives in the southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> war zone, killing seven armed escorts, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said Wednesday. They said a civilian driver and two assistants were wounded, and radio reports from the scene identified the slain escorts as members of the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> did not affix blame for the attack on the 14-truck convoy, but speculation centered on nomadic tribal warriors, army soldiers or government-sponsored militias operating against the rebels. The attack occurred Tuesday about 20 miles west of <LOCATION> Kapoeta </LOCATION>, a rebel base in southeastern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, 50 miles north of the <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> border. It was another setback for Operation Lifeline-Sudan, the $ 132 million <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> relief program plagued by delays caused by bureaucracy, bad weather and equipment shortages. Relief officials said the trucks were carrying 100 tons of food, medicine and other supplies to <LOCATION> Torit </LOCATION>, 100 miles west of <LOCATION> Kapoeta </LOCATION>, when they were halted by rocket and automatic weapons fire. It was the first convoy to <LOCATION> Torit </LOCATION> under the U.N.-sponsored effort to stockpile more than 100,000 tons of supplies in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> before heavy rains beginning next month make transport virtually impossible. Even before the attack, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials had conceded they probably could not meet their goals before the rainy season, which lasts until November. `` We think it is an isolated incident. We do n't think it represents a breach of agreement on the part of either party,'' said <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Weathers </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>. A statement issued in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, personal representative of Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> for the project, said the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> `` would like to draw the world's attention to the dangerous consequences that repetition of such action could have on the future of Operation Lifeline-Sudan. Operation Lifeline began April 1 after agreement in March by the Sudanese government and rebels to allow relief supplies through their lines for a month. Western relief organizations say up to half a million people died in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> last year of starvation caused by the 6-year-old civil war, drought and floods. Rebels led by former army Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garang </PERSON> demand greater autonomy and more economic help for the blacks of the south, most of whom are Christians or animists, from the Arabs in the Moslem north who control the government. A French monitor for the World Food Program was riding with the convoy and reported the attack Tuesday night to officials coordinating the relief operation from <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the lead vehicle was destroyed by `` some sort of missile'' and the rebel escorts came under fire from automatic weapons. He said the escorts were believed to be members of the <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an agency of the rebel army. Ms. <PERSON> Weathers </PERSON> said they were armed. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said use of Operation Lifeline's overland route to <LOCATION> Torit </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Kapoeta </LOCATION> would be suspended indefinitely but an airlift to <LOCATION> Torit </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Entebbe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>, would begin Friday. Operations officer <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Torit </LOCATION>'s population had grown from 3,000 to 25,000 as displaced southern Sudanese seeking food and shelter arrived from the <PERSON> bush </PERSON>, and was expected to reach 50,000 in a few weeks. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> had planned to move 25,000 tons of food and supplies from <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> to southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> before the rains, but convoys have taken only 120 tons to <LOCATION> Kapoeta </LOCATION> so far. Norwegian People's Aid, in conjunction with World Vision of <LOCATION> Monrovia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, has trucked several thousand tons of food to <LOCATION> Kapoeta </LOCATION> since October in another relief effort. An airlift from <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION> operated by the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> has carried 3,000 tons of food and other supplies to <LOCATION> Juba </LOCATION>, the southern provincial capital swollen by refugees to a population of 300,000.

 Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday that industry plans for responding to catastrophes such as last month's Alaskan oil spill were `` zero'' and said federal and state officials should have required improvements. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> also said he was `` disappointed'' in <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s response to the 10-million gallon oil spill that occurred when a tanker collided with a well-marked reef in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> on March 24. Testifying before the same <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, a top <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> official acknowleged that industry plans for so massive a spill were inadequate. But <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, disputed any claim that his company's response had been slow. Yet, one Republican senator, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, ridiculed <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s early efforts to deal with the environmental damage. `` From all accounts, the cleanup crews initially responding to this spill acted more like the <ORGANIZATION> Keystone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kops </ORGANIZATION> than the well-trained oil spill response team described in the industry's contingency plan,'' he said. Most witnesses before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s environmental protection subcommittee _ from federal officials to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s governor and industry executives _ said that plans for dealing with a spill of oil from the Alaskan pipeline had not imagined an accident on the magnitude of the spill that followed the grounding of the Exxon Valdez. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, asked to evaluate the plan developed by a consortium of oil companies that ship oil from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> slope through the pipeline and <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> harbor, said the document should not have been approved by the state and should have brought warnings from the federal government that the plan was inadequate. `` On the scale of one to 10, it was a zero,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said of the standby procedures. The secretary told the panel that, before the tanker ran aground, everyone had `` assumed that this would never happen.'' `` I do n't think anybody was ready to deal with a spill of this magnitude,'' said <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, whose department oversees the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. The subcommittee's chairman, Sen. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., complained that `` there has never been a time when this situation was under control. He said the response to the spill has demonstrated `` a complete breakdown'' of the procedures that were supposed to have been in effect since the federal government approved the Alaskan pipeline 16 years ago. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> blamed complacency at all levels for the poor preparedness, but also said that there had not been adequate equipment on hand, that channels of authority were unclear and that a lack of leadership and direction in the critical hours after the spill further delayed cleanup efforts. He suggested that Alaskans had trusted the oil industry, which accounts for 85 percent of the state government's revenue, to take precautions. `` We feel like we've been assaulted,'' he told the senators. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's decision to leave the primary responsibility for the cleanup in <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s hands stemmed from a belief that the company had committed itself to the cleanup and `` had the technical expertise to deal with the problem.'' He said he has been `` disappointed'' that the giant oil company has not been able to assemble resources more effectively to better protect the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> coastline. Exxon President <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said that before the March 24 accident, such a severe accident was viewed as `` so highly unlikely that the consequences of it ... were viewed as acceptable.'' Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, said that the effects of the spill will last many years and that the price tag could exceed $ 1 billion. Suggesting that many Americans still can not comprehend the extent of damage, he said the area touched by contamination is the size of three of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> and that if the spill had occurred in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, the oil today `` would be almost down to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>'' Some members of the committee complained about President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s reaction, with Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> saying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had been `` slow to comprehend the magnitude of this disaster. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has been involved in the cleanup since the start, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not provide for stepped up federal participation until April 7, two weeks after the spill, when he put Adm. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> commandant, in charge and committed military assistance to the effort. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> senator, said he too had been disappointed that the president did not act more quickly, telling the committee, `` If a sea fence had been deployed within a matter of hours, this would have been a containable spill.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself has said he may have acted too slowly, telling the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION> last week that, as for the commitment of federal assistance, `` maybe I should accept some criticism on whether I should have done this a week before we did. ... If there's a lesson here that one agency or another might have moved faster, I will be the first to learn from that.''

<HEAD>Georgia Clash Victims Suffer from Poison Resembling Nerve Toxin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Soviet government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that some victims of a clash between soldiers and protesters in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> are suffering from a poison resembling a nerve toxin. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>'s interview with <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s health minister, <PERSON> Irakliy </PERSON> <PERSON> Menagarishvili </PERSON>, appeared to bolster charges by activists in the southern republic that soldiers used a toxic substance to break up a nationalist demonstration April 9 on <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>'s main street. The clash killed 20 people. <PERSON> Izvestia </PERSON> did not say how many of the 140 people still hospitalized after the confrontation were suffering from symptoms of poisoning. The new <ORGANIZATION> Georgian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, <PERSON> Givi </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumbaridze </PERSON>, said in an interview on Soviet television Wednesday that the situation remained tense in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> despite lifting a curfew and withdrawing soldiers. `` A wall of alienation remains,'' he said. `` It is necessary that the people discover the truth.'' <PERSON> Gumbaridze </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chief of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, last week replaced <PERSON> Dzhumber </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patiashvili </PERSON>, who accepted responsibility for the bloodshed and resigned. <PERSON> Menagarishvili </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> leading toxicologists believed the substance used on protesters had `` an irritating and atropine-like effect.'' He said scientists in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> were involved in diagnosing the cases. Atropine is a poisonous crystalline alkaloid. In large doses it can induce nerve paralysis and delirium. It can cause death through combined cardiac and respiratory failure. <LOCATION> Georgian </LOCATION> activists claim that people died after being gassed, but officials have not confirmed this. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda on Wednesday said <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials acknowledged tear gas was used in two places to break up protesters. But Pravda quoted the unidentified spokeman as saying regular army soldiers could not have used gas because it is not standard issue. `` Unfortunately, this crucial admission came several days late, and was made only after the level of passions had reached the highest degree,'' Pravda said. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said failure to promptly acknowledge what was done `` led to fantastic rumors and allegations which made people ... mistrust official reports.'' When asked at a briefing Wednesday whether nerve gas was used in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Gremitskikh </PERSON> replied that was impossible because it is a `` combat weapon.'' Six newly elected deputies to a national parliament asked Wednesday that better laws be developed to control troops and public officials so demonstrations do not repeatedly end in tragedy. The six returned from a visit to <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and included their findings in a letter to the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. They demanded that material gathered by investigators be turned over to the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies parliament when it meets for the first time next month. `` The absence of precise legal norms in the event of extreme situations creates unlimited possibilities for the taking of arbitrary, uncontrollable decisions, which can have unpredictable consequences,'' their letter warned. They scolded officials for refusing journalists access to <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> and accused them of covering up the soldiers' use of shovels as weapons and of gas. Foreign reporters have been barred from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> since the clash. Almost 5,000 civilian volunteers now patrol the streets of <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> and maintain order in place of departing troops, media reports said. Reports from the Georgian capital said no serious incidents followed lifting of the curfew there Tuesday morning. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said streets were patrolled by members of a public order squad wearing red arm bands, and more police than usual were on the streets.

 The state will pay for Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s libel suit against <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> for publishing accusations by a Greek fugitive banker that <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> received millions of dollars in payoffs, a government spokesman said Wednesday. Spokesman <PERSON> Sotiris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostopoulos </PERSON> said at his daily news briefing that <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> sued the American newsmagazine `` as premier of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> ... so all expenses incurred by this suit will be paid by the Greek state, which will be reimbursed from the damages received from the positive outcome of the trial.'' <PERSON> Kostopoulos </PERSON> confirmed that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boudin </PERSON> already has been paid $ 100,000 through the <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to handle the suit. He did not disclose how much money <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> seeks in damages. <PERSON> Boudin </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Monday that the suit was brought against <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> because in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> he need show only that the story written about <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> was libelous and damaged his reputation, without regard to whether he is a public figure. Time ran an interview with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>, former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION>, in its March 13 issue. <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON> alleged that <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> and senior members of his governing party, the <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> PASOK </ORGANIZATION>, received millions of dollars in payoffs in return for political favors. Time officials said attempts were made to obtain <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s and the government's side of the story before it was published, but they were rebuffed <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> days after he fled <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> in November. He was arrested and jailed in <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, where he has granted interviews to the media. He awaits hearing on a Greek petition for his extradition. The $ 200 million embezzlement scandal at the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION> has been front page news in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> since it broke last October. Eight ministers resigned and eight PASOK-appointed officials from state enterprises were accused of accepting `` stolen money'' from the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION> and were imprisoned. <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>' bodyguards told investigators they personally delivered cartons stuffed with tens of thousands of dollars to a close friend of the premier's. At an earlier news briefing this month, spokesman <PERSON> Kostopoulos </PERSON> branded <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON> a `` swindler'' who had connections with high-ranking <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials and alleged that they were behind the scandal. He echoed <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s repeated charges that foreign decision-making centers initiated the campaign to undermine <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and smear the premier's name.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a group of congressional leaders Wednesday that he has n't decision on future development of the MX nuclear missile, the legislators said. `` He's indicated he's working on the MX issue and he's anxious to receive the input from a wide variety of individuals on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>. `` He did not in any way strike a note of finality. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> and other legislators said they did n't know whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would support building a mobile version of the MX, would back the smaller Midgetman missile, or some combination of the two. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> discussed the issue with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> members of both parties. He convened the group, along with his top foreign policy advisers, in what he intends to use as an occasional chance to consult with them on general foreign policy, his staff said. The missile question is part of an effort to build new weapons for the land-based leg of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear arsenal. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s options are to base new 10-warhead MX missiles on rail cars, a system favored by <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> generals, or develop a new single-warhead missile known as the Midgetman, to be housed on trucks. The Midgetman is far more costly, with a price tag of nearly $ 24 billion for 500 single-warhead missiles, compared to $ 5.4 billion for the same capability on the multi-warhead MX, according to <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> estimates. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> currently has 50 MX missiles based in silos in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, in addition to the multi-warhead Minuteman missiles.

 Housing Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> on Wednesday eased away from a commitment by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to replace expiring housing subsidy certificates with vouchers. While not announcing a policy reversal, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> was looking `` for some way to take the best characteristics of the Section 8 certificate and the voucher and marry them.'' `` I do n't want to be the secretary of vouchers. I really, strongly believe we need housing and economic development and vouchers are a tool to give people a choice,'' said <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s comments came in an apppearance before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> on <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> and independent agencies where he presented the agency's 1990 budget request a day after the full committee voted to add $ 153 million under the McKinney Homeless Assistance Act to the agency's 1989 budget. department's 1990 budget request. Replacement of certificates with vouchers originated with former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1990 budget proposal and was retained in the revisions <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in February. About 1 million low-income households receive rental assistance subsidies through the two programs. Subsidies in the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> section 8 certificate are based on the difference between 30 percent of a family's adjusted monthly income and actual rent, which can not exceed the fair market rent for the area in which the family lives. Beginning in 1989, subsidies for 780,000 certificates will expire over a 12-year period. A recent study by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, concluded that `` with <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s 1989 budget request, about 9,500 or 6 percent fewer families can be assisted with vouchers than with certificates.'' The report also said it would cost an additional $ 208 million to assist the same number of families with vouchers. `` They are ... more expensive than the certificate, but the purpose was not to compete against the certificate. The purpose was to give choice, ... give people a chance to upgrade,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> told the panel. But he said he was open to looking at a mix of both as a part of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s housing subsidy program. `` I'd also like to have somebody think of how we can take a voucher or a certificate and have an element in there that would give people some equity, some chance of maybe using it as a potential for making a down payment someday,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> added. `` I commend Secretary <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> for taking a fresh look at this issue. The recent <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report showed that the housing voucher program has n't lived up to expectations. I stand ready to work with Secretary <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> to develop a program that will provide moderate-income pepole with the housing they need and at a price we can afford,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulski </PERSON>, D-Md., chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee that had requested the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> study

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday approved a record $ 157 billion bailout and reform bill for the savings and loan industry after toughening provisions that would require S & amp; L owners to put more of their own money at risk to stay in business. The 564-page bill was approved on a 91-8 vote two months after President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called for emergency legislation to stop the hemorrhaging of the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L insurance fund from the failure of 500 thrifts, more than 200 of them in 1988, and another 350 at or near insolvency. The legislation reprsents the biggest government financial rescue in history, dwarfing five times over the combined costs of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> bailouts of the 1970s and early 1980s. The administration praised the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s action, particularly after it rejected an alternative financing scheme to put the immediate $ 50 billion taxpayer share of the bailout on this year's budget and create the potential for the biggest federal deficit in the nation's history `` The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> deserves a great deal of credit for acting swiftly,'' said Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. `` In fending off amendments to the financing mechanism, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has upheld the integrity of the Gramm-Rudman -LRB- deficit reduction -RRB- process. We also applaud the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to maintain strong capital requirements.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan avoids swelling the budget deficit by creating a new quasi-government corporation to issue $ 50 billion in 30-year bonds. The savings and loan industry will pay off the principle on the bonds but tax dollars will be used to pay virtually all of the $ 4 billion to $ 6 billion annual interest costs. Democrats had contended those interest costs could be reduced $ 150 million a year or by a total of $ 4.5 billion over the 30-year life of the bonds through direct borrowing by the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Similar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L legislation is moving through the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> but at a slower pace. Final congressional action is expected before July. Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, had threatened to delay passage and force the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to cut short its 11-day recess for Passover if it did not adopt a tougher capital standard and mandate that banks and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls provide a series of free and low-cost consumer services. After lengthy negotiations, members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> agreed to make S & amp; Ls have at least 1.5 percent so-called `` tangible'' capital in relation to their total loans that could be seized in the future before federal insurance funds are tapped to pay off depositors in failed thrifts. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal would have required S & amp; Ls to double their capital-loan ratio from the currently required 3 percent to 6 percent by 1991. But it would have allowed thrifts to meet the new requirements entirely through the use of an accounting technique that allows non-money `` good will'' as capital. The new 1.5 percent requirement for `` tangible'' capital _ cash, stocks and property that could easily be converted to cash _ also was adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s financial institutions subcommittee last week. But the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel weakened other capital requirements in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal, according to consumer group critics. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., promised <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> speedy hearings and efforts to write bills to address changes in banking laws sought largely by consumer groups Among them are measures that would require banks and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls to cash all government checks, provide low-income people with low-cost checking and publish data on their lending for improving low-income neigborhoods and loans to minorities. `` It is n't all that I would like in the bill, but we've come to an understanding,'' <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> said just before the vote. The bill tracks the proposal presented in February by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, pledging $ 157 billion over the next 10 years _ two-thirds of it from taxpayers _ to cover depositors against losses and calling for widescale reforms. Chief among them was that S & amp; L owners be required to effectively double their own investment to remain in business. Because many operators of failed S & amp; Ls had little of their own money at risk, they had little incentive to refrain from making risky loans using federally insured deposits, according to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The package includes money to pay for some $ 38 billion committed last year to close or subsidize the mergers of more than 200 S & amp; Ls, $ 50 billion to be spent over the next three years for rescuing 350 more institutions and $ 33 billion to handle new insolvencies expected to arise before the year 2000. To fulfill <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s promise of `` never again,'' the legislation also effectively replaces the agency that oversees federally insured thrift institutions, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which has been widely criticized as being too close to the industry, with a new regulatory authority to be established under the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The S & amp; L deposit insurance program would be transferred to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which now guarantees bank deposits. Both programs guarantee depositors against losses up to $ 100,000 each. And the legislation establishes a new agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, to dispose of some $ 400 billion in real estate and other property that is falling into the government's hands through defaults on bad loans made by failed S & amp; Ls. The package also increases from $ 10,000 a day to $ 1 million a day the possible fines for <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L operators convicted of fraud, which has been cited by government auditors as the single biggest contributor to the crisis, and provides $ 50 million to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to pursue criminal charges. Earlier Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected on a 61-38 vote an effort aimed at the bank board's chairman, <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, who has been widely criticized as minimizing the escalation of S & amp; L problems last year. Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., complained that <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>'s reassuring comments, as late as one month before the presidential election in November, amounted to `` an intravenous shot of morphine that would have numbed anyone to the crisis. Wall was an aide to Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, the banking committee's ranking Republican and former chairman, for 17 years before assuming the top <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L regulatory post in July 1987. The administration and <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> want to guarantee Wall the right to serve out his term through June 1991. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> would have required <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to reappoint him, forcing a likely confirmation fight with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. On passage of the bill by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, all the no votes were cast by Democrats: Sens. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>.

 Under the bright lights of a tent often used for basketball games in this seaside town, about 1,700 Jewish emigres celebrated their first Passover outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. For many who could not learn the rudiments of their faith in their officially atheist homeland, the ceremony Wednesday was the first real experience the holiday commemorating the release of the ancient Israelites from bondage in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. The emigres, who await visas for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or other countries, were guided through the service by Rabbi <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabiski </PERSON>, who emigrated from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> 15 years ago and now ministers to the estimated 4,000 Jews in <LOCATION> Ladispoli </LOCATION>. He carefully explained in Russian the significance of the Passover meal, the seder, and introduced the rituals. The refugees, at small tables with their families, listened politely and some whispered questions to neighbors. `` This is all so difficult to take in,'' said a doctor from <PERSON> Baky </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> province who identified herself only as <PERSON> Yana </PERSON>. She said she felt overwhelmed by so much knowledge about a faith she had always identified with but had not learned well. The seder was paid for and organized by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distribution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which cares for the emigres from arrival in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> through the transfer to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, the main <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visa processing point, to their departure weeks or months later. It gives them money, provides information about life in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> and teaches the customs and history of the Jews. Many of the emigres living in holiday accommodations at <LOCATION> Ladispoli </LOCATION>, a seaside resort 25 miles from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rabiski </PERSON> said Wednesday night the Passover at <LOCATION> Ladispoli </LOCATION> was particularly poignant because those who attended were in flight like the Israelites from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a representative of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distribution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said many of the emigres had attended lectures about the ceremony and helped set up tables in the tent, which often is used for basketball games.

 A retired librarian convicted of shooting six people to death and trying to kill 24 others in a 1987 shopping center rampage deserves the death penalty, a jury recommended Wednesday. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON>, 61, sat hunched over the defense table and showed no emotion as the recommendation was read to Circuit Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Antoon </PERSON> after 1 -LCB- hours of deliberations. <PERSON> Antoon </PERSON>, who is not bound by the recommendation but said he would give it great weight, set sentencing for July 28. The jury, which could have recommended a life prison sentence instead of death, convicted <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> on April 5 of 32 counts of murder, attempted murder and kidnapping. The rampage occurred on April 23, 1987 at two shopping centers in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s east coast. The dead included two policemen. `` <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> declared war on the community of <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>,'' State Attorney <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfinger </PERSON> said after Wednesday's decision. `` The jury verdicts were very appropriate.'' Jury foreman <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said a videotape of <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON>'s police interrogation strongly influenced the 12-member panel's decision. Juror <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said, `` We all felt the same. He knew what he was doing.'' Defense attorneys refused to comment. They had contended <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> was insane at the time of the slayings. In closing arguments earlier Wednesday, State Attorney <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfinger </PERSON> ridiculed the insanity defense. `` Evidence has shown that this defendant has forfeited his right to live on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>,'' the prosecutor said. `` He is a cold, calculating killer. He deserves to die.'' <PERSON> Wolfinger </PERSON> held up a shotgun and a semiautomatic assault rifle used in the rampage. He pumped the shotgun several times and popped an ammunition clip into the rifle repeatedly. `` He was going to kill as many people ... as he could,'' he said. Despite evidence of mental illness, <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> showed he was in total control of his faculties when he methodially tracked down his victims and shot at them repeatedly, some as they lay wounded and moaning on the ground, <PERSON> Wolfinger </PERSON> said. Assistant Public Defender <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Arlt </PERSON> argued that the rampage would never have happened if <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> had not been suffering from mental or emotional disturbance. `` Mr. <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> that day was a bubbling cauldron'' that finally exploded, <PERSON> Arlt </PERSON> said in his closing argument.

 Well-wishers flooded a hospital with stuffed animals and other gifts Wednesday for a 5-year-old girl who lost her hand when a pipe bomb concealed in a toothpaste dispenser exploded at a K mart. <PERSON> Erin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bower </PERSON> lost her left hand and may recover only partial sight in her left eye, <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> physicians said. <PERSON> Erin </PERSON>, who was shopping with her parents at the K mart Monday night, was holding the pump-type toothpaste dispenser when it blew up. Her condition was upgraded Wednesday from serious to fair, and she was moved from the pediatric intensive care unit to a children's room, hospital spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said. `` That's really good news,'' <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said. `` She's taken some 7-Up and apple juice and her mood is quiet.'' `` She's in a lot of pain, so I'm not sure how much hassunk in at this point,'' said hospital social worker <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. `` A lot of the questions -LRB- about the explosion -RRB- have n't come yet.'' The hospital has received a flood of balloons, plants and stuffed animals and hundreds of calls expressing sympathy for <PERSON> Erin </PERSON> and her parents, who have another daughter. `` The first thing they say is, ` This was so horrible, I just wanted to let the parents know I'm praying for them,''' said Mrs. <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. The bombing makes people feel `` so vulnerable, like this could happen to anybody,'' she said. `` A nice family goes to K mart and their life changes forever.'' A trust fund for paying <PERSON> Erin </PERSON>'s medical expenses was set up at the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> branch where her 31-year-old mother, <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON>, is manager. `` People are dropping off checks and cash,'' said bank Assistant Manager <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandy </PERSON>. `` Everyone is concerned for the well-being of <PERSON> Erin </PERSON>.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON> was slightly injured by shrapnel from the bomb. No one else was hurt. Investigators have received more than 200 phone calls from people who think they can identify two men wanted for questioning who are depicted in composite sketches circulated by the <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's department. The men, both believed to be about 20 years old, drew police attention because they were seen nonchalantly leaving the store immediately after the explosion as other people reacted to the blast. Authorities have been contacted by former <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> residents from as far away as <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, said detective Sgt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Kouns </PERSON> of the sheriff's department. `` I've got more information than I know what to do with,'' <PERSON> Kouns </PERSON> said. Police and two agents from the federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> spent Wednesday cross-checking names reported by callers. <PERSON> Kouns </PERSON> said the bombing could have stemmed from a vendetta against a K mart employee or the store itself, or may have been a random attack. K mart offered up to $ 5,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible, but sheriff's department spokesman <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Minier </PERSON> said store officials would be urged to raise the reward to at least $ 10,000 `` because of the senselessness of the crime. Several <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> radio stations urged listeners to contribute to reward funds. K mart spokeswoman <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kota </PERSON> at the chain's Troy, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, headquarters, said company officials had not discussed raising the reward.

 The USS <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> was steaming for <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> hours after a gun turret explosion and fire Wednesday that killed 47 sailors, trailed by the <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, an aircraft carrier with full medical facilities. No damage could be seen from a chartered jet. <PERSON> Svend </PERSON> <PERSON> Ovesen </PERSON>, the pilot, said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had told aircraft to stay 25 miles from the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, but we moved in close for a better view. Our plane approached at 500 mph, then <PERSON> Ovesen </PERSON> lowered the landing gear and circled the battleship at 130 mph. Two jets took off from the USS Coral Sea, but there was no effort to interfere with us. The explosion in one of the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s three turrets occurred during a gunnery exercise 330 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. By 4 p.m. EST, the 887-foot vessel was 205 miles north of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, heading south toward the island's <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roads </ORGANIZATION> naval base. Whitecaps dotted the calm blue of the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. Three other <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships besides the Coral Sea could be seen in the area. At an altitude of 500 feet and an equal distance from the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, no signs of exterior damage could be seen and no one appeared to be on deck. In two forward turrets, the guns pointed off to the right, but the three 16-inch guns of the rear turret were pointed straight astern. `` Those turrets normally should be pointing straight when they're not being fired,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomlinson </PERSON> of Bholke Int. Airways, owner of the plane, who accompanied the reporter and <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON>, a photographer for the daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuevo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dia </ORGANIZATION>. `` Their being in all different directions like that, off to one side, means something's wrong,'' said <PERSON> Tomlinson </PERSON>, a former Marine. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials said the explosion occurred in the second of the two forward turrets, which normally is manned by 27 sailors but can hold 60 or 70. A huge <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag is painted on the top surface of the turret.

The du Maurier style, vivid and gothic, made for spine-chilling films like <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON>'s `` The Birds,'' from her short story, and <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Roeg </PERSON>'s `` Do n't Look Now,'' from her novella. <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Daphne </PERSON>, as she was known after being honored by Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, died in her sleep, said her friend and legal executor, <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker-Munton </PERSON>. Until about two weeks ago, she had been fit enough for daily walks with her dog around Par, the <PERSON> Cornish </PERSON> village where she had lived in widowed seclusion for 20 years. <PERSON> Daphne </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Maurier </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on May 13, 1907, one of three daughters of the renowned actor Sir <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Maurier </PERSON>. Educated by private tutors in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, she was 21 when she published her first articles and short stories. Her first novel, `` The Loving Spirit,'' appeared in 1931. The novel captivated a young British army major and led to a storybook courtship. The officer, <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> `` Boy'' <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>, resolved to meet the young woman and journeyed to Par to find her. They met in 1932 and married a few months later. `` It was rather woman's magazine-y,'' she remarked afterward. In the same year she published her second novel, `` I'll Never be Young Again.'' `` <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inn </LOCATION>,'' a big seller, followed in 1936, and then came `` <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON>.'' `` <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON>,'' about a young bride whose probing into the death of her husband's previous wife leads her into a frightening psychological labyrinth, was published in 1938 and sold 1 million copies in hard cover alone. It was reprinted 39 times, launched <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>'s movie career opposite <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON>, and was translated worldwide. She became <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> with the ennoblement of her husband, who had been commander of British Airborne Forces in World War II and then treasurer to Prince <PERSON> Philip </PERSON>, husband of Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. In 1943, they rented Menabilly, the rambling, often fog-shrouded Georgian manor which had inspired <LOCATION> Manderley </LOCATION>, the fire-doomed mansion in `` <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Cromwell </PERSON>'s troops gutted the house during the English Civil War, and legend had it that a cavalier was bricked up alive in one of Menabilly's gray stone buttresses. The writer's hideaway was a gardener's hut, where, she said, `` I'd sit for hours on end, chain-smoking, chewing mints and tapping away at my typewriter.'' She would prowl the grounds of Menabilly or answer stacks of fan mail when not at work on her writing. Her husband died in 1965. In 1969, <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Daphne </PERSON>, as she had become that year, moved from <LOCATION> Menabilly </LOCATION> to Par with her two <ORGANIZATION> Yorkshire </ORGANIZATION> terriers and rented another mansion, <LOCATION> Kilmarth </LOCATION>. `` It is rather like death to have to leave,'' she said. Despite her wealth, she never owned a home. At <LOCATION> Kilmarth </LOCATION> she wrote `` The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on the Strand.'' Her last novel was `` Rule Britannia,'' published in 1972. `` Growing Pains,'' a memoir of her early years, appeared in 1981, and her introduction to a new book on <LOCATION> Cornwall </LOCATION> will appear in the fall. Although always cheerful and kind to friends, she preferred a secluded life. `` I ca n't say I really like people,'' she once remarked. `` Perhaps that's why I always preferred to create my own instead of mixing with real ones.'' She waited until age 64 before consenting to be interviewed on TV. <PERSON> Baker-Munton </PERSON> said she would be cremated later this week at a private ceremony with no flowers and only family friends, her son and two daughters, in accordance with her wishes.

<TEXT>
 Soldiers toppled a major <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> rebel stronghold and killed more than 600 of the insurgents during a two-month government offensive near the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border, a government spokesman said Wednesday. In <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, a grenade exploded Wednesday outside the home of an opposition leader, injuring two teen-agers, witnesses said. At a news conference, Col. Than <PERSON> Tun </PERSON> said 177 government soldiers, including some officers, were killed and 377 were wounded in the battle for the <LOCATION> Maela </LOCATION> camp. The bodies of 466 guerrillas were counted but he said more than 600 were killed during the offensive. <LOCATION> Maela </LOCATION>, near the Thai border, was regarded as one of the two major <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> strongholds. The other, <PERSON> Maw </PERSON> <PERSON> Poh </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>, fell to government forces March 26. The colonel claimed the government victory broke the backbone of the Karen insurgency, which began in 1949, a year after <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> achieved independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Thai police officers and Karens who fled the base also reported its seizure but gave much lower casualty figures. The Karens said Wednesday about 40 camp defenders were killed, including 10 students who joined the rebels after fleeing last year's government crackdown on the student-led protests for democracy. They said 180 to 200 government troops were killed. The base is 135 miles northeast of the capital, <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. Than <PERSON> Tun </PERSON> said government forces fought 66 major engagements with the rebels since operations against <LOCATION> Maela </LOCATION> began Feb. 18. The Karens, an ethnic minority, charged the government has reneged on promises of greater regional autonomy. The Karens are allied with nine other guerrilla groups in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which claims to field 35,000 fighters and control half the country. In <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, a hand grenade exploded 20 yards from the house of opposition leader <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, witnesses said. They said it injured two 16-year-old boys who found the grenade while playing in front of the house. The witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the explosion damaged the walls of a nearby house. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> was not at home at the time. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> was one of the original leaders of the leading opposition party, The National League For Democracy. But he was removed from the party when he asked another leader, <LOCATION> Aung </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Suu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kyi </LOCATION>, to expel communists from her faction. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> later formed his own party to contest an election that military authorities have promised to hold next year.

 <PERSON> Dominitchi </PERSON> <PERSON> Demeter </PERSON>, considered a king among Gypsies, died at a hospital where hundreds of his followers flocked upon hearing of his illness, police and hospital officials said. <PERSON> Demeter </PERSON>, 57, was admitted last week to the <ORGANIZATION> Mulhouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, suffering from cerebral congestion.

 A British tabloid, serializing the sex and scandal memoirs of a former call girl who later worked as a government researcher, printed a picture of her with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> in Thursday's editions. Early editions of the Daily Mail said the picture of <PERSON> Pamella </PERSON> <PERSON> Bordes </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat, now under investigation for alleged unethical conduct, was taken during a 1983 meeting in <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s office on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> tabloid, which bought the rights to Ms. <PERSON> Bordes </PERSON>' story, said at that time she was working for the Indian mystic and businessman <PERSON> Chandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Swami </PERSON> The meeting was arranged by the <LOCATION> Swami </LOCATION>, who had business connections in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the paper reported. `` Among the things discussed, according to those close to the <LOCATION> Swami </LOCATION>, was the possibility of obtaining a ` green card' permit for Pamella officially to become an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> resident,'' the newspaper said. `` Unknown to <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, this was at a time when she was, in her own words, working as ` sex bait' for the Swami's international business deals. At the meeting, the <LOCATION> Swami </LOCATION> presented Mr. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> with some ceremonial gifts and pleaded with him to help <PERSON> Pamella </PERSON>. `` His -LRB- <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s -RRB- staff sent a copy of this picture to <PERSON> Pamella </PERSON> signed with his best wishes.'' The newspaper said a spokesman for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said the office remembered the meeting with <PERSON> Swami </PERSON>'s group but `` did not recall doing anything to help her obtain a green card.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has denied charges by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that he violated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules in 69 instances involving an unusual book publishing deal and his benefits from a business partnership. The first installment of Ms. <PERSON> Bordes </PERSON>' memoirs printed in Wednesday's <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION> contained lurid tales of sex with financier <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON>, with a <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> prince and with a top aide to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> The Daily Mail quoted her as saying she was introduced to life as a jet-set call girl by <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON>, the Saudi billionaire arms dealer, whom she met in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in 1983. The Mail said it was sending all its material on Miss <PERSON> Bordes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> was arrested Tuesday in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> extradition request connected with allegations he helped hide assets belonging to deposed President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>.

The newspaper did not identify the prince further except to say he was a senior member of the ruling family.

She was quoted as saying she had sex with <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Diam </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>.

 A huge gun turret packed with gunpowder exploded in flames on the battleship USS Iowa near <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> on Wednesday, killing at least 47 sailors in one of the worst naval disasters since the Vietnam War. The death toll from the accident during a gunnery exercise, `` could go higher, but we do n't know at this point,'' said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>. The death count was taken from a list of sailors assigned to the position rather than a body count. The number of crewmen injured had not been determined, he said. Two ships participating in the same exercise collided Wednesday afternoon about 500 miles east of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, causing one minor injury, said <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> <PERSON> Galloway </PERSON>, a civilian public affairs officer at <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>. Neither the USS Platt, a fleet oiler, nor the frigate USS <PERSON> Tripp </PERSON> was in danger of sinking, <PERSON> Galloway </PERSON> said. The ships were not in the same area as the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. The explosion occurred in one of the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s three heavily armored turrets, each of which supports three of the ship's nine 16-inch guns. The turret was `` full of gunpowder,'' said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Baumann </PERSON>, another fleet spokesman. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> crewmen put out the fire in 80 minutes, flooded several magazine compartments holding explosives as a precaution and declared the ship out of danger, <PERSON> Baumann </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> rendezvoused at midafternoon with the nearby aircraft carrier USS Coral Sea, which carries three doctors and has full medical facilities, <PERSON> Baumann </PERSON> said. Helicopters from the <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> brought medical equipment to the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and transferred some injured crewmen to the carrier. `` The ship has not sent a list of the wounded. They have other things more pressing to worry about,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Grier </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> will arrive Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roads </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> base in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, said Cmdr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Franzmann </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>. The 46-year-old ship, one of the four largest in the fleet, is based at <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>. Burn victims from the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> were being evacuated to <ORGANIZATION> Brooke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> specialized burn unit in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, according to medical official in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials were notifying relatives personally of the deaths, <PERSON> Baumann </PERSON> said. Several family members gathered at a gymnasium in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> to await word. `` The longer we hear nothing, the better it is,'' said <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, a relative of crewman <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> The explosion occurred during a gunnery exercise about 330 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said. The ship's 16-inch guns can fire 2,700-pound shells a distance of 23 miles. The fire was in the second of the two forward turrets, at the loading position of the middle gun, said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Nason </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman at the Pentagon. There also is a turret at the back of the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Each turret is protected by armor that is 17 -LCB- inches thick. There was no sign of the accident visible during a flyover of the ship. A gun turret is normally occupied by 27 people, but can hold 60 or 70 people, <PERSON> Baumann </PERSON> said, but, `` We do n't know how many people were in there at the time.'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> who spent a week as a guest on the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> in 1987 and now is curator of the permanently docked USS <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Fall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, explained how a shell is loaded. After the shell is placed in the gun, a door is opened to the gun room from the powder hoist room, he said. Cylindrical powder bags, containing about 110 pounds of powder, are then rammed in behind the shell and what is called a breech plug is sealed to prevent the leakage of powder gases. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> said there were `` at least five'' stages in the firing process when the explosion could have occurred but would not speculate further. The training exercise to improve fleet readiness began April 13 and involved 19,000 people aboard 29 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships, three allied ships and shore-based aircraft, <PERSON> Baumann </PERSON> said. There were 1,600 people aboard the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, including Vice Adm. <PERSON> Jeremiah </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, commander of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 2nd Fleet. It was believed to be the worst loss of life involving a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ship since June 2, 1969, when the destroyer USS <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> collided with the Australian aircraft carrier <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, killing 74 people. An Iraqi missile attack on the USS Stark in May 1987 killed 37 crewmen and wounded 21. A similar explosion occurred in the center gun turret aboard the heavy cruiser USS Newport News during the Vietnam War in October 1972, killing 20 crewmen and injuring 36. `` It is a great tragedy and a matter of terrible sadness,'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` I will take this opportunity to express my regrets, especially to the families of the kids that were killed.'' In addition to its massive 16-inch guns, the 887-foot <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> is equipped with 12 five-inch guns and Tomahawk and Harpoon missiles. It was the model for three other Iowa-class battleships and is among the most heavily armored of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships. The <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and its sister ships, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, are the largest battleships ever built except for two Japanese ships of the World War II era, the <LOCATION> Yamato </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Musashi </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, in accordance with policy, would not confirm or deny whether the ship carried nuclear weapons. The <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> was built during World War II, mothballed until the Korean War, and mothballed again. It was modernized and reactivated in 1984, at a cost of $ 409 million, and returned home last year after service escorting Kuwaiti tankers in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> provided the following hot line numbers for people to call for information about relatives on the ship: inside <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>: 800-572-2126; outside <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>: 800-368-3202 or 800-523-2975.

 Seven students were arrested Wednesday after refusing to budge from a University of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> laboratory where they were protesting against Defense Department-funded research. Campus Director of Public Safety <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilson </PERSON> said the three women and four men were removed, and in some cases dragged, from the <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> laboratory, when they remained in the building after closing hours. He did not release their names, but said they were being booked on trespassing charges. The occupation, which started at 1 p.m., stemmed from a campus rally earlier in the day against such projects as the university's quest for an anthrax vaccine The university maintains the research focuses on a non-virulent strain and is for peaceful purposes, but students and members of the local chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> want the research moved off campus. `` It's kind of a leap to say basic research on the university campus is somehow directly supporting a war in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>,'' said university spokeswoman <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>. `` Our research here is all basic.

 The government has told airlines and travel agencies that beginning Friday all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens must have visas approved by the government to visit <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that each visa must be stamped by a <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> consul that recognizes the government of acting president <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>. The majority of Panamanian consulates do not recognize the <LOCATION> Solis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palma </LOCATION> government, continuing to recognize the government of President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who was ousted in February 1988. Previously, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens traveling to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> needed a tourist card, available at any Panamanian consulate.

For those who had husbands or sons in the area of the explosion, they are wondering, ` Was it my husband, my son?''' `` The longer we hear nothing, the better it is,'' said <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, a relative of crewman <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> policy requires that families of dead or injured sailors be notified before any list of victims is released to the news media, and not all families had been notified by mid-evening Wednesday, officials said. <PERSON> Brimhall </PERSON> was one of many <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> chaplains, social workers, and <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> personnel called in to deal with the families' grief. `` The first thing we did was establish a place for them to gather,'' said Master Chief <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinder </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` We provide a place for them to be. The chaplains, social workers, <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and others are there to help them in any way possible.'' `` Our primary purpose,'' <PERSON> Brimhall </PERSON> said, `` is to help them air their feelings, talk about their fears to reassure them, but be honest. Some are going to loose a loved one. It is a ministry of presence.'' The families were helping each other, <PERSON> Brimhall </PERSON> said. `` There is a lot of support within the group. I saw relationships develop right before my eyes as women put their arms around those who were having touble,'' he said. He described the mood in the gym as varied. `` There are those who are really struggling and those who are really stoic,'' he said. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Quagliotti </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brownton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said she and her husband had n't been able to reach <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials to find out about her son, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Quagliotti </PERSON>, a dentist on the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> `` I have no idea where our son could be,'' Ms. <PERSON> Quagliotti </PERSON> said. `` Anything is possible.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s contingency plan for such tragedies was worked out long before the accident, <PERSON> Kinder </PERSON> said. `` We take this very seriously. Family response crisis is a very major issue with us,'' he said. <PERSON> Kinder </PERSON> said the families are given updates at least every half hour, and more often as developments warrant. `` Right now, for some of these families, they would rather have bad news than no news at all,'' <PERSON> Brimhall </PERSON> said.

 About 2,000 Americans are hospitalized annually with a split wall in the body's major artery, an ailment that sent <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> into emergency heart surgery, a heart specialist said Wednesday. `` It's one of the most severely painful diseases a human has to suffer,'' although not everyone who gets an `` aortic dissection'' experiences extreme pain, said Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, chief of cardiac diseases at the National Heart, Lung and <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, Md. The condition, also called a `` dissecting aortic aneurysm,'' involves a tear that splits the wall of the aorta, the main artery connecting the heart to smaller arteries that carry blood throughout the body. Although 2,000 Americans reach hospitals and are diagnosed with a split aorta each year, an unknown number of others suffer the ailment and have it misdiagnosed as a heart attack or die before they arrive at an emergency room, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said during a telephone interview. He estimated aortic dissection kills about half of those it afflicts, often when the split aorta wall ruptures to cause internal hemorrhaging. Of those who reach hospitals and undergo surgery, about three-fourths survive hospitalization. Death is most likely during the operation itself, he added. The aorta emerges from the left ventricle _ the heart's main pumping chamber _ passes upward and arches over the top of the heart, then passes down behind the heart and into the abdomen. During aortic dissection, a tear suddenly develops in the tissue that makes up the wall of the aorta. The layers of tissue separate, allowing blood to flow into the gap, which then painfully expands like a balloon. The pressure can make the tear spread up or down a greater length of the artery. An aortic dissection is different than the much more common and conventional aortic aneurysm, in which the artery wall is weakened and balloons outward, but layers of the artery wall do n't split. `` In Miss <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>'s condition, the beginning portion of her aorta -LRB- near the heart -RRB- began to tear apart, and that tearing progressed all the way down into her abdomen,'' her surgeon, Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kass </PERSON>, said Tuesday night. The split wall `` involved essentially her whole aorta,'' he added. During the six-hour operation at <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kass </PERSON> said, he removed the 77-year-old Miss <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>'s ascending aorta _ the short stretch of aorta that emerges from the ventricle _ and the aortic valve. He replaced them with those taken from the cadaver of a 27-year-old. The aortic valve controls the flow of blood from the ventricle into the aorta. <PERSON> Kass </PERSON> said the expansion in Miss Ball's split artery wall `` unroofed the aortic valve'' to make it leak. A leaky valve can cause heart failure because blood ca n't be pumped out of the heart efficiently. During a news conference, <PERSON> Kass </PERSON> did n't explain why the rest of the aorta was n't replaced. But <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said many arteries branch off the aorta, so it's safest to replace only the part where the tear started A surgeon can `` tack'' together the place where the split wall continues, preventing ballooning by blocking blood from flowing into the gap, he said. <PERSON> Kass </PERSON> also said he detached the ends of Miss Ball's coronary arteries where they connected to her ascending aorta, then reattached them to the newly implanted aorta, restoring blood flow that nourishes the heart. Sometimes an aorta with a split wall is n't replaced, but is repaired with synthetic materials, such as by inserting a knitted Dacron tube inside the defective section of aorta. Doctors do n't know why aortic walls sometimes split. Hardening of the arteries and congenital artery weakness have been suspected. But the risk is increased by high blood pressure, which <PERSON> Kass </PERSON> said Miss Ball has suffered for several years.

 Police and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agents raided a remote ranch and seized 1,375 pounds of refined cocaine, the largest ever seized in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelbard </PERSON> said Wednesday. The cocaine was found Monday at a ranch 330 miles to the northeast of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>, near the town of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ramon </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> DEA agents involved in the seizure. Authorities said one person was apprehended during the raid, which was first disclosed Wednesday. `` This is far and away the largest single amount ever caught in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gelbard </PERSON> said in an interview. He said the amount _ more than double the cocaine seized in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> all last year _ indicated a capacity of producing refined cocaine much greater than previously estimated by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities. Bolivian police authorities believe the cocaine belonged to <PERSON> Carmelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, considered to be one of <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s biggest cocaine traffickers. A relative of <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> owned the ranch, officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> said a cocaine processing lab was found and destroyed at the same ranch in August. They said it apparently was awaiting shipment to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. The cocaine was seized during an operation involving 20 <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> narcotics police and <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents who flew to the jungle ranch on four <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> helicopters donated by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. Authorities said a ranch employee was being held for questioning at a police base in <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION>, about 250 miles northeast of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>. They said the cocaine was being held by authorities under the supervision of the attorney general's office, which is seeking a court order to burn it. During all of 1988, authorities seized 546 pounds of refined cocaine in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said.

<TEXT>
 A Soviet ship that can skim oil on the high seas joined the war against the nation's worst oil spill Wednesday, docking in a town named for the man who bought <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> for $ 7.2 million. The 11,400-ton Vaidogubsky, 425 feet long, steamed 30 miles up fjord-like Resurrection Bay under a cloudy sky, flying the Soviet hammer and sickle from its stern and an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag from its towering white superstructure. It tied up at a railroad dock, its decks strewn with heavy equipment, smoke spewing from its stacks. About 100 yards away, crews unloaded oil-soaked booms and absorbent material from the cleanup at <LOCATION> Nuka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, one of the most polluted sites on the southern coast of the <LOCATION> Kenai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. `` It's pretty impressive for a skimmer,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Petty Officer <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Safford </PERSON>, who snapped photos as the ship arrived a little before 8 a.m. `` It's huge.'' By midmorning, a stream of tourists were driving up to the dock to take pictures and wave to the crew. The ship came to <PERSON> Seward </PERSON> for refueling, and probably would be in port all day, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Roussel </PERSON>. The oil spilled March 24 by an <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> tanker is becoming very thick and difficult to deal with as it weathers, <PERSON> Roussel </PERSON> said. `` We do n't know how it -LRB- the Vaidogubsky -RRB- is going to work in the kind of oil we're skimming,'' he said. `` Our goal is to get in the oil. We'll probably use it in Resurrection Bay for awhile.'' The Vaidogubsky works with two motorboats that drag a boom to corral the oil. Then two pipes working like 100-foot straws dip into the oil and suck it onto the larger ship, said a Soviet crewman who spoke in halting English. The vessel is capable of gulping 200,000 gallons per hour, and has a storage capacity of 2 million gallons. If there's not enough oil there to justify its continued use, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> will move it `` to where the oil is. <PERSON> Nuka </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON> is our most likely plan,'' he said. The Vaidogubsky probably will be available for 30 days, <PERSON> Roussel </PERSON> said. It's unclear who will pay its fuel and operating costs, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> has promised to pay the costs of the total cleanup effort. The Soviets have had an interest in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s fisheries for more than a decade, with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fishing boats delivering cod and flounder to Soviet processing ships. Though the joint venture is expected to phase out over the next few years because of `` Americanization'' of the bottomfish catch, the Soviets received 176,000 tons last year and are expected to take less than 110,000 tons this year, said <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Larkins </PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, the Soviets' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> partner in the joint venture. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday that industry plans for dealing with an Alaskan oil spill had been a `` zero'' on a scale of one to 10, and one senator said the initial response to the March 24 disaster reminded him of `` the <ORGANIZATION> Keystone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kops </ORGANIZATION>.'' Sen. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., chairman of the environmental protection subcommittee, said the response to the spill has demonstrated `` a complete breakdown'' of the procedures that were supposed to have been in effect since the federal government approved the Alaskan pipeline 16 years ago <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, denied that his company has been slow in responding to the crisis, but acknowledged that the industry's preparedness was inadequate This type of accident was `` so highly unlikely that the consequences of it ... were viewed as acceptable,'' he told the subcommittee. <PERSON> Seward </PERSON> this week became the first town outside <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> to have oil wash up on a beach. `` If they -LRB- the Soviets -RRB- can capture oil out there and pick it up before it blows on shore, that's much to our advantage,'' <PERSON> Seward </PERSON> deputy city manager <PERSON> Darryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefermeyer </PERSON> said. `` Our goal is to get the oil picked up and not wait until it gets on beaches, and then have to clean beaches.'' The oil that washed ashore near <LOCATION> Seward </LOCATION> was a taffy-like goop mixed with seaweed, and was cleaned up Tuesday. But more oil was in Resurrection Bay, and still more reported on nearby islands and headlands of the <LOCATION> Kenai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, including at Kenai Fjords National Park. The oil has been streaming into the Gulf of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> where the tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> hit a reef and spilled 10.1 million gallons of North Slope crude oil. Skimming in the often stormy gulf has been hampered by high seas because small boats in operation can handle seas only to about 5 feet. Seas recently have run as high as 12 feet. Cleanup contingency planners did n't expect oil to get outside <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION>, which is largely protected from rough waves by a series of islands. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> has about 20 skimmers working in the sound and the gulf. Two operate out of <PERSON> Seward </PERSON>, `` and of course we have several booming operations involving a whole armada of fishing vessels,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwietniak </PERSON>. It was the second time in less than a year that a huge Soviet ship aided rescue efforts in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Last October the Soviet icebreaker <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Arseniev </PERSON> smashed its way through the frozen waters off Point Barrow to help free two <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whales trapped in the ice. <PERSON> Seward </PERSON> is named for former Secretary of State <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seward </PERSON>, the man who bought yet-unexplored <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> for $ 7.2 million in 1867. Doubters dubbed it `` Seward's Folly.''

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats apparently heeded an official warning and canceled seats on <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flights in the weeks before the bombing of Flight 103 last Dec. 21, according to airline documents quoted in a congressional memorandum. The House Government Operations transportation subcommittee staff memo says <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> documents indicate that Christmas holiday traffic for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy personnel had been heavily re-booked before the bombing over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, which killed 270 people. Relatives of those who died in the bombing have been angry that a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> warning of a possible bombing of a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was not made public. They say diplomats would have acted on the warnings and canceled <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flights. The subcommittee memo, made available to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, notes that <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> has denied that there were any threats aimed specifically at Flight 103 in the two weeks before the bombing. According to the memo, one of the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> documents, barely legible, says: `` Of course, we are telling pax -LRB- passengers -RRB- of <LOCATION> PA </LOCATION> security measures FRA -LRB- <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> -RRB-.'' Another document involves a request `` for public information guidelines in view that about 80 percent of holiday traffic of embassy is rebooking.'' But there is no further explanation of that statement, nor is there any indication that the rebookings specifically involved Flight 103. The statement does not say which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy is meant. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said there was `` no basis at all for the allegation that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> officials systematically canceled reservations on Flight 103 based on the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> aviation security bulletin.'' `` There is no evidence whatsoever of any systematic pattern of canceled reservations for this flight by anyone or any group,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. But when asked if she had any information on whether cancellations had occurred involving other flights, Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said she could not immediately answer that question. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Kriendler </PERSON>, vice president of corporate communications for <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, when asked if there had been large numbers of diplomats canceling flights on <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` There is no indication that that was the case.'' In <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, chairman of Victims of Flight 103, said, `` We knew that diplomats had information regarding the threats to <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103. We are outraged at the cover-up and apparent lies of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` We have felt from the beginning that government officials were informed of the terrorists' threats and were able to change their travel plans,'' said <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>. The subcommittee has asked <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> for all internal documents relating to security measures, to threats about Flight 103, and information about who in <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> knew about any such threats. Contents of the March 13 subcommittee memo were first reported by a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper, The Independent. The memo says <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> should be asked to provide details of lost revenue `` since <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> was obviously keeping track of threat-related cancellations.''' The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> warning was prepared after an anonymous caller to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> said a bomb attack would be made in the two weeks after Dec. 5. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> bulletin was sent to embassies so they could inform foreign governments. Since the bombing of the New York-bound <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the Finnish police have maintained that the telephoned warning was a hoax. Relatives of those who died on Flight 103 have maintained it was inevitable that diplomats would act on the bulletin, warning friends and relatives and canceling <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> reservations. On April 7, <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> McManaway </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador-at-large for counterterrorism, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>: `` That is not true.'' McManaway pointed out then that 31 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government personnel died in the bombing. He said the decision of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to post copies of the warning was not in accordance with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government policy.

 Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>'s longtime campaign treasurer has admitted taking some $ 500,000 from re-election bank accounts, the senator's spokesman said Wednesday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamee </PERSON> would n't say whether charges would be filed against accountant <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, who joined the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION>'s campaign staff in 1974. <PERSON> McNamee </PERSON> took depositions Wednesday from other workers in the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> Democrat's office here Wednesday. `` We just had a meeting where they presented their evidence,'' <PERSON> McNamee </PERSON> said. In a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Maynes </PERSON>, <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>'s press secretary, said <PERSON> Karlsen </PERSON> promised to pay back the money which he admitted to taking. `` But I think that to repay implies an ability that I do not know is there,'' <PERSON> Maynes </PERSON> said. `` He said he would do everything he could to make restitution, and he does have some financial resources.'' He said <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> was saddened by what he viewed as betrayal by an insider. <PERSON> Karlsen </PERSON> has an unlisted phone number and could not be reached for comment. <PERSON> Maynes </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION> resident was still in the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> area, but had `` left town'' April 10, leaving behind a note that he did n't plan to return. `` He changed his mind and came back to the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> area Sunday, and he called Monday and admitted that he had done this,'' <PERSON> Maynes </PERSON> said. He said it was n't known how much money was missing. `` We're in the process of trying to reconstruct the events,'' <PERSON> Maynes </PERSON> said. The funds apparently were withdrawn from certificate-of-deposit accounts after they had been recorded, <PERSON> Maynes </PERSON> said. The first thefts took place about 1981, he said. Since then, <PERSON> Karlsen </PERSON> has been divorced twice and had a series of business reversals through his <ORGANIZATION> Karlsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Karlsen </PERSON> firm, <PERSON> Maynes </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Karlsen </PERSON> has been treasurer for several other Democrats, including <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON>, who ran unsuccessfully for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat, and Gov. Rose Mofford. Mofford campaign finance committee Chairwoman <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said <PERSON> Karlsen </PERSON> resigned last week. She said no money was missing from the governor's coffers. State Board of Accountancy records show <PERSON> Karlsen </PERSON> was certified as a public accountant in 1972. Two years later, he met <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> and became treasurer in time to help in <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>'s successful 1976 campaign. A survey by the Common Cause organization showed <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> had a $ 502,000 campaign surplus as of Dec. 31.

 Two jurors and an alternate juror in the Iran-Contra trial of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> did not tell the truth when they said they had never been involved in court proceedings, <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> news </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. The three could be disqualified, the network reported on `` World News Tonight'' on the eve of jury deliberations in the trial of the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide.

One juror answered `` no'' even though he was sued for $ 100,000 in 1981 as a result of an auto accident, and another juror said `` no'' even though she was sued in 1982 for $ 50,000 following a car crash, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said. Both lawsuits were settled but constitute court proceedings anyway, according to <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. If <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> decided to disqualify either or both jurors, the first alternate would be named to take their place. That juror also answered `` no'' to the question but, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said a computer check at <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> showed that the alternate was arrested twice on drug charges and was put on probation for a year. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> was told of the findings but declined to comment, the network said. North, a former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel, was a major figure in the Iran-Contra scandal. He is charged with 12 criminal counts. The charges include lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the attorney general, illegally converting traveler's checks to his own use and conspiring to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> through a tax scam to support the Contra rebels fighting the Nicaraguan government.

 A federal judge sentenced a <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> man to 15 days in jail and fined him $ 20,000 Tuesday for cutting down 138 trees on a national park near his home to get a view of the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. `` It is true that the area can be restored, but only with great expense of time and resources, so a message must be sent to others,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said while sentencing <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON>. `` That message, gentlemen, is that one may forfeit his or her liberty.'' <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON>, 45, had the trees removed, then advertised his home has having a river view, the government said in its indictment. `` I was willing to settle this thing when I first talked to the parks department if they had n't insisted on branding me a criminal,'' <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON> said before sentencing. He was convicted earlier this year of destruction of government timber, a misdemeanor, and disposing of government property, a felony. He faced a maximum sentence of 11 years in prison and $ 350,000 in fines. Prosecutors recommended a $ 64,000 fine and a 60-day sentence. `` I think the court gave the sentence we recommended serious consideration and we are pleased with the sentence,'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. The 138 trees in the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> were valued at more than $ 30,000. King asked the judge to fine <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON> twice the replacement value of the trees as punishment. <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON>, president of a water bed manufacturing company in <PERSON> Jessup </PERSON>, and his wife, <PERSON> Jo </PERSON>, bought the house in 1982, the indictment said. In March 1985, despite discussions with <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials about what timber could be cut, <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON> hired a tree service company to cut down the trees, the goverment contended. <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON> and his wife later listed the house and four acres for sale, advertising it as having a river view, the indictment said. The house, which has not been sold, was assessed for tax purposes in 1986 at $ 381,510. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON> to concurrent three-year and six-month sentences, suspending all but 15 days of the three-year sentence and the entire six-month sentence. <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON> was also ordered to serve two years' probation upon his release and perform 300 hours of community service. <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON> is considering an appeal.

 Rising interest rates have caught up with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> homeowners and are pinching the pockets of the 12 million households with adjustable-rate mortgages. For many of them, springtime'89 means a second annual hike in mortgage payments _ 20 percent over a year ago on average _ since that's when the bulk of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> homes are usually sold and mortgages originated. This season also marks the first real test of interest-sensitive adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs as they're called, in an era of tightening credit. A government report issued earlier this week showed a 5.4 percent drop in housing starts last month, evidence that rising rates are already having a major impact on the economy.

<HEAD>Campaign Reform Knot: What's Fair?</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Since <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders agree, it seems unanimous: there ought to be a law reforming campaign finances to curb soaring costs and to create a fair, level playing field for House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates. The only trouble is that they can not agree on what's fair and what's level. Neither side can afford to be against reform of a system almost everyone believes is too expensive, too distracting and too subject to abuses. But the dominant Democrats are n't interested in legislating away the advantages of incumbents, and the minority Republicans want changes that could strengthen challengers. So they argue about what is and is n't reform. The most drastic of current proposals for campaign reform came from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in what was almost an aside as he called for a new ethics code for all federal officeholders. `` I believe we should eliminate contributions to candidates by political action committees, and I'll be consulting with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about that, and I also oppose federal funding of congressional campaigns,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Political action committees _ PACs _ are fund-raising groups organized among officers and other people associated with corporations, unions, interest groups and the like. The PACs raise money from their members and dole it out to candidates, mostly to incumbent senators and representatives. PACs sprang up and multiplied, in number and in dollars, because of the stringent campaign contribution limits imposed in the reform wave that followed Watergate. That's the trouble with reforms. As soon as they are devised, somebody invents a way around them, and sometimes the new reformed system is worse than the original problem. During the last campaign, political action committees reported contributions of more than $ 150 million to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates. Less than $ 19 million of that went to candidates running against incumbent members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Because there are more Democratic incumbents, nearly two-thirds of the PAC money went to Democrats. Republicans were particularly incensed that in the past few elections, their ideological allies from business PACs poured money into Democratic incumbents' campaigns and generally stiffed <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> challengers Political action committees can give a candidate up to $ 5,000 for each election, primary or general. They also can spend money independently in support of a candidate. Individuals are limited to $ 1,000 contributions to a candidate for each election. Republicans do better at party fund raising from individual donors. Neither party has a monopoly on fat cats, but the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> has done a better job of cultivating the wealthy, encouraging them to go to the maximum for the national party, its campaign committees and for individual candidates. Those numbers point to the politics behind <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal for a flat ban on PAC contributions. `` Modern democratic government works best when organized by strong political parties and yet we have allowed our parties to become weakened and overshadowed by special interests, and we can best restore the role of the parties by limiting political action committees,'' he said. `` PACs weaken the parties, restrain competition and deaden the political debate.'' The president's proposal would limit the PACs right out of business, since they exist to make campaign contributions. Other Republican proposals would limit the size of <ORGANIZATION> PAC </ORGANIZATION> contributions as well as raise the limits on individual donations. Either formula would work to the advantage of candidates challenging incumbents _ which usually means Republicans in House elections, where the Democrats have an 86-seat margin. In the last elections, more than 98 percent of incumbent congressional candidates won new terms. Democratic leaders want legislation that would set voluntary ceilings for congressional campaign spending, with a cap on <ORGANIZATION> PAC </ORGANIZATION> contributions as part of the formula. Their reform plan includes the public financing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rejects. `` He ran for president on public financing,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>. `` If it's good for presidential campaigns, why is it so bad for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaigns?'' Senate Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> said what the Democrats want `` boils down to an incumbency protection plan,'' with ceilings that would keep a challenger from spending what it takes to offset the incumbent's advantages. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> says the Republican goal is a setup that will preserve their advantage in raising money from well-heeled individual contributors. They're right.

<HEAD>MTV Network's Weak Sibling VH-1 Gets Boost, Microprogrammed To Baby
Boomers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 VH-1, once a poorly defined cable network that believed what people over 30 wanted was <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Iglesias </PERSON> music videos, has finally found itself, as members of its baby boom audience might say. VH-1's parent <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Networks </ORGANIZATION>, which also has the big-time <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nickelodeon </ORGANIZATION> cable channels, has in recent months boosted VH-1's staff and budget and given VH-1 chief <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> his own pipeline to network president and chief executive officer <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Freston </PERSON> The developments at VH-1 are what network television has most to fear about cable: an entire broadcast agenda microprogrammed to one very lucrative audience. While the networks take snatches of the age 25 to 49 audience with shows like `` thirtysomething,'' `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>,'' `` The Wonder Years,'' and `` <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> Law,'' they also have to reach viewers who were unconscious from 1960 to 1980. Just watch `` Nightingales.'' VH-1, its parent <ORGANIZATION> MTVN </ORGANIZATION> hopes, is for everyone who stayed awake during those years. `` We feel this is a great chance to target the audience that grew up on television and contemporary music,'' <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> said in a recent interview. The new VH-1 programming includes interview segments, clips of classic and contemporary rock and pop, `` infotainment'' reporting on show business, and special attention to weekends, when VH-1 watchers are more apt to set aside their graph charts and tune in. The theme weekends have included interviews, clips and concert films devoted to <PERSON> Elton </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> and others. <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> also acknowledged the challenge of reaching an audience that includes <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans, former peace marchers, sociologists who became investment bankers and business majors who operate halfway houses. `` A network that is targeted to fit this generation has to know how it lives,'' he said `` We want to create an environment that keeps people up on contemporary music, but also reflects their past; has comedy about current events, but also is nostalgic.'' To keep both ends of the candle burning, VH-1 is sponsoring a `` Million Dollar Baby'' contest for the offspring of baby boomers and offers a series of Earth Alerts _ celebrity-hosted informational spots keyed to the activities of the Greenpeace organization. The `` Million Dollar Baby,'' sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Gerber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and Downy fabric softener, harkens back to the corporate-sponsored contests of the 1950s. Entrants send in a photo of their offspring from ages four months to 2 -LCB- years, with an April 24 deadline looming. The winner will be announced May 8. The prize is a zero coupon municipal bond, worth $ 1 million at maturity. The Earth Alerts are tied in with a celebrity fund-raiser album, `` Rainbow Warrior,'' due this month on Geffen Records. `` Environmental issues are still the issues of this generation,'' said VH-1 spokeswoman <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Kornbluth </PERSON>. `` At the farthest end, there is not much we can do to shock this audience,'' said <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>. `` This audience did a lot of crazy things back in the 1960s and 1970s ... we ca n't take ourselves too seriously.'' One of VH1's best efforts to catch the spin of its viewers recently failed with the cancellation of the `` Watch <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON>'' interview show. Rivers remains with the network as a host, and he is typical of the exuberant, insightful personality VH-1 is seeking for its audience. The 35-year-old <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> grew up in the <LOCATION> Willowbrook </LOCATION> neighborhood of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Verbum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> _ where he was president of the library club _ and <ORGANIZATION> Marquette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He's a bookish, energetic personality who came to VH-1 from WPIX-TV in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and before that was an interviewer for the syndicated `` PM Magazine. His first exposure to the power of television was the Watts Riots in August of 1965, just a few blocks from his home. `` We were all in the living room watching the riot on TV, and it looked like all of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> was going up,'' <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> said. `` But no, it really was just a very small community. But from what was on TV, people in <LOCATION> Redondo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> -LRB- a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb -RRB- were ready to pack up and leave town.''

<HEAD>Passover Liberation Seen Mirrored In Exodus Of Soviet Jews</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A modern parallel is unfolding of the ancient Passover story of liberation _ the rising exodus of Jews permitted by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The resemblances were cited as the week-long Passover observance started Wednesday evening, marking the Jewish flight from bondage in <LOCATION> Egupt </LOCATION>. However, Jews today do n't have to rely on rituals of the past, says <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellenoff </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` Before our very eyes, the gates of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have been thrown open, and Jews are using the opportunity to stream out.'' During the first three months of this year, 9,461 Jews have been allowed to emigrate from the Soviet, triple the number in the same period last year, with projections the 1989 total may reach 40,000. That would be the third year of a steadily rising surge of departures under the more open policies of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shoshana </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardin </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Soviet Jewry, applauds the increased emigrations and improvements in religious and cultural rights of Soviet Jews, but adds: `` Our priority this Passover remains our often voiced demand, ` Let our people go.' `` We will not be silent until every Jew who wishes to emigrate is free to do so, until every <PERSON> Jew </PERSON> who wishes to remain in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is allowed full cultural and religious rights.'' The demand, `` Let my people go,'' originally was flung by the ancient Jewish leader <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> at the Egyptian Pharaoh in the world's earliest struggle for religious freedom nearly 4,000 years ago `` Those words still are relevant,'' says <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Strober </PERSON>, information officer of the <ORGANIZATION> NCSJ </ORGANIZATION>. `` Pharaoh has begun to loosen up and we welcome it. But we must remain ever vigilant.'' Moderating conditions for Soviet Jews, however, were seen as similar to the Jewish deliverance from oppression in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, the Passover event which has become a universal symbol of human liberation. As in the case of the ancient Israelites, the troubles were n't over for Soviet Jews after being let out of the country About 7,000 of them are stranded at a center near <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, most of them wanting to come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but exceeding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> quotas or refused <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> refugee status as fleeing persecution. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> accepts all wishing to go there, but the logjam has persisted, with efforts being made in this country to modify the restrictions. In the light of the ancient liberation from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ellenoff </PERSON> said, `` It is no surprise that the new mass emigration of Soviet Jewry has raised new perplexities. `` Our Bible teaches that physical emancipation is just the beginning of a long, painstaking redemptive process. We read that the freed Israelites complained bitterly to <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> about the hardships of freedom. `` When they had been slaves, the masters had taken care of their basic needs in return for obedient subservience. Only now, with emancipation, did the Israelites have to worry about food, water and protection from armed attack.'' While more Jews are being allowed to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the situation for those still there has moderated. Added facilities are being provided, and the <ORGANIZATION> NCSJ </ORGANIZATION> says all 15 Jewish prisoners of concience have been released. <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s Park Avenue synagogue for the second successive year airlifed Passover supplies to Soviet Jewish congregations in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Odessa </LOCATION> _ two tons of matzoth, wine, gefilte fish and other kosher foods for Passover. Rabbi <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneier </PERSON>, leader of the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> congregation and head of the <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conscience </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, recently negotiated the return to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Choral Synagogue of an adjoining building for a community center. He said the center, when refurbished through funding by the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> synagogue, would provide a lecture hall, meeting rooms and classrooms for Jewish adult education, courses in Bible, Jewish history and Hebrew and a kosher restaurant. Soviet Jews are celebrating Passover with a new haggadah _ recounting <PERSON> God </PERSON>'s deliverances _ in <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hebrew </LOCATION>, published by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Choral Synagogue with help of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture. The Soviet's Jewish population has been estimated at about 2 million, and how many want to leave is uncertain. The <ORGANIZATION> NCSJ </ORGANIZATION> says that several years ago it estimated the figure at more than 300,000, but it now may be less. Questions remain about various aspects of the situation, <PERSON> Ellenoff </PERSON> says, and the answers may not come quickly. `` After all,'' he adds, `` it took 40 years for the emancipated Israelites to reach the promised land.''

<HEAD>New Names in the Money-Fund Game</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Two of the biggest names in the mutual fund industry have created new money market funds boasting yields that beat all their older competitors. They are getting an enthusiastic response from savers and investors scrambling after the high returns available in short-term money market investments. But experts on mutual fund investing urge that you look beyond the current yield figures these funds sport before you decide whether they suit your purposes. In figures compiled early this month by <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s Moneyletter, the Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar Money Market Fund and the <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spartan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Money </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> ran neck and neck for the No. 1 spot with seven-day yields of 10.4 percent. The average yield of 542 taxable money funds, by contrast, was 9.08 percent. How can Dreyfus and <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> do this? Well, for one thing, their timing was fortuitous. Since the new funds were organized in a period when interest rates were climbing, they were able to stock their portfolios with the latest high-yielding securities the marketplace had to offer. Older funds, by contrast, could accumulate new, higher-yielding securities only gradually as their assets increased and existing investments in their portfolios matured. More to the point, however, is a marketing strategem that has been used many times before when a new fund is introduced: Dreyfus and <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> are temporarily paying the funds' expenses and waiving their management fees. `` It's smart to take advantage of these situations, but watch these funds closely,'' says <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> in his newsletter The No-Load Fund Investor. `` They can stop waiving expenses without notice and their yield advantages will disappear.'' The charges <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION> is n't collecting effectively increase the Worldwide Dollar fund's yield by 0.7 of a percentage point, notes <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fosback </PERSON>, editor of the newsletter Income & amp; Safety, while the difference at <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spartan </ORGANIZATION> is 0.6 of a point. `` Frankly, we are ambivalent regarding this promotional technique,'' <PERSON> Fosback </PERSON> says. `` The upside is that such funds offer adroit investors an opportunity _ albeit brief _ to earn far-above-average returns. The downside is that savers seeking these opportunities may end up with their money in a fund whose performance may prove to be below average in the long run. `` Of course, there is nothing to prevent you from withdrawing from a fund once the fee waiver and expense assumption ends, but the funds are counting on many investors being too poorly informed or lazy to move their money out.'' Even after they have stopped waiving fees and expenses, it's possible that the Worldwide Dollar and <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spartan </ORGANIZATION> funds will do well <PERSON> Fosback </PERSON> says the Worldwide Dollar fund, with a somewhat different investment policy, can be expected to outperform by at least a small margin its huge sister fund, Dreyfus Liquid Assets. <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, says the Spartan Fund will continue to carry lower fees and expenses than the long-established <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cash </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserves </ORGANIZATION> fund, in part because <LOCATION> Spartan </LOCATION> shareholders will pay separate charges for services offered `` free'' to investors in most other money funds. For example, Spartan holders pay $ 2 apiece for checks to write against their accounts, and the fund has a $ 5 redemption fee. Logically, then, <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> Spartan would seem to appeal to savers and investors who use a mutual fund as a long-term savings account rather than as a tool in a busy program of money management. For people who take such a long-term perspective, financial advisers agree, the latest seven-day or 30-day yield figure at a given money fund is n't of overriding importance. What matters is how well the fund is managed in all types of economic environments. As <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s Moneyletter advises, `` Make sure your fund is a consistent performer.''

<HEAD>Privatization Alive And Well _ Abroad</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Back in the mid-1970s when <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Poole </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was developing the notion of private enterprise being able to do government's work better than government, he could hardly have foreseen one of the twists that ensued. The concept seemed to thrive in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Organizations were formed to promote it. It was embraced by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. New laws encouraged private initiative. The White House named a director of privatization. But while the concept thrived domestically, action did not always follow. Surprisingly, much of the privatization developed abroad, in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, and incredibly, in the big-government communist world. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Poole </PERSON> has continued to develop his ideas, mainly through the <ORGANIZATION> Reason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, an organization he founded in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and which he still runs. Each year it publishes a progress report on privatization. The latest, just issued, reports that governments around the world continue to shift functions and responsibilities to the private sector, to the extent of $ 43 billion of sales in 1988 alone. That amount brought the worldwide cumulative total to $ 160 billion in just five years, and in almost every instance the basic notion was the same, that private initiative could result in more efficient management and services. In 1988, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> relieved itself of an obligation and fattened its treasury by selling <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> to private investors. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> sold off <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Telegraph for the same reasons. The Third World, struggling to survive in a more competitive world market, recognized the possibilities. <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> issued a decree that will result in the sale of 67 companies, including 12 banks. <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> plans to sell the government pension fund, and has already sold $ 1 billion in state firms since 1985. Asset sales tell only part of the story. Increasingly popular are Build-Operate-Transfer agreements whereby a private company agrees to build and operate a public facility for the government for a set time period. B-O-Ts are being used to build a major power plant and rail transit system in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, a new harbor tunnel in <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, and power plants in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. And, in of all places, a 181-mile tollway in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Surprising? Not really. Privatization is being widely embraced by nations that once felt it was the function of government to operate all enterprises. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has joined <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in allowing farmers to lease land from the state and buy their own trucks, tractors and equipment. Both have begun programs allowing individuals to buy houses and apartments from the state. Several communist countries are permitting private buusinesses to start up. Hundreds of co-ops were begun in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1988. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has gone further, with 23,000 co-ops authorized, each allowed to hire 50 workers per shift. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> now permits private companies employing up to 500 workers. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is in the process of breaking up of many collective farms and the leasing farm land to individuals, families and small groups. The report states that one-fifth of the country's 50,000 farms have been leasing land and equipment to individuals and families over the past two years In contrast to these efforts _ all of which promote the belief that private initiative results in more efficient production and delivery of goods and services _ is the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which the report states `` is virtually alone in having no serious national commitment to privatization.'' During the entire eight years of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, it states, the only large federal enterprise to be sold off was <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION>. There was additional action, but hardly enough to support the rhetoric. During 1988 the government reached an agreement to sell the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gasification </LOCATION> plant for $ 600 million over 21 years. And $ 4.6 billion was realized from the sale of federal loan assets in 1987 and 1988. A presidential commission has recommended using various form of privatization, including contracting jobs rather than doing them in-house, the direct sales of assets and other means to alleviate budget pressures. And a <ORGANIZATION> Reason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> task force recommends the privatization of <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION> and other power facilities, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service and the nation's airports and air traffic control centers. Will it happen? The lack of momentum suggests it wo n't occur for a long while. While President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said repeatedly he supports the concept, privatization advocates fear the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> effort is being downgraded. What an oddity, say those who support privatization: The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which symbolizes private initiative and taught it to much of the world, is now showing less initiative than some Third World and communist nations.

<HEAD>Minister Says Recognizing UFOs Could Boost Biblical Faith</HEAD>
<HEAD>With Laserphoto</HEAD>

 Smile indulgently about it if so inclined. That's OK with the Rev. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Downing </PERSON>. But he firmly maintains that UFOs are real and that they have key religious significance. He says recognizing the existence and operations of these Unidentified Flying Objects could do much to strengthen faith and renew confidence in biblical accounts. `` It would establish scientific plausiblity for the whole biblical field,'' he says. `` It would reinforce faith and make it possible in a scientific context.'' Downing, a Presbyterian pastor with a scientific bent, says government equivocation has caused skepticism about UFOs and so he expects some scoffing at his views. `` You have to have a good humor about it,'' he said in an interview. `` I ca n't prove I'm right, but there's lots of evidence for it, and until it wins out, some people are just going to have to laugh.'' He theorizes that activities of UFO-borne `` higher beings'' or `` angels,'' likely from another dimension rather than other planets, are indicated in biblical events ranging from guiding the Israelites from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s ascension. He said postulating such activities in forming biblical faith would open a middle ground between fundamentalist literalism and liberal theology's `` demythologizing'' of supernatural events as only symbolic. `` It would cut down the distance between liberals and fundamentalists, and serve as a mediating force between the two extremes,'' he said. `` The mythological concepts would have to be re-examined, which would be important for the liberal wing. The conservative wing, which stresses certainty and wants everything locked up tight, also would be impacted. `` This would mean unlocking things.'' Downing, 50, an <LOCATION> Endwell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, pastor, has a B.A. in physics and, after completing <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> Theological Seminary, got a doctorate at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edinburgh </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> on relations of science and religion. He details his ideas about UFOs and about eternity as a coexisting universe, based on <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>'s relativity theory, in a new paperback edition of his book, `` The Bible and Flying Saucers,'' issued by Berkely Books. `` What is clear through the biblical material is that God's will for the Jews, and eventually for all mankind, was ` revealed' by beings from another world,'' he writes. `` Usually these beings looked very much like ordinary human beings -LRB- they almost never have wings -RRB- ... Once the ` package' of biblical religion had been delivered, man became responsible for the distribution of the contents ...'' Downing said a hovering, UFO-like `` cloud'' by day, and glowing `` pillar of fire'' by night guided the Israelites out of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, projecting some propulsive force that parted the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, leading them for years across the desert. Other events he sees as carried out by UFOs include: The fire-like phenomenon on <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> in which <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> received the Ten Commandments, the Prophet <PERSON> Elijah </PERSON> taken to heaven in a fiery chariot, the star of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, the engulfing light of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' transfiguration, his being `` lifted up'' at his ascension and the blinding visitation of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> en route to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> `` All these were UFO types of reports,'' Downing said. Downing, pastor for 22 years of <PERSON> Endwell </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Northminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, also is theological consultant to the Mutual UFO network, based in <LOCATION> Seguin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and Fund for <ORGANIZATION> UFO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Recalling a 1969 government commission finding that <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> observations offered `` insufficience evidence'' to substantiate UFOs, <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> said the government was `` covering up'' and the full report never was released. He displayed a 1975 letter from then-Sen. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>, R.-Ariz., saying the material was being withheld as `` above Top Secret `` If the government were n't lying in denying UFOs exist, we'd have had a religious revolution starting 40 years ago,'' <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> said `` It would not mean undermining biblical faith, but reinterpreting it in light of UFO phenomena.'' In the pulpit, Downing said he rarely brings his UFO ideas into sermons, recognizing the controversial aspects, although members are aware of his interest in the subject. He added: `` Three or four have said they've had UFO experiences.''

<HEAD>China Facing Worst Energy Crisis in Decades</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Xinghua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clothing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Factory </ORGANIZATION> has abandoned plans to buy new machines from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> because it does n't have the electricity to run them. `` Without the right connections it would take years to get approval for the extra power,'' said <PERSON> Man </PERSON> <PERSON> Ying </PERSON>, energy manager at the 250-employee factory in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The factory also ca n't buy air conditioners for the sweltering summers and this past winter went days without heat because of a lack of coal. `` We send out special teams to look for coal,'' she said, adding that they sometimes must pay free market sellers and profiteers up to 130 yuan -LRB- $ 35 -RRB- a ton for it, three times the state-set rate. <PERSON> Xinghua </PERSON> is forced to shut down once a six-day week, every Friday, in the midst of the worst energy crisis in Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 40-year history. But it is more fortunate than factories in the key industrial cities of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Shenyang </LOCATION>, which operate only three or four days of their usual six-day week. In parts of <LOCATION> Jiangsu </LOCATION> province, another industrial center near <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, up to a third of the factories were closed and 40 percent of the power plants had stopped working at the end of the year because of coal shortages. In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, 500 factories employing 100,000 now operate only on night shifts because they have no power during the day. Not only factories are affected. In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, a city of 10 million people, elevators in high-rise buildings do n't work, new color televisions sit idle and people stock up on candles. The official Guangming Daily noted that even the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> has been ordered to shut off all electrical appliances every Thursday. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has been losing an average 200 billion yuan -LRB- $ 54 billion -RRB- a year during the 1980s due to power cuts. Last year the losses were believed to be double that as up to one-third of production capacity was unused. The crisis reflects the inability of energy production to match the nation's explosive industrial growth. Industrial output increased by more than 20 percent in 1988, but production of coal, used for 70 percent of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s energy, was up only 4 percent. Energy supplies have also failed to cope with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s new-found prosperity which has resulted in a surge of demand for televisions, refrigerators, microwaves and other electrical appliances. In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> last year, energy consumption by households jumped 29 percent, while power supply was up by only 3 percent. The Guangming Daily noted that one large luxury hotel in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> today consumes as much energy as all of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> did in the early 1950s. Another problem is that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, although the world's largest producer of coal with 970 million tons last year, ca n't get the power to the places it is needed. Most of the nation's coal is mined in the north, but industry is centered mainly along the southern coast. Half the country's badly overtaxed railway system and a third of river transport is devoted to carrying coal, but that still was n't enough. Last year about 8 million tons, or 3.5 percent of the state coal supply quota, was not delivered. According to a report in the weekly publication Outlook -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Liaowang </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, one large coal mine in <LOCATION> Shanxi </LOCATION> province, in the heart of coal country, had to stop operations temporarily because it lacked fuel to run its bulldozers. Low investment in energy industries, inefficient small mines and artificially low state-set prices for energy have widened the gap between supply and demand. Profiteering by officials with access to coal supplies _ even in the army _ is pandemic. Coal should sell for the state-price equivalent of $ 8 to $ 11 a ton but it goes for $ 54 to $ 80 after passing through the hands of various middlemen on its way to <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>. The government is considering various possible solutions, including more investment in energy production, higher taxes for energy use and higher energy prices, to achieve what appears to be an impossible goal of producing 1.5 billion tons of coal by the year 2000. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> now has no nuclear power but is building two plants along the southern coast and has plans for others. As a stopgap measure, the government is hoping that its harsh austerity campaign begun last fall will slow the economy down enough to relieve the energy crisis. `` If we consider energy to be the lifeblood of modern society,'' the Guangming Daily said, `` today's <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> can be compared to a patient suffering from anemia.''

<TEXT>
 How different <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first 100 days are from <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s. No battering of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s ways by a charismatic Californian. No outsider's hand on the helm, setting the government on its sharpest course change since the New Deal. These 100 days have brought only modest course corrections by a captain long used to walking the deck of the ship of state. `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> came in as an ideologue. He came up in politics that way, as a crusader,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sundquist </PERSON>, senior fellow emeritus in governmental studies at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has no crusade to carry out. It has n't been a very dramatic hundred days.'' No, it has n't. By April 29, 1981, the 100th day of his presidency, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was on his way to full recovery after the attempt on his life and was making it ever more clear that his energies were devoted not to the question of whether there would be budget and tax cuts, but to how deeply he could slash. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON>, who handled relations with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first months in office, says the assassination attempt and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s devotion to the themes of his campaign _ shaking up the ways government raises and spends money, steering the economy out of its doldrums and strengthening the nation's defenses _ determined the tenor of that first 100 days. Of the assassination attempt, <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON> says: `` The way he handled it _ with humor and dignity and class and with good grace _ struck a very responsive chord in the American public. I think it continued the honeymoon and helped the process of making <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> larger than life.'' Of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s priorities, <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON>, who later became <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s chief of staff, pointed to the significance of the decision `` that it is much better to communicate two or three major priorities rather than setting up 40 or 50 priorities `` There was a lot of arguing back and forth, but we had a game plan and a strategy and we stuck to it.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, on the other hand, has divided his energies among a number of initiatives: _ He gave <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> a plan to bail out and reform the savings and loan industry Congressional committees have made significant changes. _ He and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> agreed to a nearly $ 28 billion deficit-reduction plan that leaves the hard choices about cutting federal red ink for the future _ He secured congressional agreement to continue non-military aid to the Contras, but agreed to halt the aid in November unless four committees allow it to continue _ He submitted a $ 441 million education package It has been met with little enthusiasm. For much of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first 100 days, however, the overriding issue in his dealings with the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was his nomination of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> as defense secretary. After a bruising confirmation battle, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected the former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator 53-47 on March 9. It was the first time in 30 years that a president's nomination to his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> had been turned down. Opinions differ on whether the Tower defeat will impair <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s dealings with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or whether he repaired the damage with his swift and popular second choice of <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, one of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' `` The whole town seems to have put the Tower thing behind us, and I did n't think we would ever do that,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Korologos </PERSON>, veteran <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lobbyist who handled congressional relations for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> transition team. `` I think it was a minor blip when we look back at it,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a senior fellow at the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Hoover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, who was <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first domestic policy adviser. On the other hand, <PERSON> Bayard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Catron </PERSON>, a professor of public administration at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washinton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and an expert on government ethics, said, `` It really did hurt the administration. It detracted from everything else they were doing at the time.'' And a Republican strategist who spoke on condition he not be identified said, `` I think it demonstrated a vulnerability which people will tuck away for later on.'' <PERSON> Korologos </PERSON>, contrasting <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s entry into office with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s, said, `` It was a lot different because we had to show everything that -LRB- former President -RRB- <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> was n't.'' As for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, he said, `` They were just chipping away at the edges and trying to make course corrections a little bit, so it was a whole lot different operation.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, from a slightly different perspective, said, `` The worse the situation is when you take over as a new president, the easier it is to look good. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has a much more difficult problem. Given the different situation <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> inherited and what he is working with, the politics of it, he is doing as well on an equivalent basis.'' <PERSON> Sundquist </PERSON>, on the other hand, said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` had no particular program that he outlined in his campaign, and he has n't announced one since ... <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is simply carrying on, playing around the edges.'' Not only have <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> faced different situations, they are different types of people. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, another <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> chief of staff, described his boss' role in shaping the economic recovery package this way in his book, `` For the Record'': `` The president himself had very little to do with the invention and the implementation of the policies and mechanisms ... He was content to exercise the symbolic powers of his office _ and his astonishing skill in doing so was of course the very thing that made success possible.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, on the other hand, is a veteran of the nuts and bolts of government. `` He's got a managerial interest, which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> never had,'' said <PERSON> Catron </PERSON>, the professor of public administration. Another difference was highlighted by the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> strategist who spoke on the condition of anonymity: `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> always tried to make a headline every day or get on the network news, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seems not to be particularly concerned about it.'' Administration officials have told reporters they do n't think the 100-day yardstick, first applied in the administration of <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, is applicable to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Korologos </PERSON> agreed, saying that <ORGANIZATION> FDR </ORGANIZATION>, taking office in the depths of the Depression, `` had to do it in 100 days.'' `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does n't have to do it in 100 days. He's got four years to do it.'' <PERSON> Sundquist </PERSON>, however, cautioned that `` anything the president wants to get done in his term usually has to be done within the first year, which means it has to be under way within the first few months. `` Whether it is 100 days or 180 days is a minor point, but very little happens in the second, third and fourth years of any president's term. So the honeymoon period has to be used for important initiatives, and it has not been in this case.''

 The shuttle Atlantis is set to soar into space Friday to rekindle an American planetary exploration program that has languished for a decade because of budget cuts and the Challenger accident. The cargo is the <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> spacecraft which has a radar system powerful enough to pierce the dense sulfuric acid clouds of <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> and map its surface. The mission costs $ 550 million and the radar images could reveal much about the history of <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> and the evolution of our own Earth. Liftoff is scheduled for 2:24 p.m. Friday, and six hours later, Atlantis' five astronauts are to release <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> on the start of a 466-day outward journey to the mysterious planet. No American planetary spacecraft has been launched since the Pioneer-Venus probe in 1978, and <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> will be the first planet-bound vehicle to be dispatched from the space shuttle. When the 7,000-pound payload reaches <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> in August 1990, it is to fire into orbit and start its 243-day mapping assignment. `` The goal is to obtain radar images of at least 70 percent of the planet,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> project scientist at <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. He said the images could help scientists understand how <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> was formed and might provide an answer to the puzzling question of how <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>, evolved so differently even though at the beginning of the solar system they were almost identical. At the <LOCATION> Venusian </LOCATION> surface, the temperature is 900 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than that on Earth. <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> pictures might answer questions about the extent of volcanic activity and settle disputes over whether <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> once had oceans of water and whether it has shifting crustal plates similar to those on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. The radar is designed to produce images showing features as small as 150 yards across. In comparison, the 1978 Pioneer-Venus probe could not distinguish features smaller than 60 miles across. <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> is the first of two planetary craft scheduled for launching from Atlantis this year. The Galileo probe to <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION> is to set forth in October. The two spacecraft have been in development for more than a decade. They initially were delayed by budget cuts resulting from a slowdown in the space program after the completion of the Apollo man-to-the-moon program. They finally were assigned to shuttle missions set for liftoff in 1986. But those flights were derailed after Challenger exploded in January 1986, grounding the shuttle fleet for nearly three years. `` It's been a long time coming,'' <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> said. The first manmade spacecraft to probe another planet was <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>'s Venera 1, which scouted <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> in 1961. In the years that followed, a parade of these vehicles, each more sophisticated than the last, pushed deep into the solar system to take the pulse of our planetary neighbors. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has successfully sent five probes to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>, six to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>, four to <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>, three to <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION>, and one each to Mercury and Uranus. And in August, the long-traveling Voyager 2 is to take the first closeup look at <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has sent 19 successful spacecraft to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> and nine to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. Its most recent and most ambitious probes both failed _ <ORGANIZATION> Phobos </ORGANIZATION> 1 last September while en route to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Phobos </ORGANIZATION> 2 as it was starting its exploration from Martian orbit last month. Soviet engineers have not perfected the long-term nuclear-powered batteries needed to travel to the outer planets. The Soviet craft employ solar panels which draw electrical power from the sun. But at distant Saturn, Jupiter, <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> and Uranus, these panels would be too far from the sun to be effective. At their destinations, some of these robot marvels skim close, snapping pictures and gathering a few days of data before soaring on to another planet or into interstellar space; some orbit their targets to examine them at length, and some descend to the surface. What they collect is flashed as binary bits to Earth-bound computers, which translate the unknown into recognizable places filled with surprises and secrets. Vague speculations of the past have been replaced by solid scientific findings. Humans have caught their first views and hints of the great storm systems and rings of Jupiter; the active volcanoes on its salt-covered moon, Io; the parched and cratered wasteland of Mercury; ancient river bottoms, raging winds and an inactive volcanoe almost 80,000 feet high on Mars; sulfuric acid clouds, lightning and the hellish temperatures on <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>; the thousand rings and tantalizing moons of <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION>; a scalding 6,000-mile deep ocean beneath the cloudtops of Uranus. From these flights, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> is assembling a vast mosaic about the solar system and its intricate workings. A basic goal is to learn more about planet <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, fitting it into the cosmic puzzle that is the origin, the evolution and the structure of the universe. Some astronomers believe, for example, that Mars may today represent an earlier evolutionary state of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> when its atmosphere was being formed, and that <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> may represent what might happen to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> if its surface temperature were to rise significantly.

 The latest discoveries come from a far-off realm, Uranus, relayed by <ORGANIZATION> Voyager </ORGANIZATION> 2, a marvelous machine launched along with <ORGANIZATION> Voyager </ORGANIZATION> 1 in 1977 to probe Jupiter and Saturn. Voyager 2 was working so well after exploring Saturn that <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> reprogrammed it to sail past Uranus in 1986 and <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> next August. Uranus is considered the oddball of the solar system because, unlike the other planets, it lies tipped on its side with its north and south poles alternately facing the sun. Voyager 2 found that Uranus' magnetic field does not follow the usual north-south axis and instead is tilted 60 degrees and offset at the center. Astronomers believe it might have been knocked off course by an ancient collision with another celestial object. Voyager 2 found that winds on Uranus whip up to 450 mph and blow from the west instead of the east as previously suspected. About 5,000 miles below the planet's cloudtops, the spacecraft detected evidence of a boiling ocean of water and dissolved ammonia some 6,000 miles deep. Beneath this ocean, it is believed there is an Earth-size molten core of heavier materials. The spacecraft discovered 10 new moons orbiting Uranus, ranging from 24 to 102 miles in diameter, much smaller than the planet's previously recorded five satellites Uranus was thought to have nine rings; Voyager found 11. In contrast to <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION>'s rings, which are composed of bright grain-sized particles, Uranus' rings are made up of dark boulder-sized chunks. The Voyagers also discovered a ring around Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system and a valuable astronomical laboratory because of the diversity of its system of at least 16 moons. During the flyby encounters, the Voyagers and the earlier <ORGANIZATION> Pioneers </ORGANIZATION> 10 and 11, found Jupiter to be a whirling ball of liquid hydrogen, topped by a uniquely colorful atmosphere which is mostly hydrogen and helium. They learned the Great Red Spot, observed for centuries through Earth-based telescopes, is a tremendous atmospheric storm similar to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s hurricanes. The space probes detected lightning in Jupiter's upper atmosphere and observed auroral emissions like <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s northern lights in the Jovian polar regions. Jupiter spins at a dizzying pace _ once every 9 hours, 55 minutes, 30 seconds _ but it takes the massive planet almost 12 Earth years to complete a journey around the sun. Before Pioneer 11 and the Voyagers passed by <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION>, astronomers knew the planet only as a fuzzy yellow sphere surrounded by six rings. The startling images relayed back quickly identified several thousand rings made up of small ice particles orbiting the planet at various speeds. The spacecraft discovered five new Saturnian moons, raising the total to 17. Titan, the largest, received the most attention because it is the only moon in the solar system believed to have an atmosphere. Although it is inconceivable that life could exist in the oceans of liquid nitrogen and freezing hydrocarbons believed to form Titan's surface, scientists are intrigued by the possibility that the giant moon may hold clues about the formation of organic molecules in the atmosphere of the primeval Earth between three and four billion years ago. The Voyagers also found <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere of hydrogen and helium alive with monster storms, with winds of 1,100 mph. <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>, our sister planet and closest neighbor, more nearly resembles <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> in size, physical composition and density than any of the other planets. However, Mariner and <PERSON> Pioneer </PERSON> probes found that <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> is a blistering hot world where the 900-degree heat is trapped in a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide. Radar peering through <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>' thick cloud cover found evidence of two major active volcano areas. The concentration of lightning over these areas suggests frequent eruptions. A valley may have been created by tension in the planet's crust pulling the surface apart like similar processes on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Photographs taken of Mercury by <ORGANIZATION> Mariner </ORGANIZATION> 10 in 1974 and 1975 revealed an ancient, heavily cratered surface, closely resembling our own moon. The pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing the planet. Instruments aboard <ORGANIZATION> Mariner </ORGANIZATION> 10 found that Mercury has a weak magnetic field and a trace of an atmosphere - a trillionth the density of the Earth's and composed chiefly of argon, neon and helium. The spacecraft reported temperatures ranging from 950 degrees Fahrenheit on the sunlight side to 346 degrees below zero on the shadowed side. Of all the planets, <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> has long been considered the solar system's prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life. But the results obtained by the Viking 1 and 2 landers in 1976 and 1977 were teasingly inconclusive. Small samples of Martian soil were scooped up and specially treated in three different experiments designed to detect biological processes. While some of the tests indicated biological processes were occuring, the same results could be explained by the planet's chemistry. There was no evidence of organic molecules in the small areas surveyed by the <ORGANIZATION> Vikings </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Vikings </ORGANIZATION> and earlier <ORGANIZATION> Mariners </ORGANIZATION> found that dust covers the Martian surface under a sparse atmosphere that allows the wind to stir up fierce summer storms. Massive active volcanoes dot the landscape, and dry sinuous channels, perhaps carved long ago by flowing water, stretch for hundreds of miles. Many scientists believe water still lies below the surface, giving rise to speculation that some form of life might yet be found there.

 <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilbourne </PERSON> says she believes her character in `` Midnight Caller,'' the wealthy owner of the radio station that employs provocative talk show host <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Killian </PERSON>, probably asked her father for a radio station when she turned 21. `` A big point is made that she did n't just kick back and say I'm playing with radio,'' <PERSON> Kilbourne </PERSON> said `` It was an ailing station and she turned it around.'' The series plots bring station owner <PERSON> Devon </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> into regular conflict with <PERSON> Killian </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> -RRB-, a former <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> detective whose late-night show turns him into an urban hero. `` I think she and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> are friends,'' <PERSON> Kilbourne </PERSON> said. `` I like the relationship because it's not burdened with sexual tensions. There is a mutual attraction. I think the writers are trying to have these people's vision widened by the other's point of view. There's a real friendship developing between the characters. I like that.'' The one-hour series, filmed on location in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, has been doing well in the ratings and consistently wins its time slot. `` I got the role by auditioning for it, which is a very painful process,'' <PERSON> Kilbourne </PERSON> said on a visit to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` I was interviewing for another job and forgot about the appointment with the producers of ` Midnight Caller.' My agent called and said I'd be late. `` I raced over, preoccupied with the other show, and read directly off the page. They said thank you. I got into my car and banged my head on the steering wheel. I marched into my agent's office to tell her never to schedule me like that again She said they'd called and wanted to test me.'' <PERSON> Kilbourne </PERSON> was born into the motion picture business, but her mother whisked her out of town as soon as possible. `` My mother did n't want to have anything to do with <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` Her father had written ` The Wizard of Oz.' I grew up in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> LaCanada </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. I had a very normal childhood.'' <PERSON> Kilbourne </PERSON>'s grandfather was <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Langley </PERSON>, one of the screenwriters who adapted the <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baum </PERSON> fantasy for the 1939 classic motion picture. `` My mother was looking for stability. She's an artist, and while she appreciates the creative aspects of the business, she wanted to provide a stable environment for her children. She had grown up in boarding schools in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>.'' Despite her mother's aversion to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kilbourne </PERSON> began studying drama when her mother married an actor involved with the Shakespeare Festival. She began studying with the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> Repertory Theater, then enrolled at <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. `` During that time I rediscovered my love of acting,'' she said. `` It had been a bit of a conflict because my family was academically oriented and I was studying political science. It was a time when I could have gone either way. I dropped out of college and pursued acting full-time.'' Once she turned professional things moved swiftly. `` I do n't remember having a time when I could say I can rest now,'' she said. `` I do n't think it's in my personality to sit back. I'm very critical and demanding of myself. Every time I see my work I say I'm better than I was a year ago, but I've got a long way to go.'' Her first professional film role was two lines in an episode of `` The Paper Chase.'' She was <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazzard </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> miniseries `` North and South.'' `` I was the Irish girl whose father was the doctor in the Mexican War,'' she said. `` <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchum </PERSON> played my father. That's when I meet <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazzard </PERSON> and we marry I worked very hard on the Irish accent. Everyone around me was speaking with a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> accent.'' She was in both parts of `` North and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>.'' Her screen romance and marriage to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazzard </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Reade </PERSON>, developed offscreen as well. They were married last October. `` Pretty Hollywood, huh?'' said <PERSON> Kilbourne </PERSON>. Her husband also has appeared in `` Beaches'' and `` Eight Men Out.'' <PERSON> Kilbourne </PERSON> also starred in `` Nothing in Common,'' a brief 1987 series. She has been a guest star in various series and starred in two TV movies, `` Calendar Girl Murders'' and `` Going To the Chapel.''

It recently agreed to extend by 10 years payments on the bulk of that debt, and accept partial principal payment as part of an agreement with other international banks. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> had placed a temporary moratorium on principal payments of bank debt in September 1985. The church groups had asked that <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, which remains the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commercial bank creditor of that country, to refuse to reschedule South African debt and make any new loans as long as the present political system remains intact. `` By extending this debt we're expressing a tolerance of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Tuesday at <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>'s annual shareholders meeting. `` We must make a moral judgment.'' <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said that while his company opposes <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s apartheid system `` debt forgiveness is a word you'll never hear from this bank. `` Our objective is simple and straightforward: We would like to be paid back. It's not a question of morals ... it's a question of business judgment,'' he explained. <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> shareholders also agreed, with 91.6 percent of them voting against a proposal to abandon debt rescheduling agreements with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, vs. 8.4 percent approving it. The remaining abstained. The shareholders also rejected a request by the church groups for <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> to end corresponent banking with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, in which it performs services for firms not having access to direct facilities. The vote was 89.2 percent opposed, 10.8 percent in agreement and the rest abstaining.

 <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Kapstein </PERSON> has been teaching long enough to know that kids are n't exactly wild about learning economics. So he came up with a novel way of presenting the often-dry curriculum: through the lyrics of rap music. <PERSON> Kapstein </PERSON>, who has dabbled in the music business as a performer and manager during his 18 years as a public school teacher, wrote and recorded `` RUN G.N.P.,'' a rappin' tribute to the joys of economics. He also had some of his students at Martin Luther King Jr.. Middle School participate in making a video version of the song <PERSON> Kapstein </PERSON> uses both as motivational tools to make economics seem less imposing to the 6th -, 7th - and 8th-grade students in his social studies and history Rather than the academic words of a textbook, <PERSON> Kapstein </PERSON> believes teachers could better introduce young students to economic concepts with such lines as: `` Try to maximize profits Minimize costs That's what I'm tryin' to do Increase productivity Improve the quality So I can bring the best product to you.'' Or how about this explanation of supply and demand: `` Now, when resources get scarce or demand increases the price of goods rise it rarely decreases. People's tastes change and so do I If I want to stay in business I'd better comply.'' And, you can dance to it. `` I thought it was a good idea in this day and age, when kids can rap and memorize pages and pages of -LRB- entertainment -RRB- information, why not do something educational to go along with it,'' <PERSON> Kapstein </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` Economics is sometimes boring and difficult,'' he said. `` I saw this would be a really nice idea. Hell, I write music, songs _ I said let me put something together.'' <PERSON> Kapstein </PERSON>, 40, recorded the song, whose title was inspired by rap stars <ORGANIZATION> RUN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> D.M.C. </ORGANIZATION>, with a small group of professional musicians. He hopes to release it as a single for use by other teachers. The video, set in a city park, has the ragged feel of a home movie, but <PERSON> Kapstein </PERSON> said he'd like to make a more polished version if he can obtain money to cover production costs. Economics is just a small part of the middle school curriculum. But <PERSON> Kapstein </PERSON> believes that if his musical efforts are successful, students will be more inclined toward the subject when they reach high school. `` Kids in high school really put it off ... it's something that really has a low priority,'' <PERSON> Kapstein </PERSON> said. `` We try to dispel the myths, so it's not a terrible monster. `` It can ba a lot of fun, economics can be made easy,'' he added. `` When they get into economics is high school, they're gon na say, ` Yeah.''' <PERSON> Kapstein </PERSON> said the seeds of his idea were planted a couple of years ago when he enrolled in a program at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> that stressed creative and unusual approaches to teaching. Mixing music and economics was a natural for him, <PERSON> Kapstein </PERSON> said. `` I've always been into motivating the kids through music,'' said <PERSON> Kapstein </PERSON>, who in the 1970s managed the career of the late blues singer <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON>. `` I used to bring in Willie Guy during Black History Month, and he was the most effective,'' he said. <PERSON> Kapstein </PERSON> said he has other ideas, but for now he's waiting to see if `` RUN G.N.P.'' catches on. `` If things take off, I'll be turning out songs like crazy,'' he said.

 The biggest-ever order for commercial jetliners extends the comfort margin in an already-hot industry that has outstripped predictions of success, say analysts and officials for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which received the biggest share of the blockbuster order. `` We're in the midst of the biggest boom in -LRB- aviation -RRB- history,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Multibillion-dollar orders have been rolling in over the past few years, and even the industry midgets, such as <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> BV </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, have years of work booked. `` Each succeeding major order is extending by a few weeks the time during which the companies or the industry will be at peak production over the next several years,'' <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON> said. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> GPA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> announced a $ 17 billion order for 308 airliners _ 121 firm orders and options on an additional 187 jets _ from <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION>. The order from the <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, aircraft-leasing concern is the largest civilian aircraft order ever, topping <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>' $ 10.5 billion order for up to 225 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> aircraft last September GPA's order reflects the growing importance of aircraft leasing companies, which account for about one-fifth of all aircraft orders. It also underscores the airlines' concern about replacing their aging fleets. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 9.4 billion share of the order is for 92 737 models, 50 757s and 40 767s, with deliveries over the next seven years. At <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s rate of production, the orders represent about a half-year's work. The order fills production slots into the mid-1990s, said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, and while it provides security for the work force, it wo n't require new employees. Even before the order, he said, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> had a backlog of more than 1,100 aircraft, and the industry giant is predicting all builders will deliver 8,400 new airplanes by 2005 to keep up with demand. `` So while an order like this looks huge, it's really not that big a percentage of total deliveries,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. Last year was a record one for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, which received 636 orders totaling $ 29 billion. So far this year, 301 orders with a value of $ 19.1 billion are on the books of the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> company. Despite the flood of orders, industry analyst <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Turk </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Avmark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said that while the industry is in the clouds it could be brought back to earth in a rush if the world economy sputters. He said <ORGANIZATION> Avmark </ORGANIZATION> believes <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s projections for 8,400 new airplanes in the next 16 years _ which would more than replace the existing fleet of some 7,800 planes _ is overly optimistic. `` But,'' he added, `` the market is very good and it should be very good for a while to come.'' <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON> said he could n't argue with <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s figures. The air-carrier industry, from passengers booking flights to manufacturers and subcontractors, has been flourishing like no one had predicted, he said. The airplane-building business has been growing at an accelerated rate for several years, <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON> said, and hit 8 percent last year. `` If you consider 4 percent growth a year as normal ... your demand for -LRB- new -RRB- aircraft should be around 300 to 350 a year,'' he said. Last year, he said, there were 512 new deliveries across the industry, with <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> providing 289 of those. By 1991, he estimated, 750 could be delivered. Even with an expected leveling off of air travel in the early 1990s, he said, demand for airplanes should remain strong because replacement aircraft are needed. `` For the first time -LRB- in industry history -RRB- we are in the midst of a replacement cycle, as well as a growth cycle that is very strong,'' he said. Besides <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s share of the <ORGANIZATION> GPA </ORGANIZATION> order, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> received a $ 3.1 billion order for 64 MD-80 twin-jets and 8 MD-11 three-jet models, while <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION> won a $ 4.3 billion order for 30 A320s, 10 A330s, and two A340s. In addition, GPA took options on an additional 10 A330s and two A340s.

<TEXT>
 The average age of planes in the fleet of turboprop aircraft used by airlines in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is 3.1 years younger than the average for the jetliner fleet, says an aviation consulting firm. The average age of turboprop aircraft used by airlines in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> is 9.3 years, while the average age of jet aircraft is 12.4 years, according to a study released Tuesday by <ORGANIZATION> Avmark </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which appraises aircraft throughout the world. The report prepared for the <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aging </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commuter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, next week says the average age for the worldwide fleet of turboprops is 11 years old, compared with more than 13 years for passenger jets The study, which groups aircraft by regions of the world, says the North American turboprop fleet is the youngest, while the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> has the oldest aircraft with an average age of 15.4 years. Turboprops in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> average 13.5 years, in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> 13 years, in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> 12.4 years and in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> 12.1 years, according to the report. `` The average age of the commuter-regional turboprop fleet is expected to experience a decline as the operators continue to expand their operations through acquisition of a substantial number of new aircraft in the next decade,'' the report says. It says 68.1 percent of the turboprops in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> were built within the last nine years, while 7.6 percent were built 20 or more years ago. The oldest turboprops are those that carry 40 to 50 passengers, while the youngest are in the 20-39 passenger category. The youngest fleets, according to <ORGANIZATION> Avmark </ORGANIZATION>, belong to the Midway Express system, 3.4 years, and <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commuter </ORGANIZATION>, 3.8 years, while the oldest are operated by <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connector </ORGANIZATION>, 13.2 years, and <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, 12.7 years. Other fleets in the report and the average age of their turboprop planes are <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connection </ORGANIZATION>, 5.6; <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION>, 5.7; <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlink </ORGANIZATION>, 6.5; <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, 6.6; <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, 7.1; TWExpress, 7.9; <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commuter </ORGANIZATION>, 8.1; <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commuter </ORGANIZATION>, 9.0; <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, 10; <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, 10.8, and Canadian Partner, 11. The report covers airplanes in use as of July 1988 and covers those seating 13 passegners or more that were originally designed for passenger use although a few are now being used to haul cargo, <ORGANIZATION> Avmark </ORGANIZATION> said.

 The number of new single-engine aircraft sold by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers increased 28.5 percent in the first quarter, but sales of all other types of smaller aircraft decreased from the same period last year, an industry group reported. In 1988, the small-aircraft industry reported its first increase in a decade of both the number and value of planes delivered. The figures cover sales of civilian planes that carry fewer than 20 passengers and generally are not used by scheduled airlines. The first-quarter report released Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, based on delivery of aircraft, showed 212 single-engine planes sold, compared with 165 in the year-ago quarter. Sales of jet planes dropped from 34 to 23, while turboprop sales were down from 52 to 51 and twin-engine aircraft from 23 to 18. Sales reached $ 302.97 million for the first quarter, compared with $ 377.46 for the first quarter of 1988, and the value of aircraft sold abroad dropped to $ 97.5 million from last year's $ 158.52 million for the quarter, the association reported `` The increase in total aircraft deliveries is an encouraging sign,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stimpson </PERSON>, the association's president. But, he said, the industry has been `` devastated by unfair product liability laws.'' The association supports bills introduced in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that would limit the liability of manufacturers. <PERSON> Stimpson </PERSON> said increased funding to modernize airports is also needed for the industry to grow. The association represents 36 manufacturers of aircraft, engines and related equipment.

<HEAD>Stocks And Bonds Soar On Inflation Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 A government report that said consumer prices rose the most in two years during the first quarter of 1989 triggered purchases of stocks and bonds by investors who had feared the inflation news would be even worse. The Dow Jones 30-stock industrial average gained 41.61 points Monday to close at 2,379.40, a post-crash high. In the credit market, which is especially sensitive to inflation, purchases of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark 30-year bond drove its yield down to 8.93 percent from 9.04 percent late Monday. Bond yields move in the opposite direction of the price. Higher food and energy costs boosted consumer prices 0.5 percent in March, resulting in a 6.1 percent annual inflation rate for the first three months of 1989, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. Last month's gain in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Consumer Price Index was fresh evidence that inflation continues to run above the 4.4 percent rate registered in both 1987 and 1988. `` Inflation was uncomfortably high, widespread and entrenched in March,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` We have n't seen the last of these high numbers because there will still be a rippling through of rising business costs for both materials and wages and rising energy costs in the next few months.'' Still, expectations that the economy is cooling off were bolstered by a report from the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that showed housing starts fell 5.4 percent in March, with construction of single-family homes at the slowest pace in more than four years. `` The only good news on inflation was the bad news on housing, underscoring a weak first-quarter economy and raising hope that later on inflation can recede,'' <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> said. Economist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagens </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Wefa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a forecasting firm in <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said the nation appears destined for a round of `` stagflation,'' in which the economy slows while prices continue to rise, forcing the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to choose between further restraining growth to curb inflation and boosting the economy to stimulate employment. Food costs in March rose 0.8 percent, twice as fast as in February. Taken together, prices for meat, fish and eggs rose 2.4 percent. Energy costs, meanwhile, registered their sharpest increase since August 1987, advancing 1.1 percent, practically double the preceding month's 0.6 percent.

 <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LP </ORGANIZATION> wants to put short hardcover books by respected authors in the briefcases of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s corporate and civic leaders, and is selling advertising space in the books to pay the bill The proposal disclosed Tuesday stirred curiosity in the publishing community, which has generally limited advertising in hardcover books to pitches for either the author's or the publisher's other works. `` Whether it is a ridiculous idea that will fall on its face or be the wave of the future, I ca n't tell yet,'' said <PERSON> Joni </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, the publisher of <ORGANIZATION> Random </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Nansey </PERSON> <PERSON> Neiman </PERSON>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION>, said she has n't decided whether advertising in books would be good for business But, she added, `` As a reader, I'm not sure I want to read a book and find an ad for baby powder, or worse.'' The <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, Tenn.-based <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> said Tuesday it has signed <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Halberstam </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON> and seven other well-known authors for the first of what it says will be several sponsored book series. It would be the first book publishing venture by the fast-growing media concern, which has specialized in creating magazines, posters and television programs that sponsors may use to reach tightly-defined audiences such as new mothers, pet owners or teens at school. Whittle, which is 50 percent-owned by the media giant <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said it plans to publish the first book in what is tentatively called `` The Larger Agenda'' series later this year. It plans five books a year. The other authors signed by Whittle are <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilder </PERSON>, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Atlas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Waterman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Holbrooke </PERSON>, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Seligman </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Greider </PERSON>. They are reportedly being paid an average of $ 60,000 each. Among the topics, <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON> will write about <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, the indicted junk bond pioneer; <PERSON> Holbrooke </PERSON> will explain why business people should care about foreign policy; and <PERSON> Greider </PERSON> will write about the financial system. The books will run about 100 pages, with 20 pages of advertising scattered among 80 pages of editorial text, and will be sent for free to about 150,000 people Whittle considers opinion leaders. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, said the project resulted from research that showed many readers failed to read or finish books because the books were too long and they had too little time. He said writers, meanwhile, wanted an outlet longer than magazines provide but shorter than full-length books. Advertising support provided the financial bridge needed to support the shorter books, he said. <PERSON> Greider </PERSON>, reached in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said liked getting a `` chance to reach what should be a pretty blue-chip audience'' and had no problem with the type of advertising he expects would be included in the series. `` If the book was studded with truss ads and hair-restoring ads and breast implant ads, I could see how you might have some problems with it,'' he said. Whittle plans to sell copies at bookstores nationwide six months after the free distribution and will sell them more cheaply than books without ads. Whittle officials declined to identify advertisers, but a source familiar with the plans, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, will be the sole advertiser in the first series. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said that for competitive reasons, the company does not comment on its advertising plans. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Reidy </PERSON>, president and publisher of <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION>, said paperbacks once routinely carried ads two decades ago but the practice was phased out because of postal regulations and protests from authors. `` I do n't think there will be a rush to do it again,'' she said. <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> said he hoped to be publishing up to 40 books a year generating $ 50 million in annual revenue for his company in five years. The company had $ 150 million in revenue last year.

<HEAD>Ramada Agrees To Sell Hotel Group, Change Name</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> says it will sell its hotel division to a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> firm and give up its 30-year-old trademark of roadside hospitality as it concentrates on its gambling operations in a bid to restore profitability. Ramada announced an agreement Tuesday to sell its 825-unit hotel group and the <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> name to <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 540 million. No name has been chosen for the restructured Ramada, said <PERSON> Ramada </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>. The restructuring was announced last October after <PERSON> Ramada </PERSON> rejected a takeover bid by the <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> family of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, owners of the Hyatt hotel chain. <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said Phoenix-based <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> will keep its four casinos _ one in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and three in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> _ and concentrate on turning a profit. The company has no immediate expansion plans, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 5.1 million last year. The hotel group operates under the <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inns </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotels </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Rodeway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inns </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Renaissance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotels </ORGANIZATION> names. Prime Motor Inns of <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, will pay an undisclosed sum to New World to operate as franchisor of roughly 600 of the moderately priced hotels and motels in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> under the Ramada and Rodeway names. New World, a major real estate company, would be left with about 125 hotels overseas and 15 Renaissance Hotels domestically, <PERSON> Ramada </PERSON> said. Gaming commissions in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the approximately 31,000 Ramada stockholders must approve the transaction, <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. Ramada shareholders will get $ 7 a share in cash and a one-quarter share in the new gaming company. Cole also announced a preliminary estimate of first-quarter results showing revenues of $ 124 million and an operating loss of $ 19 million. Ramada had sales of $ 101.9 million and a $ 364,000 operating loss in the year-earlier quarter. Ramada stock closed at $ 11.37 -LCB-, down 75 cents. The transaction is a major step in Ramada's restructuring plan, begun last October, Chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Snell </PERSON> said. `` New World and Prime are making a major commitment to achieve success for the 800-plus hotels in the Ramada and Rodeway systems,'' <PERSON> Snell </PERSON> said in a statement. `` The present <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> shareholders will benefit from their investment with cash and a continuing interest in the new gaming company.'' Ramada announced March 24 that it had agreed to sell the 152 restaurants in its <ORGANIZATION> Marie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Callender </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shops </ORGANIZATION> restaurant unit to a group of private investors. That sale for undisclosed terms will be completed by the end of the month, <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said the restructuring would be completed within two to three months. Ramada operates the <ORGANIZATION> TropWorld </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> and Entertainment Resort in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, recently refurbished for $ 200 million and reopened as the largest casino there. The $ 60 million <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> opened last June in <LOCATION> Laughlin </LOCATION>, Nev. The two other holdings are the Tropicana Resort and Casino in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON>'s Fabulous 50's Casino in <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>. The new company will employ about 10,000 people, <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. Ramada currently employs about 20,000 _ half in its gaming operations, 5,600 in the hotel group, and about 3,400 in the restaurant business. Studies last year persuaded <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors that gaming was the way to profitability. Ramada last year received $ 477 million in revenue from casino operations and $ 244 million from hotels and motels. Ramada had income from continuing operations from casinos of $ 40 million and operating income from hotels and motels of $ 15 million. <PERSON> Ramada </PERSON> was started by investors who opened a motel in <LOCATION> Flagstaff </LOCATION> in 1954. The group's first motels went by the Flamingo or <ORGANIZATION> Hiway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> names. When the first franchise was awarded in 1959, the name was changed to <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION>, a Spanish word meaning `` shady resting place'' and applied to an open, gazebo-like structure offering shade in treeless areas.

<HEAD>Frequent Flier Who Intervened In Eastern Case Wants Airline Back</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN S. CARLSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Even if the strike against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is never resolved, <PERSON> Moreton </PERSON> <PERSON> Rolleston </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> figures his pilot son and flight attendant daughter-in-law eventually will find work. But he's worried about the effect on competition at <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s airport. The 71-year-old <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> lawyer said Tuesday he intervened in <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy case because he wants to make sure the idled airline returns to operation. `` This is real important to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Rolleston </PERSON> said in an interview. `` Eastern had been running 100,000 people to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> every day, 290 flights a day. Forty percent of the traffic in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> was Eastern.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> scheduled a hearing for next week on <PERSON> Rolleston </PERSON>'s motion to have the court to appoint a trustee to run <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> until parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> can sell it. <PERSON> Rolleston </PERSON> was allowed to intervene in the case because he is a member of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s frequent flier program, which is run jointly with sister carrier <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Since he has mileage credits in the program, which rewards frequent fliers with free trips, the court considered him an Eastern creditor. Eastern spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s current position is that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> is no longer for sale and instead will be trimmed to a smaller size and remain in operation as part of its bankruptcy reorganization. She said <PERSON> Rolleston </PERSON> `` is the father of a striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilot and the father-in-law of a striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> flight attendant, so his interests are more than those of a frequent traveler.'' `` I'm not a stockholder. I have no financial connection with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>. I have not sought out anybody to buy it. I have no strings attached, although I do have a personal interest,'' he said. `` My son is a captain with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>; he's been with Eastern for 22 years, and my daughter-in-law is a flight attendant,'' <PERSON> Rolleston </PERSON> said. `` I'm not going to give you his name because my family is not part of this. What I did, I did as a lawyer and I did it before any of them knew about it.'' Since Eastern went on strike, he said, `` you ca n't get out of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> unless you're on <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'' <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. And <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s flights are so crowded since the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> strike, it's cramping his traveling style. Used to having a choice of flight times, <PERSON> Rolleston </PERSON> complained that, to go to a bankruptcy court hearing on Eastern on Monday, `` I could only get one flight out to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Sunday.'' Eastern workers have been on strike since March 4, contending <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has damaged the airline and plotted to destroy their unions by transferring valuable assets to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> put Eastern into bankruptcy court refuge March 9 and has been seeking a buyer. Ex-baseball Commissioner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> nearly completed a $ 464 million deal to buy Eastern. But the sale fell through over a dispute between the unions and <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> over who would run the airlines until <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>'s investor group could assume control. `` Regardless of whether you agree with them or not _ and I'm not going to take a position on that _ the employees are not going to go back to work as long as <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> controls <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Rolleston </PERSON> said. `` If you had a trustee, the employees would go back to work.'' <PERSON> Rolleston </PERSON> said his son is n't angry that his father jumped into the fray. `` He went to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with me -LRB- for a hearing earlier this week -RRB-, but he's not in the lawsuit, and he does n't want to get involved in the legal end of it,'' <PERSON> Rolleston </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rolleston </PERSON> said his family's involvement in the company is n't the reason he's trying to get Eastern back into operation anyway. `` This is real important to this city,'' he said. `` The fact that it'll help my son and daughter-in-law is fine, but they'll be back flying one of these days anyway. I want <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flying here in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>.''

<TEXT>
 Analysts say billionaire oilman <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has obtained financing that will support a bid of more than $ 100 a share for <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a belief reflected by the sharp climb in the stock price of the parent of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s stock closed Tuesday at $ 97.38, up $ 7.13. It was the most active issue on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 3.5 million shares trading hands. `` This should flush out any competing bids and probably a higher bid from <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has said he would consider increasing his bid of $ 2.7 billion, or $ 90 a share, but did not offer a higher price Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s board has rejected his current bid as inadequate and on Monday directed management to explore a wide range of possible deals to maximize shareholder value. <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON> said the board's announcement may have played the biggest role in making the stock jump. But part of the momentum came from the realization that <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' $ 3.3 billion financial package could support a bid of up to $ 110 a share, said <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivard </PERSON> of Minneapolis-based <ORGANIZATION> Dain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's a very strong financing package,'' said <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuele </PERSON>, who operates a small hedge fund in <LOCATION> Plainfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION> `` If there is anyone else in the wings, they would have to surface now. If they do n't surface, there is no one else in the wings.'' The package would include $ 300 million of <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' own money, a $ 600 million bond offering and a $ 500 million loan from <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION>. The balance would be a loan arranged by <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> from a syndicate of major banks, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> would provide a $ 250 million backup revolving line of credit to be available to supplement <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s working capital, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said `` <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> would n't undertake this unless they felt their client had a serious purpose,'' <PERSON> Schuele </PERSON> said. In state government circles, where officials have expressed fear that <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> would break up the Eagan-based airline to pay takeover debt, there was some criticism of the financial package. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Commerce Commissioner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said the package would require annual debt payments of up to $ 450 million, depending on the interest rates. `` The company had a profit last year of $ 135 million,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said. `` Where does he get the other $ 300 million? What he presented today does n't give that answer and very frankly that's the question.'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> has supported efforts in the <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to pass laws that would discourage a takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, which employs more than 15,000 people in the state. Gov. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> said actions are still being pursued on the state and federal levels to thwart a takeover even though he believes <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> is determined to buy <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> repeated Tuesday that he would not have to sell `` strategic'' assets or cut employment to finance the takeover. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Daugherty </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> would have second thoughts about not selling strategic assets if a recession develops. He said the debt load of <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' plan would be `` burdensome'' on the airline. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> has said it will provide non-public information to <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and other `` qualified third parties'' interested in buying the company. Management has received approval to negotiate with <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, but neither the company nor a <ORGANIZATION> Davis </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> would say whether the two sides had made contact. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s board also said it would explore restructuring moves including the acquisition of another company, a partial or complete liquidation of the airline, a repurchase of shares, a special dividend to shareholders, or a sale of equity to third parties. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Genoese </PERSON>, who heads the airline division of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>, on Friday said <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> might be considering buying financially troubled <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>. The company would not comment on the rumor.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge has refused to lift an injunction against <ORGANIZATION> MAI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Four </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 970 million hostile bid for <ORGANIZATION> Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON> said Tuesday he would not remove the injunction until MAI, a <LOCATION> Tustin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, computer firm, provides Prime stockholders with audited year-end financial statements from MAI's investment bank, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> The ruling will further delay <ORGANIZATION> MAI </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 20-per-share tender offer for Prime, a Natick-based computer maker with revenue of $ 1.59 billion last year. The tender offer has been enjoined since Dec. 9 when <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON> ruled that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s involvement in the takeover battle was so extensive that the bank should be considered a co-bidder and had to disclose financial information. `` We are very gratified that Judge <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON> has ordered MAI and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to make the disclosures we have been seeking for five months,'' said Prime spokesman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavaghan </PERSON>. MAI also is waging a proxy battle for control of Prime's board of directors at the company's June 14 annual meeting. Prime Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said the current board is committed to selling the company but considers <ORGANIZATION> MAI </ORGANIZATION>'s offer too low. MAI filed financial disclosure documents with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> April 6 in an effort to satisfy <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON> and remove the injunction. In his ruling Tuesday, the judge said most of those documents, including a list of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s trades in Prime stock, were adequate. But he said <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s statement of financial condition, which was for the first nine months of 1988, was not current enough. <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON> said he would not lift the injunction until 10 days after <ORGANIZATION> MAI </ORGANIZATION> certifies that it has mailed <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s year-end statement to Prime stockholders. At the same time, the judge denied a motion from Prime to place another injunction on the offer because of alleged violations of Federal Reserve margin requirements.

 The French oil and chemical company that agreed to take over <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> last month has extended its tender offer three weeks, officials announced.

<HEAD>EEC Plans To Clear Plessey Takeover Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> plans to clear the $ 3 billion takeover bid for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s defense-electronics company, <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION>, by <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, it was announced Wednesday. If the provisional decision by the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> is confirmed, it could clear the way for the creation of a new electronics giant in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In a statement, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s competition commissioner Sir <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brittan </PERSON> said the commission `` had come to the conclusion that the proposed arrangements do not raise objections under the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s competition rules. <PERSON> Brittan </PERSON> stressed, however, that all parties concerned and the public would be invited to comment before a final decision was made. He said that <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION> would have six weeks to respond to the commission. Then, according to what the company says in its response, the commission would either confirm its decision or look at the case again. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s opinion was issued prior to the publication in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> of a review of the bid by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monopolies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Brittan </PERSON> said his proposed clearance of the bid excluded <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION>'s defense interests because EEC rules allow member states to take unilateral measures necessary to protect these interests. He said that <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> GEC </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> had pledged to maintain <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION>'s semi-conductor activities as a distinct company under <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION> management and to support related research and development. The commission said that <ORGANIZATION> GEC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> agreed not to make any `` substantial modifications'' in those activities without obtaining the approval of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> antitrust officials launched the probe into the bid for <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION> after the company asked the commission last December to block the bid under the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s competition rules. These rules outlaw any industrial agreement likely to distort free competition. <ORGANIZATION> GEC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION> are <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s two largest defense-electronics contractors. <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION>, with <ORGANIZATION> NV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, is one of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s two top electronics groups.

 Stung by bad publicity from the government's massive securities fraud probes and slumping business since the 1987 stock market crash, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is shedding its 2,300-employee retail brokerage unit as part of a major restructuring The nation's fifth-largest investment firm said Tuesday it will try to sell the brokerage unit, which accounts for about 10 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s business, to another brokerage house. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> said it also is abandoning its business in municipal securities, over-the-counter stocks, and research and transactions in non-U.S. securities. The restructuring will cut <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s work force by about a third. The move comes five days after <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> agreed to tight federal oversight for three years in settling civil fraud charges with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> Chief Executive <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> announced the restructuring over the firm's public address system, calling the verdict by its board of directors last weekend `` the only economically viable solution.'' He said the move was made to so <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> could deal with the `` current realities'' at the firm, implying the government's nearly three-year investigation of alleged securities abuses, many involving the <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s dealings with jailed inside trader <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>. `` The decision was made in view of the anticipated inability to grow the retail business to an economically viable size in light of ongoing adverse publicity ...,'' <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> pact clears the way for settlement of criminal fraud charges with the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to plead guilty to six felonies and pay a record $ 650 million to avoid a massive racketeering indictment. A rash of civil lawsuits over <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s activities, possibly numbering in the thousands, now are expected to be filed in individual states. In addition, congressional officials have indicated they plan further investigations into <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>. The continued investigations, along with the possible high-visibility trial of former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> junk-bond financier <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, means the firm will remain in a negative spotlight for some time. `` It's a kind of situation that's very sensitive as far as retail clients are concerned,'' said <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>. In its statement, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> cited `` the depressed state of the securities industry, the anticipated lack of participation by individual investors'' and increased competition from commercial banks in retail brokerage. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, which does not release earnings or other detailed financial data, said it has total capital of about $ 2 billion and net equity capital of about half that. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON> declined to give details on the extent of the retail business decline, but said: `` It was just getting difficult. Indeed, the numbers were going in the other direction.'' After a board meeting Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> said it notified about 10 other Wall Street firms about peddling the division. It said it hopes to have bids by Saturday and a sale completed by early next week. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s statement said the firm would concentrate on high-yield junk bonds, government securities, corporate finance, institutional fixed income activities, mortgage-backed securities, arbitrage and commodities. Business on Wall Street has been sluggish because of high interest rates, continued investor distrust following the October 1987 market crash, and a severe decline in mergers and acquisitions. Several firms announced weak first-quarter profits in the last week. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> itself has shrunk from a high of about 10,000 employees worldwide to 9,100 today. The 10 percent payroll decline is about average for Wall Street firms, most of which laid off hundreds of employees after the crash. The retail brokerage unit has lost about 200 brokers from a high of 1,300. It now has about 1,100 brokers and another 1,200 employees. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> declined to say how many people would be laid off in the restructuring. `` Individuals prefer money market instruments, savings accounts to speculation or even investments,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanbury </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Wertheim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schroder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's cyclical. We're in a down cycle.'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> named <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> as possible buyers. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON> said his firm is not interested in the unit. Because of the planned personnel reduction, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> also said it had informed the city of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that it was scrapping plans to build new <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> offices.

 Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> would try to cap oil prices by raising their production if the cartel's oil basket price went beyond $ 19 a barrel, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> sources said Wednesday. They said that such an understanding was reached at the group's last full ministerial meeting in November Representatives from <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s 13 member countries agreed at that gathering to limit output to 18.5 million barrels a day to achieve a target price of $ 18 a barrel. Their current production is estimated at 19.6 million barrels a day. The sources said that if the $ 19-price trigger was pulled, the market would see increased oil output from member countries, many of whom are operating at well below their potential production capacity. The <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil basket price was at $ 18.49 a barrel at midday Wednesday, compared with $ 18.25 a barrel a week ago. The basket is calculated as a running seven-day average of the spot, or non-contact, prices of seven crude oils. The sources were responding to questions about what <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s response would be to the shutdown of the entire <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> Brent production and delivery system following an accident late Tuesday The gas leak and explosion on <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> U.K. Exploration and Production's Cormorant Alpha platform reduced <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil output by 472,000 barrels a day, or by one-quarter of the British sector's total output There were no injuries. The accident pushed up oil prices sharply. The spot price of Brent Blend, the most widely traded international crude oil, was trading at $ 21.50 a barrel in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> late Wednesday morning, up from $ 20.05 late Tuesday. An <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman at the group's Secretariat in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> declined to comment. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s members are <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Oil Futures Surge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Oil futures prices surged in early trading today as concern spread that a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil explosion could disrupt petroleum deliveries. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the May contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of crude oil, had jumped $ 1.21 a barrel to $ 22.72 at about 11 a.m. EDT. The contract closed at $ 21.51 on Tuesday. `` Details are still vague but there's a possibility that some companies are n't able to deliver on cargos due a week from today,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, energy broker with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` This is impacting the market in a very big way.'' The explosion and fire on the small oil Cormorant Alpha platform owned by <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.K. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exploration </ORGANIZATION> and Production on Tuesday shut down the North Sea Brent oil field, interrupting production of nearly 500,000 barrels a day of oil, officials said today. `` The Cormorant is a gathering station. The Brent crude must flow through this one smaller station,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, oil analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> officials were expected to examine the damage today and decide how long the pipelines would remain closed, analysts said. Energy brokers said the timing of the event, following the Alaskan oil spill, could drive prices significantly higher. The spill off the Alaskan coast on March 24 closed down oil shipping lanes and disrupted the flow of oil to refineries in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for several days. Since then, prices of both crude and refined products have risen by more than 10 cents. Crude prices have risen nearly 80 percent since last October when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided to reduce oil production. In addition, problems with other <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil facilities and lower production by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have helped push prices higher.

However, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> complained that <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>'s reassuring comments about the health of <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls, as late as a month before last November's presidential election, `` amounted to `` an intravenous shot of morphine that would have numbed anyone to the crisis. Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, offered a warm personal defense of Wall, who worked for him for 17 years, dating back to <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>'s days as mayor of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He praised Wall's honesty and integrity, adding, `` Let's do an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report on this man. It'll be so dull, so boring that nobody would want to read it.'' Meanwhile, Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, an opponent of the package, threatened to prolong debate unless the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> adopts a half-dozen amendments, including several pro-consumer measures. `` If you're going to cost the consumers of this country ... the least you can do is make them feel good about it and give them a little something,'' he said. The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., and <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, the panel's senior <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION>, have so far defeated attempts to amend the bill in the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> All 21 members of the committee have endorsed the bill. The legislation basically tracks the proposal presented in February by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, pledging $ 157 billion to the problem over the next 10 years and providing a host of reforms, chief among them a requirement that S & amp; L owners back their lending with more of their own capital. On a 50-48 vote _ 12 short of the 60-vote majority required _ the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday rejected an effort by <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> to add $ 50 billion of the plan's cost to the fiscal 1989 budget. That move could have stuck <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with the biggest federal deficit in history. Earlier, senators voted 66-32 to beat an amendment that would have weakened the administration's control over disposal of an estimated $ 400 billion in real estate owned by failed S & amp; Ls. Objections by <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> threatened to spoil <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders' plans to pass the bill today and leave for an 11-day recess <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> has not specified what he wants. However, he said possibilities include requiring banks and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls to offer cheap checking accounts for poor people and free cashing of government checks. He also wants financial institutions to disclose their performance in serving minorities and he wants the government to reopen last year's S & amp; L rescues. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said he would recess the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday to observe the first day of Passover, then, if <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> desired, return on Friday and keep senators working into the weekend. However, Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill., said supporters of the bill would file a motion today seeking to force a vote on final passage by Friday The House version of <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L legislation passed a Banking subcommittee this week. It is scheduled for consideration by the full committee next week and by the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> by the end of May. Following a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference, that could put the bill on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s desk in June, four months after he announced his plan. On the funding mechanism, six Democratic senators joined 44 Republicans in support of the administration plan, which was opposed by 47 Democrats and one Republican. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> had argued that financing the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L bailout through regular <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> borrowings would be $ 4.5 billion cheaper than the administration's plan to borrow the money through a quasi-public agency and keep $ 50 billion out of the budget deficit. However, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s plan could have ballooned the 1989 budget deficit within range of the all-time high of $ 221 billion, set in 1986. An amendment by Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>, D-Neb., would have loosened administration control of the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L bailout agency <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wanted the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and the attorney general to run the agency. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill adds two outside members to the board, but <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> would have added four outside members, enough to outvote the government officials.

<HEAD>Soybeans Gain On Brazilian Dock Strike</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Soybean prices for near-term delivery rose strongly this morning on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> on perceptions that a 9-day-old Brazilian dockworkers strike is disrupting exports of Brazilian soybeans. Grain futures were modestly higher in early trading, but gains in most markets were being held in check by prospects for rain in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> later this week. No substantial progress was reported at a formal mediation session Tuesday in efforts to end the nationwide dockworkers strike in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, the world's second-largest soybean producer after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Weather forecasts continue to exert a strong influence on the markets, where memories of last summer's drought linger. Many private forecasters are still predicting dry weather in the Corn Belt all the way into next week but some see an increasing likelihood of showers in the region later this week. In early trading, wheat was 1 cent to 6 cents higher with the contract for delivery in May at $ 4.13 a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1 cent higher with May at $ 2.76 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 2 \ cents to 2 -RCB- cents higher with May at $ 2.01 a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent lower to 7 -LCB- cents higher with May at $ 7.56 a bushel Livestock and meat futures were modestly lower in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .18 cent to .57 cent lower with June at 70.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to .55 cent lower with May at 75.90 cents a pound; live hogs were .03 cent to .25 cent lower with June at 46.42 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .50 cent to .72 cent lower with May at 32.70 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Shearson Reports $15 Million Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it lost $ 15 million in the first quarter, attributing the $ 90 million decline from last year to sluggish Wall Street business activity and higher interest rates. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> is the fifth investment firm to report a loss or lower earnings in the last week. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it is selling its retail brokerage unit, in part because of a business decline. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> said the loss for the quarter compared with a $ 75 million profit, or 75 cents a share, in the same 1988 period. The firm said the decline reflects a $ 35.2 million pre-tax write-down of MCorp securities held by the firm, lower investment banking revenue and lower net interest income. The decline came despite an increase in revenue to $ 3 billion from $ 2.5 billion a year ago. `` The disappointing results for the quarter reflect the continuing low level of investor participation in the financial markets and the impact of higher interest rates,'' <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coehn </PERSON> said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> said it is continuing `` cost control efforts'' including an agreement to sell a shareholder services group and negotiations to sell an asset management subsidiary. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> said investment banking revenue for the quarter totaled $ 243 million, a 31.9 perent drop from $ 357 million a year ago. The firm said the decline reflects `` the industry-wide slowdown in underwriting merger and acquisition activity.'' Commission revenues increased 9.5 percent to $ 436 million from $ 398 million a year ago. Revenues from market-making and principal transactions fell 9.6 percent to $ 319 million from $ 353 million in the 1988 quarter. The firm also showed a 71.2 percent drop in net interest income, to $ 19 million from $ 66 million a year ago, blaming a rise in short-term rates that have often outpaced long-term ones. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> owns a controlling stake in <LOCATION> Shearson </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Mostly Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices were mostly lower in early trading today, as the market took back some of Tuesday's strong gains amid sharply rising oil prices. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark 30-year issue was down about 7-32 point, or about $ 2 for every $ 1,000 in face amount before noon EDT. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, rose to 8.95 from 8.93 late Tuesday. The market opened lower today after a surge in bond prices on Tuesday following two economic reports that provided further evidence that the economy is slowing. The reports on consumer prices and housing starts suggested that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s policy of pushing interest rates higher has moderated economic growth and helped ease inflationary pressures The government reported that consumer prices jumped 0.5 percent in March, or about what the market expected, while housing starts fell 5.4 percent last month. Analysts said the market pulled back slightly this morning partly on profit-taking and amid surging crude oil prices stemming from an oil and gas explosion in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. `` Higher oil prices means higher inflation,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenbaum </PERSON>, energy analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inflation erodes the value of fixed-income securities, such as notes and bonds In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities, prices of short-term government issues were unchanged to 3-32 point lower, intermediate maturities were down between -LRB- point and 5-32 point and long-term issues were down as much as 7-32 point, according to <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, was down 1.54 to 1,131.29. In corporate trading, industrials edged up. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures the total return on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, was up 0.26 to 302.86. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills were down to 8.73 percent as the discount fell 3 basis points to 8.46 percent. Yields on six-month bills fell to 8.88 percent as the discount lost 3 basis points to 8.40 percent. Yields on one-year bills, meanwhile, rose to 9.17 percent as the discount rose 4 basis points to 8.48 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted at 9 -RCB-, up from 9 -LCB- percent late Tuesday.

 Stock prices pushed ahead today, getting a little more mileage out of the rally that has carried the market to its highest levels since the crash of 1987. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 41.61 points on Tuesday, rose another 9.53 to 2,388.93 by noontime on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 709 up, 573 down and 554 unchanged. Analysts said stocks have drawn support in recent days from spreading hopes that inflationary pressures might be easing and interest rates were turning downward. Inflation figures for March, unlike those for the two previous months, contained no unpleasant surprises that seemed likely to prompt the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to tighten credit further. However, brokers say, signs of a slowing economy also raise some new worries for investors. For one thing, some observers suggest, they could lead to heightened concern about the possibility of a recession. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> rose -RRB- to 33 -LCB-. The company reported a 20.6 percent increase in its first quarter earnings, and said it had a good chance to keep up that pace. <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>, which also posted a strong first-quarter earnings gain, climbed 2 | to 125 <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION>, among the volume leaders in the over-the-counter market, rose 1 -RCB- to 55. The company reported earnings for the fiscal quarter ended March 31 of 73 cents a share, up from 67 cents in the comparable period a year earlier. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks added .42 to 171.55. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index was up .59 at 339.79. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 94.58 million shares at noontime, against 104.96 million at the same point Tuesday.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a natural gas and petroleum products pipeline company that has been pursued by two companies, said today earnings for the first quarter of 1989 improved by 97 percent partly because of an $ 11.6 million settlement in a pipeline project. For the first three months of this year, the Houston-based company posted earnings of $ 57.5 million, or $ 1.02 per share, on operating revenue of $ 1 billion, compared to $ 29.2 million, or 55 cents per share, on revenue of $ 898 million for the same period in 1988. Included in the profits were $ 11.6 million in non-recurring gains primarily due to settlement of anti-trust litigation associated with the <ORGANIZATION> ETSI </ORGANIZATION> coal slurry pipeline project, in which <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> was a partner. Excluding $ 29.2 milion in non-recurring net charges relating to events which led to the pending merger of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the company had net earnings of $ 86.7 million for the three month period ending March 31. `` We are pleased with the company's first period performance. It reflects the results of the extensive restructuring program undertaken during the past two years; the company has posted four consecutive quarter-to-quarter improvements in net earnings,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>. `` The asset disposition program and efficiencies achieved through decentralization and staff reductions have returned the company's earnings to levels attained during the early 1980s when the company benefitted from much higher crude oil prices,'' he said. The battle for <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> between <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> began Jan. 16 when <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> announced its surprise $ 2.6 billion takeover bid. But the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> board rejected the offer as too low, signing the merger agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 21. <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 3.2 billion offer includes provisions to buy up to 80 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s 60.8 million outstanding shares and a stock exchange at the same $ 53-a-share value for the remaining shares. The combination of the two companies would create a 27,000-mile system and result in one of the nation's largest pipeline companies in terms of miles. Earlier this week, <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> extended its tender offer until March 31, while <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> extended their offer to April 26.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> panel today recommended restrictions on most forms of `` dual trading,'' the doubling of its surveillance staff and improved auditing in response to a federal fraud investigation. `` Some of these proposals were under study prior to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation. But the failure to respond quickly would have shown a lack of leadership,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Geldermann </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to Review Trading Practices. <ORGANIZATION> Geldermann </ORGANIZATION> also is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION>, to whom the recommendations are submitted for a decision expected within 60 days. Dual trading enables a trader on the exchange to deal for his own account as well as customers' accounts. While the practice is legal, many consider it a problem because it allows traders to allocate profitable deals to their own accounts and dump losing trades on customers. Proponents argue that dual trading increases liquidity because traders can continue doing business when they do n't have outside orders. But the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> committee, recognizing the public perception that the practice trading invites abuse, recommended dual trading be banned from futures contracts in cases where market volume is great enough to ensure liquidity. The panel also recommended the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>'s fulltime floor surveillance team be doubled from four to eight staff members and said the exchange's disciplinary committees should include a person who is not a <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> member. `` It's hardly cynical to say that they're hoping to act in advance of the government,'' <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kellogg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview a day before the recommendations were formally released. `` Frankly, I suspect the leadership at the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> is upset by some of the revelations coming out of the probe. Remember also that the futures industry has prospered with self-regulation and they would like to keep control,'' <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> added. The nine-member committee was appointed in late January, following disclosure the federal government was investigating allegations that as many as 100 brokers at the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> systematically cheated investors out of millions of dollars through illegal trading practices. Although as many as 200 subpeonas reportedly have been issued to traders and firms at the world's two largest futures exchanges, no indictments have been issued thus far. Among the members of the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> committee are <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON>, chairman of the executive committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> and special counsel to the exchange's <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, who formerly headed the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the federal agency that regulates the industry. Shortly after it was assembled, the committee asked <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilmouth </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, to assist in its review of trading practices. The <ORGANIZATION> NFA </ORGANIZATION> is the industry's chief watchdog organization. The exchanges have successfully fought off repeated attempts for increased regulation in the past, most recently after the 1987 stock market crash. At the time, some critics blamed the futures exchanges for market volatility that may have worsened the crash. But the exchanges, in a successful effort to forestall more government intervention, argued that futures selling actually provided an outlet that prevented the crash from getting worse.

 <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Signal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday a 12.5 percent increase in first-quarter earnings, attributing the rise, in part, to improved performance by its aerospace unit.

First-quarter revenue was flat at $ 2.9 billion. `` We have been concentrating on lowering our costs and improving our current earnings,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hennessy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of Allied Signal. `` Our results for the quarter are on target, and we expect earnings to continue strong for the rest of the year,'' <PERSON> Hennessy </PERSON> said in a news release.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar closed higher on Wednesday against most of the major currencies in European trading, boosted by rising oil prices. Gold prices were mixed. Foreign exchange dealers said higher oil prices and portfolio adjustments by dealers after the dollar's decline on Tuesday lifted the dollar. They said oil price rise encouraged speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would be more likely than the central banks in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to encourage higher interest rates in response to inflationary pressures. However, one dealer in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> said he did n't expect to see the dollar much stronger because recent government reports have indicated weakness in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy, a development that would discourage credit-tightening by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>. The benchmark price of oil from the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>'s Brent field was marked up WEdnesday by $ 1.48 to $ 21.13 a barrel for delivery next month, after news that the entire field had been shut down by a platform gas explosion. The field produces nearly one-quarter of the British sector's ouput of around 2 million barrels daily. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound fell to $ 1.7113 late Wednesday from $ 1.7185 late Tuesday. Other late rates for the dollar in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with Tuesday's late rates, included: 1.8615 West German marks, up from 1.8528; 1.6360 Swiss francs, up from 1.6283; 6.3025 French francs, up from 6.2750; 2.0985 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0935; 1,363.75 Italian lire, down from 1,366.95; and 1.1865 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1848. Earlier in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 131.88 Japanese yen, down from 132.10 yen late Tuesday. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar traded at 132.10 yen. In the bullion markets, gold traded at a bid of $ 383.95 a troy ounce in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, up from $ 383.25 late Tuesday. But the late bid price for gold fell to $ 383.50 an ounce in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> from $ 384.00 late Tuesday. Earlier in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold closed at $ 384.25 an ounce, down from $ 386.68 late Tuesday.

Growth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Bristol-Myers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, maker of many widely known brands including Bufferin and Excedrin pain relievers and <ORGANIZATION> Clairol </ORGANIZATION> hair care products, Wednesday reported its first-quarter profit rose 12.6 percent to a record level. Two other companies in the pharmaceutical business _ <ORGANIZATION> Squibb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Schering-Plough </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ also posted healthy earnings for the quarter. Bristol-Myers said after-tax earnings amounted to $ 237 million, or 82 cents a share, in the three months ended March 31, up from $ 210.6 million, or 73 cents a share, in 1988's first quarter. Sales for the quarter were the highest in the company's history, rising just over 5 percent to $ 1.60 billion from $ 1.52 billion. International sales gained 11 percent while domestic sales were up 3 percent. Bristol-Myers, based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, has operations in non-prescription and prescription drugs, toiletries and household products, such as Windex and Drano. It did not provide any specific information about the financial performance of its individual operations. Industry analysts have said Bristol-Myers has been a leader in manufacturing anti-cancer drugs and has benefited from the popularity of its anti-anxiety agent, BuSpar. Squibb said its first-quarter earnings rose 17.2 percent to $ 106.5 million, or $ 1.09 a share, from $ 90.9 million, or 89 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales increased 11 percent to $ 662.7 million from $ 596.9 million. The <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION>, N.J.-based company's chairman and chief executive officer, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Furland </PERSON>, said the balance sheet improvements reflected excellent performances by <PERSON> Squibb </PERSON>'s leading products, better gross margins and a slight leverage on operating expenses. These positive factors more than compensated for a 23 percent rise in research and development costs and flat sales growth in traditional products. <ORGANIZATION> Schering-Plough </ORGANIZATION> said its net income rose 23.8 percent in the first quarter to $ 125.7 million, or $ 1.12 a share, from $ 101.5 million, or 91 cents a share, the year before. Sales increased 10.5 percent to $ 831.8 million from $ 752.5 million. <ORGANIZATION> Schering-Plough </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, attributed the overall growth mainly to sales in its pharmaceutical businesses, which expanded 14 percent. Sales of <ORGANIZATION> Schering-Plough </ORGANIZATION>'s consumer products, such as Coppertone sun protection products and Dr. <PERSON> Scholl </PERSON>'s foot care line, rose more modestly. Among the products pacing the increase in pharmaceutical sales were items to treat asthma, cardiovascular problems and dermatological disorders, <ORGANIZATION> Schering-Plough </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Corn and soybean futures prices closed with steep losses Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> following midday forecasts for an increased chance of rain in the western Corn Belt later this week. But wheat futures advanced on persistent talk of hot, dry weather in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and on news that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> is seeking to buy 300,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat at subsidized prices. `` Welcome to the weather market,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, a grain specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, referring to the recent volatility in the grain markets. Some private meteorologists who had been predicting dry weather for the rest of this week in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and northwestern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> forecast rain in their noon forecasts on Wednesday, prompting heavy selling of corn and soybean contracts. The markets are unusually sensitive to weather forecasts because last year's drought lowered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain stockpiles.

At the close, wheat was unchanged to 4 -RCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in May at $ 4.11 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 2 -LCB- cents to 4 -LCB- cents lower with May at $ 2.73 a bushel; oats were 1 \ cents to 3 -LCB- cents lower with May at $ 1.97 a bushel; soybeans were 3 -LCB- cents to 11 cents lower with May at $ 7.45 a bushel

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dell </PERSON> _ 24-year-old college-dropout whiz kid multimillionaire who made his fortune cloning computers _ has a problem, he says. Wall Street does n't understand his 5-year-old company. Financial analysts are n't sure <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dell </PERSON> understands business. <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> wowed Wall Street by taking a company from startup to $ 257.8 million in annual sales and $ 14.4 million in profit by selling copies of the popular <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> personal computers. <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION> carted three computers off to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> in 1984, promptly sold them at a profit and began making clones in his condominium near the campus. Soon he was earning up to $ 80,000 a month and figured computers, not classrooms, were where he should direct his attention. Not bad for a pre-med major who began tinkering with computers in high school and used to hang out at the local Radio Shack store in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> begging his orthodontist father for a PC. Success in the muddled <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> clone market brought <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION> much favorable publicity in financial and trade publications. He was labeled an `` innovation upstart,'' `` computer industry's latest whiz kid'' and `` entrepreneur in short pants.'' But <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION>'s gimmick was marketing, not technology. He bypassed retailers, going directly to consumers through advertisements in user magazines and selling his wares over the phone from <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>. Then last year, <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION> ran into a $ 104 million inventory buildup and the bitter departure of a senior vice president. The buildup knocked revenue and sales predictions askew. Even <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the investment firms that helped with last year's initial public offering, now is telling customers to buy another computer stock instead. After an initial price of $ 8.50 per share, the stock climbed to $ 13, but fell to $ 6 after the problems became apparent. It currently is hanging around $ 7. The problems shifted the headlines, in <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION>'s own words, `` from whiz kid to fizz kid.'' One publication called him `` the enfant terrible of personal computers.'' `` We think the perception of the company is quite different than what's going on here,'' <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION> said, describing his company as `` a new, unique and different kind of entity ... we have merged a design and manufacturing operation for computers together into an entity.'' But even <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION> admits there were problems, although he attributes them to success-caused malfunctions that have been fixed. `` I think the stock market is going to wait until it sees tangible proof that <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION> is turning around,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, who follows <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION>. `` The balance sheet has eroded; margins have eroded,'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION> `` has phenomenal long-term prospects,'' he said, but the market focuses on immediate gratification. To explain his problems, <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION> draws diagrams on a note pad to demonstrate how a backlog of orders in the second quarter of the year inflated third quarter sales, which in turn caused forecasters to expect unrealistic fourth quarter production. At the same time, <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION> was anticipating huge fourth quarter sales based on a barrage of favorable reviews in computer magazines. The sales did n't reach expectations, saddling the company with a large _ and in some cases high-priced _ inventory. `` I think he's right that the backlog issue created too high expectations,'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> admitted, but added, `` If overlooking that made us have high expectations, he did it too.'' Much like a chastised teen-ager promising he has changed, <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION> says his company has learned from the past, with a new structure and some new managers. `` The best thing I could do for the company is to find the best people and give them the responsibility to do the job,'' he said during an interview in his penthouse office in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>'s exclusive Arboretum business park. <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION> describes his workers, who average about 27 years old, as `` 1,200 totally fired up, foaming at the mouth employees.'' He often points to <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, vice president of research and development. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, 47, came from <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s nearby laboratory in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, where he helped the giant develop its Unix program for PCs. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> is trying to turn the company to more technological innovation, and <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION> holds two of its own patents with more pending. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Beachum </PERSON>, hired on at <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Beachum </PERSON> left last year following a bitter dispute with <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION> over most areas of the business <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION> said the blowup `` hurt the entire company, hurt me, hurt <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, hurt the employees here,'' but <PERSON> Beachum </PERSON> had to go because `` clearly we had a guy here who was not the right guy.'' For his part, <PERSON> Beachum </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Week </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION> was unwilling to spend money building a sales force, and that <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION>'s plan for a Personal System-2 clone was `` ego-driven. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> since has scrapped those plans, and <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION> says he learned he should n't announce products before they're ready to be shipped. In the reorganization, <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION> established separate subsidiaries for domestic and overseas clients. Within <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> are divisions for small customers, principally individuals and small businesses; larger businesses; potential customers in government and education; and resellers. In the meantime, <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION> enjoys his riches _ he owns 10.7 million shares of the company, even after selling 300,000 shares at about $ 11 per share, or $ 3.3 million. Though <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION> says his job `` is not what I would consider work,'' he does not consider himself the stereotypical yuppie obsessed with the quest for riches and is planning to marry in a few months. `` I work a fairly normal set of hours for a busy person like myself,'' he says. `` I take a good number of vacations to make sure that I'm well-prepared to do my job.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> earnings rose 10 percent in the latest quarter, the personal computer software maker said Wednesday, belying its own forecast of an earnings decline. <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> rival <ORGANIZATION> Ashton-Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported a small earnings gain, while <ORGANIZATION> Wang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> predicted it would post the worst quarterly loss in two years in its third fiscal quarter. <PERSON> Redmond </PERSON>, Wash.-based <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 41.1 million, or 73 cents per share, in the third fiscal quarter ended March 31, up from $ 37.3 million, or 67 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 22 percent to $ 197 million from $ 161.8 million a year earlier. For the first nine months of its fiscal year, <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings rose 33.3 percent to $ 184.1 million, or $ 2.23 a share, from $ 140.9 million, or $ 1.68 a share, a year earlier Revenue rose 38.8 percent to $ 583.3 million from $ 420.4 million a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION>'s stock plunged last month when the company predicted an earnings decline, the first such drop since the company went public three years ago. Some shareholders complained last month that they were n't adequately warned about the company's difficulties Now it turns out that the warnings were overstated. March results turned out better than expected, according to <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Edstrom </PERSON>, a spokeswoman at <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION>'s public relations firm. `` At least this news was better than the other news,'' she said. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON>, Mass.-based <ORGANIZATION> Wang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> said it expects to lose some $ 55 million in its third quarter. Last week, <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> announced plans to drop its worldwide payroll to 28,500 by June 1990. It had 31,700 employees in November, when it began a policy of not filling vacancies. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> plans to release its actual earnings figure Friday, two days behind schedule. In a statement released Wednesday, the computer manufacturer said unit sales and total revenues will be `` approximately equal'' to that of the previous quarter and the third quarter of fiscal 1988. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>'s sales totalled $ 767.9 million a year ago and $ 760.7 million in 1989's second quarter. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> blamed this quarter's loss on increased discounting of product sales, lower maintentance revenue in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and a shift to lower-margin sales of personal computers. The firm's main business is minicomputers The firm has followed 1988's $ 92 million gain with disappointing profits of $ 13.1 million and $ 1 million the first two quarters of this fiscal year. <ORGANIZATION> Ashton-Tate </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Torrance </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said its net income rose to $ 11.5 million, or 44 cents a share, from $ 11.1 million, or 43 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $ 89.8 million from $ 72.4 million a year earlier. The company attributed the flat earnings to increased research and development and sales and marketing expenses.

<HEAD>Pickens Says Corporate Buyouts Will Find Their Way into Japan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN MOFFAT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 American takeover specialist <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said Wednesday that corporate buyouts helped invigorate the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy in the 1980s, and similar tactics will find their way into Japanese business in the 1990s. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for talks with management of <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> after buying 20.2 percent of its shares _ a move he said was not a prelude to a takeover attempt or greenmail. `` We want to work with <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> managment. We are n't doing anything hostile,'' he said, adding that he was investing for `` the long term.'' Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION>, which expressed surprise and concern at the time of <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' purchase, announced Wednesday evening that it was transferring the shares to <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' ownership, dropping a request to the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> to investigate whether there were any technical irregularities that might block the purchase. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> is scheduled to meet Thursday with the president of the company, said a company spokesman. At a luncheon Wednesday with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> argued that corporate buyouts helped put the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy back on its feet in the 1980s by ousting ineffective management and making its companies more competitive. `` What happened in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> in the 1980s will find its way to the Japanese business community in the 1990s,'' he said. Analysts in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> say <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' visit is a challenge to basic thinking in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s business community that a company belongs to its employees, not its shareholders. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> gained fame and fortune in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by buying and reorganizing companies and often purging company executives, arguing that bad managers do n't give shareholders the returns they deserve. He said in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Wednesday that his `` shareholders' rights'' movement would soon spread to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` Shareholders rights will become a worldwide issue,'' he added. But many Japanese businessmen, and some foreign critics, believe that the American emphasis on return to shareholders has caused <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies to lose competitiveness to Japanese companies. `` Japanese companies do n't generally have to answer to shareholders with short-term profits. They can focus on longer-term growth. Just look at these two economies to see which approach has been more successful,'' said <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> makes headlights and other parts for <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns 19.1 percent of the company <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' shares are worth about $ 1 billion at current market prices. Despite <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' denial, `` many people think it is greenmail,'' <PERSON> Shigeju </PERSON> <PERSON> Kita </PERSON>, general manager in charge of mergers and acquisitions at <ORGANIZATION> Yamaichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, said of <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' stock purchase. Greenmail is a premium paid by a company to buy back stock from an unwanted suitor. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> says he is challenging barriers to foreign investment in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and many Americans are cheering him on. `` I am concerned that American investors do n't have the same access in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> as Japanese have in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said he could not judge how open or closed the Japanese market was until he saw the results of his present enterprise. But he added that `` people in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> are watching this carefully. ... Japan-bashers ... will come to the surface pretty quick'' if they think that an American company is being unfairly treated in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> told the American Chamber audience he was considering running for governor of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Later, he told reporters that the <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> deal `` was not done with political motives in mind, but I've had people suggest it might be an advantage in a political race.''

 Stock prices pushed ahead today, getting a little more mileage out of the rally that has carried the market to its highest levels since the crash of 1987. Analysts said stocks have drawn support in recent days from spreading hopes that inflationary pressures might be easing and interest rates were turning downward. Inflation figures for March, unlike those for the two previous months, contained no unpleasant surprises that seemed likely to prompt the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to tighten credit further. Signs of a slowing economy also raise some new worries for investors. For one thing, some observers suggest, they could lead to heightened concern about the possibility of a recession. However, brokers said, any such fears were countered today by strong earnings reports from several prominent companies.

<HEAD>Reports Decrease In First-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLAYTON, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that it had a 12 percent decrease in first-quarter net earnings, due in part to declining earnings in its military aircraft operation. Net earnings for the first quarter of 1989 were $ 75.4 million, or $ 1.81 a share, on revenue of $ 2.36 billion, compared with net earnings of $ 85.7 million, or $ 2.04 a share, on revenue of $ 2.42 billion during the same period last year. The decline in operating earnings in the military aircraft segment resulted from lower volume and a reduction of the earnings rate in the F-16 program, said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pace </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive. Those trends reflected lower margins on recent contract awards as well as cost increases resulting from simultaneous production of more than 20 versions of the aircraft, he said. Pace said that improved manufacturing techniques and cost containments continued to raise the peformance level of the company's land systems business. He also cited increasing demand for business jets as contributing to a favorable performance in the general aviation business. Among the contracts the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis-based </LOCATION> company won during the first quarter was for the lead ship construction for the Seawolf class of attack submarines and for the upgrading of the M1A1 <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> tank. The company also signed an agreement with <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>, valued at about $ 2 billion over the next six years, for production of fuselages for the MD-11 aircraft.

<HEAD>Big First-Quarter Profit Drop Blamed on Earlier Tax Benefit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s profit plunged in the first quarter, but the decline was attributed to a huge one-time tax benefit in the comparable quarter a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>, which has been rocked by a series of allegations of overbilling and a defense fraud indictment, said Wednesday its first-quarter profit fell to $ 9.7 million, or 21 cents a share, from $ 139.6 million, or $ 2.97 a share in the first quarter of 1988. The difference was the result of a one-time gain of $ 135.1 million in the earlier quarter, when the company took advantage of a law that allowed it to defer payment of taxes in earlier years until the new, lower corporate tax rate took effect. Without the tax benefit, earnings in 1988's first quarter would have been $ 4.5 million, or less than half of this year's first-quarter income <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>'s sales in the first quarter were $ 1.28 billion, down 7 percent from $ 1.37 billion a year earlier. The company also took a charge against profits of $ 26 million for unplanned research and development expenses on an electronic defense system for the F-15 fighter jet. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> made a similar provision in the fourth quarter of last year for development of the system, called the ALQ-135, but did n't reveal the amount of the write-off for that quarter Overall sales declined for several reasons: Less Pentagon money for research and development of the B-2 stealth bomber, which is moving into production; fewer MX missile sales; and fewer deliveries of fuselages for the FA-18 Hornet fighter, which is built by <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. The sales declines were partly offset by an increase in deliveries of 747 airliner fuselages to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> has been the target of several lawsuits by employee `` whistleblowers'' who allege the company overcharged the government on various projects The corporation and five present and former employees were charged this month with conspiracy and fraud in an alleged scheme to fake tests on a device used to guide cruise missiles. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> denies any wrongdoing.

 <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> became the biggest and most profitable Japanese business after the government tranformed it from a public monopoly into a private company four years ago. But now <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> faces restructuring and possible dismemberment, partly because of links to one of the worst political scandals in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s postwar history. Critics and former officials blame <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION>'s problems on confusion about whether it really has become private. The government still owns three-quarters of <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION>'s stock, and its employees are subject to the same restrictions as public servants. `` The most serious mistake was the government tried to satisfy everyone, including politicians, government agencies and <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION>'s labor union,'' said <PERSON> Yoichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sando </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a private thinktank `` That left <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> in an ambiguous status of half-public and half-private in the past four years,'' he said. `` <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> was consistently under pressure to fulfil these two contradictory roles.'' <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> appeared to be successfully transforming itself into a competitive company after the government privatized it in April 1985, following trends in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to promote competition in telecommunications. It has has undergone major changes since then, reducing its work force by more than 10 percent and launching many new services. `` We would never be able to make those drastic changes if we remained government-owned,'' <PERSON> Haruo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON>, president and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in an interview. `` The privatization was certainly a major turning point in our company's 43-year history. The privatized <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> became the most profitable company in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> with record earnings of 496.7 billion yen or about $ 3.8 billion in 1987. It was also the most popular company among new university graduates seeking jobs in 1987 and 1988 because of what they saw as its stability and progressive image. But big trouble surfaced when <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION>'s link to a major bribery scandal surfaced last year. It has led to the arrests of former chairman <PERSON> Hisashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinto </PERSON> and three other senior executives since February. Prosecutors are also investigating the company's lobbying practices with politicians, and there is some expectation that <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> will somehow be restructured or broken up. The price of the utility's stock, once the most popular issue on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, has been stuck around 1.5-million-yen a share, or $ 11,360, less than half its peak of 3.18 million yen a share in April 1987. Critics say <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> has been victimized by conflicting interests of politicians and bureaucrats. <PERSON> Hajime </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakayama </PERSON>, a former official of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Posts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION>, which supervises <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION>, said the ministry was under strong pressure to deregulate the communication market. But when the ministry suggested breaking up <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> into regional competitors and reducing parliamentary oversight, he said, `` we met with opposition from politicians and government officials who have a large stake in <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION>.'' The company was left in the awkward position of having to compete with other companies while being required to aid the same rivals in the name of fair competition. <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON> said the unclear status sometimes hindered his ability to run the company effectively. `` I am aware we really have no other choice but to let the govenment decide what they will do with us,'' he said. `` But frankly, I wish they would leave us alone and let us run the company on our own, or do n't privatize it at all.'' Critics say the firm's alleged involvement in the bribery affair symbolizes its dilemma. Shinto and other executives were charged with receiving bribes from an information-based conglomerate called Recruit, which leased equipment from <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> and bought two U.S.-made supercomputers from it. But legal experts say the alleged bribes would have been an ordinary business practice if the deal took place between two private companies. The 1985 law that changed <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION>'s status says its workers remain `` semi-public servants'' and prohibits them from receiving money and valuables. After the arrests of the senior officials, <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> employees expressed confusion about their status. Some were surprised that they were still subject to the same laws as politicians and public servants, though they no longer enjoy the privileges of public servants. `` The arrest of the chairman reminded many of us that we are not all that private as we thought we were,'' said <PERSON> Takao </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakajima </PERSON>, a head of the firm's advertising section.

 The dollar bounced back Wednesday from its decline of the previous session, boosted by higher oil prices. Foreign exchange dealers said the rise in the dollar was amplified by purchases by traders who had been betting on its continued decline and had to buy dollars to cover short positions. Oil futures prices spurted to a three-year high Wednesday after a North Sea gas explosion and an industry report that showed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production falling to its lowest level since the 1960s. The rise in oil prices increased inflation fears, raising the possibility that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would tighten credit to stop inflation. Tight credit attracts global investors to dollars. A government inflation report had lowered the dollar on Tuesday by diminishing the likelihood of credit-tightening by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>. Wednesday's higher oil prices lowered the Japanese yen against the dollar because <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> depends on imported oil. The yen was also hurt by an unfounded rumor that Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> had resigned, according to <PERSON> Nazem </PERSON> <PERSON> Elsabeh </PERSON>, a trader and vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound fell to $ 1.7113 late Wednesday from $ 1.7185 late Tuesday. Later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the pound fell to $ 1.7108 from $ 1.7164. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 131.88 Japanese yen, down from 132.10 yen late Tuesday. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar traded at 132.10 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the dollar rose to 132.58 yen from 131.40 on Wednesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with Tuesday's late rates, included: 1.8623 West German marks, up from 1.8525; 1.6373 Swiss francs, up from 1.6270; 1.1858 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1863; 6.3040 French francs, up from 6.2710; and 1,364.38 Italian lire, up from 1,360.13 Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with Tuesday's rates: 1.8615 West German marks, up from 1.8528; 1.6360 Swiss francs, up from 1.6283; 6.3025 French francs, up from 6.2750; 2.0985 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0935; 1,363.75 Italian lire, down from 1,366.95; and 1.1865 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1848. In the bullion markets, prices were narrowly mixed. Gold closed in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> at $ 384.25 an ounce, down from $ 386.68 late Tuesday. Gold traded at a late bid of $ 383.95 a troy ounce in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, up from $ 383.25 late Tuesday. But the late bid price for gold fell to $ 383.50 an ounce in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> from $ 384.00 late Tuesday. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery fell to $ 383.40 an ounce from $ 383.50 on Wednesday. Later, <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold was bid at $ 382.80 an ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $ 383.10 late Wednesday.

 Higher quarterly profits were reported Wednesday by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and three of its <ORGANIZATION> Baby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> offspring, <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telesis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 594 million, or 55 cents a share, up from $ 492 million, or 46 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $ 8.66 billion from $ 8.39 billion a year earlier. The company's depreciation expenses declined, boosting profits. But for accounting reasons the company reported an $ 88 million one-time charge against earnings to reflect a change in the method of depreciating assets. Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION> said its earnings rose 1.9 percent to $ 300.8 million, or $ 1.12 a share, on revenues of $ 2.5 billion, from $ 295.1 million, or $ 1.08 a share, on revenue of $ 2.4 billion a year earlier. Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> said its earnings rose 4.3 percent to $ 449.6 million, or 97 cents a share, from $ 430.9 million, or 90 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 5.2 percent to $ 3.37 billion from $ 3.2 billion a year earlier. However, <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings would have fallen to about $ 404 million if not for one-time factors, the company said. San Francisco-based <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telesis </ORGANIZATION>, one of the seven so-called Baby Bells created in 1984 by the breakup of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>, reported first-quarter earnings of $ 317 million, or 76 cents per share, up 5.7 percent from $ 300 million, or 71 cents, in the first quarter of 1988. <ORGANIZATION> PacTel </ORGANIZATION>'s revenues for the period increased to $ 2.34 billion, 1.5 percent more than the $ 2.3 billion reported for the same quarter last year.

<HEAD>First Quarter Earnings Up at Two Banks</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorp </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, two of the nation's largest bank holding companies, reported Wednesday that their first-quarter profits rose over a year ago. First Interstate, based in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said it earned $ 132.2 million, or $ 2.81 a share, for the three months ended March 31, up 29 percent from $ 102.6 million, or $ 2.20 a share, in 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said net income totaled $ 89 million, or $ 1.23 per share, up 6 percent from earnings of $ 84 million, or $ 1.17 a share, last year. <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> attributed its higher earnings partly to a $ 21.8 million tax benefit and an accounting change that added $ 16.1 million. In the comparable quarter for 1988, a tax benefit boosted profit by $ 15 million. Net interest income in the first quarter rose to $ 636.8 million from $ 564.7 million a year ago. Non-interest income climbed to $ 259.9 million from $ 238.9 million a year earlier. Non-interest expense was $ 605.3 million, up from $ 580.1 million a year ago. First Interstate's <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> subsidiary, formerly <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancshares </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, lost $ 24.3 million in the first quarter, compared to a loss of $ 2.1 million a year ago. The company blamed the loss on continued weakness in the state's economy. But First Interstate banks in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> turned in strong performances and most of the other state banks reported gains, said <PERSON> J.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinola </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepanian </PERSON> said he was pleased with the latest earnings report, `` especially considering last year's particularly strong first quarter. `` This year's improvement includes no special items and reflects higher net interest revenue,'' he said in a statement. Consolidated net interest revenue totaled $ 322 million, an 11 percent increase over $ 292 million in 1988. Non-interest income for the quarter was $ 161 million, compared with $ 176 million in 1988. Non-interest expense was $ 297 million, a 3 percent increase over 1988.

Earning assets are amounts owed <ORGANIZATION> GMAC </ORGANIZATION> on which it receives interest. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the aviation and electronics arm, said net income fell to $ 201.1 million, or 51 cents a share of <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> Class H common stock, from $ 252 billion, or 63 cents a share in the first quarter of 1988. The 1988 period's earnings were inflated by 13 cents a share by the sale of part of <ORGANIZATION> GMHE </ORGANIZATION>'s stock in <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avionics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and 5 cents a share by an accounting change at <ORGANIZATION> GMHE </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Delco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> GMHE </ORGANIZATION>'s revenues rose 12.7 percent to $ 3.01 billion for the quarter from $ 2.67 billion in the year-earlier period, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the data processing subsidiary, said new insurance, financial, commercial and government data-processing contracts helped raise net income 12 percent.

 Stock prices kept climbing Wednesday, getting a little more mileage out of the rally that has carried the market to its highest levels since the crash of 1987. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.51 to 2,386.91, bringing its gain over the past four sessions to 90.91 points. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 827 up, 634 down and 524 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 191.51 million shares, down from 208.65 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 227.87 million shares. Analysts said stocks have drawn support in recent days from spreading hopes that inflationary pressures might be easing and interest rates were turning downward. Inflation figures for March, unlike those for the two previous months, contained no unpleasant surprises that seemed likely to prompt the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to tighten credit further. Signs of a slowing economy also raise some new worries for investors. For one thing, some observers suggest, they could lead to heightened concern about the possibility of a recession. However, brokers said, any such fears were countered Wednesday by strong earnings reports from several prominent companies. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> rose -RRB- to 33 -LCB-. The company reported a 20.6 percent increase in its first quarter earnings, and said it had a good chance to keep up that pace. <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>, which also posted a strong first-quarter earnings gain, climbed 2 -RCB- to 125 -LRB-. Other gainers among the blue chips included <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION>, up ~ at 109 -RRB-; <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Manufacturing, up -RCB- at 70 -RCB-; <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, up -RCB- at 95 |, and <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION>, up \ at 45 <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> picked up 1 -LCB- to 60 on a strong quarterly earnings report. <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION>, among the volume leaders in the over-the-counter market, rose 1 | to 54 The company reported earnings for the fiscal quarter ended March 31 of 73 cents a share, up from 67 cents in the comparable period a year earlier.

As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market increased $ 9.71 billion, or 0.32 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks added .57 to 171.70. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index rose 1.43 to 354.30, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.13 at 307.15.

<HEAD>Merc Proposes to Ban Most `Dual Trading' Improve Surveillance, Auditing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One of the biggest futures markets proposed sweeping changes Wednesday that would double surveillance and limit a controversial trading practice in response to a federal fraud probe that has tainted <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s financial industry. Many of the recommendations contained in a report by the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to Review Trading Practices were under consideration earlier, said <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON>, vice chairman of the committee. `` But the time frame was compressed as a result of the investigation,'' <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON> told a news confererence where the proposals were unveiled. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Geldermann </PERSON>, chairman of the special committee, said the public perception of the exchange has suffered in the three months since disclosure of the undercover <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> probe. He said it was important to release the recommendations to maintain investor confidence. `` The failure to respond quickly would have shown a lack of leadership,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Geldermann </ORGANIZATION>, who also is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> The recommendations will be submitted to that board for a decision expected within 60 days. The most imporant restriction would be limits on dual trading, a controversial practice, enables a trader to trade his own account at the same time he handles customers' accounts. While the practice is allowed by many financial exchanges, many consider it susceptible to abuse because it allows unscrupulous traders to allocate profitable deals to their own accounts and dump losing trades on customers. The nine-member committee was appointed in late January, following disclosures that the federal government was investigating allegations involving the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. The federal probe concerns allegations that as many as 100 brokers at the two sprawling exchanges systematically cheated investors out of millions of dollars through illegal trading practices. No indictments have been announced yet, but as many as 200 subpeonas reportedly have been issued to traders and firms at the exchanges. Some market experts viewed the formation of the special committee as part of the futures industry's effort to hold the line against further government regulation, which it historically has rejected as cumbersome and unneeded. <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON> said he made the rounds Tuesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and carried the committee's reports to the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the federal agency charged with regulating the industry, as well as key <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> members with agriculture or industry oversight responsibilities. `` It was received extremely favorably by everyone ... No one mentioned anything beyond what we were saying,'' he added. Proponents argue that dual trading increases the amount of buyers and sellers because traders can continue doing business when they do n't have outside orders. But the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> committee, with few exceptions, recommended dual trading be banned from futures contracts in cases where market volume already is substantial. The panel also recommended the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>'s full-time floor surveillance team be doubled from four to eight staff members and adopt specific guidelines _ with penalties ranging from a 30-day trading suspension to expulsion _ for rule violations involving financial injury to public customers. Among other recommendations: _ More extensive screening of membership applicants _ Members of a broker association should not be allowed to execute personal trades against orders by members of the broker group _ Addition of one non-Merc member to all major disciplinary committees `` The criticism is that we're too clubby,'' said <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON>. `` This would enable the public to view the process and see we are open-handed.'' _ Daily computerized trade information for members covering all activity from the previous day Asked whether he expected the recommendations to stave off further government intervention into industry business, <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON> replied, `` Self-regulation requires that you deserve self-regulation. And in order to deserve it, you must prove that you're responsible.''

<HEAD>Corn, Soybeans Slide On Rain Forecasts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Prices for corn and soybeans to be harvested this fall fell sharply Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> on forecasts for rain later this week in the western Corn Belt, a key growing area hit hard by last summer's drought. Wheat futures prices rose due to persistent dryness in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, where the winter wheat crop already has sustained severe damage. On other markets, oil futures posted steep gains, livestock and meat futures prices tumbled and precious metals were slightly lower. Wheat settled unchanged to 4 -RCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in May at $ 4.11 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 2 -LCB- cents to 4 -LCB- cents lower with May at $ 2.73 a bushel; oats were 1 \ cents to 2 -RCB- cents lower with May at $ 1.97 a bushel; soybeans were 3 -LCB- cents to 11 \ cents lower with May at $ 7.45 a `` Welcome to the weather market,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, a New York-based grain specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, referring to the recent volatility in the grain markets. Corn and soybean planting has barely begun but the grain markets are extremely sensitive to weather changes because last year's drought lowered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain stockpiles Another drought year could drain stocks down to critical levels and cause prices to skyrocket. Some private meteorologists who had been predicting dry weather for the rest of this week in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and northwestern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> put more rain into their noon forecasts on Wednesday, prompting heavy selling of corn and soybean contracts. After the close, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> issued a new six-to-10 day forecast calling for above-normal rainfall in the western <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and normal precipitation in the region's central and eastern portions, which could prompt further selling of corn and soybean futures on Thursday. `` The irony is that most experts agree that beyond 72 hours, the degree of accuracy in a forecast drops geometrically,'' <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> said, `` and yet everybody pays attention to those forecasts because there is n't anything else to trade on.'' Unleaded gasoline prices surged on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, leading the crude oil and heating oil markets higher, following Tuesday's <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> report of substantial reductions in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supplies of crude and gasoline. Further buying was spurred by reports that the <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s British subsidiary had advise clients of possible shipment delays for <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> crude oil following the shutdown late Tuesday of a damaged oil platform West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 2 cents to $ 1.10 higher with May at $ 22.61 a barrel; heating oil was .53 cent to .71 cent higher with May at 53.33 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .75 cent to 1.20 cents higher with May at 74.62 cents a gallon. The sharp losses in livestock and meat futures on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> were due more to profit-taking and technical factors than to Wednesday's weaker cash markets, analysts said. Trading activity has grown cautious ahead of Friday's quarterly <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> cattle-on-feed report, which is expected to show first-quarter placements of cattle on feedlots to be 3 percent to 10 percent above the first quarter of 1988. Live cattle settled .10 cent to 1.02 cents lower with June at 70.50 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .57 cent to .97 cent lower with May at 75.55 cents a pound; live hogs were .25 cent to .80 cent lower with June at 45.90 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.05 cents to 1.88 cents lower with May at 31.57 cents a pound. Gold and silver futures prices inched lower on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Investment demand for the metals has fallen following government economic reports that indicate the economy is slowing and inflation is holding steady. Gold settled 10 cents to 60 cents lower with June at $ 387.10 a troy ounce; silver was 1.3 cents to 1.5 cents lower with May at $ 5.765 a troy ounce.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> remained locked on a collision course with the federal judge overseeing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' bankruptcy case by insisting Wednesday that the strike-wracked carrier will be shrunk not sold `` There are a lot of people out there who want to buy <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> for some beads, jelly beans or whatever comes to mind,'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> told a small group of reporters at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office. `` Eastern has to be built back the old-fashioned way ... We do n't think that any sale transaction makes sense.'' That position puts <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> at loggerheads with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON>, who appears poised to put the entire airline up for sale _ including assets held by Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> before <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> acquired it three years ago for about $ 676 million. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON>, who generally refrains from speaking to reporters on pending cases, was unavailable for comment. Furthermore, the 15-member committee representing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s major creditors could be skeptical of <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s plan to reduce <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to 60 percent of its pre-strike size, sources said The committee is scheduled to meet Thursday, but <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boies </PERSON> said the plan wo n't be presented to creditors until next week. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s insistence on holding and shrinking Eastern could be aimed at luring back the airline's rebellious pilots, whose support for the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>' strike has been critical to its success, a union official said. `` His position is to threaten the pilots with ` This is the only airline we're going to have; you'd better jump on the bandwagon,''' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashby </PERSON>, a spokesman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` The pilots are definitely holding ... This is a desperation ploy.'' <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, an attorney for the pilots union, likening the <LOCATION> Lorenzo-Lifland </LOCATION> showdown to `` a shootout at the OK Corral,'' said the `` notion that you can shrink your way to profitability is sheer lunacy.'' There had been speculation that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to sell <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, expressed by its board of directors on Monday, was a negotiating ploy designed to elicit a higher price for the airline, which has been mired in a strike and bankruptcy court proceedings for more than a month. Last week, after the collapse of <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s $ 464 million deal to sell <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to ex-baseball commissioner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> officials said the airline would be sharply reduced. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, who wore a yellow shirt and bright blue tie but no jacket during the informal meeting with reporters, looked less weary than he had at the federal courthouse last week but still showed the toll of the protracted strike and bankruptcy case. He insisted that Eastern will be able to rebuild to a smaller level without the fractious pilots returning to work. The airline will need an estimated 1,500 pilots to run 60 percent of its previous operations. Of the 3,600 or so Eastern pilots, only 200 have crossed picket lines. `` We can train pilots at a very substantial rate,'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said. He disputed the pilots union's claim of a nationwide pilot shortage. Asked whether a sharply reduced Eastern would be viable, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said, `` We believe it -LRB- would be -RRB- but there are no guarantees in this world.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> chief also refuted earlier statements by attorneys for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and the pilots union that another potential buyer had emerged besides <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>, hotelier <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> and takeover strategist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>. `` There is no serious fourth bidder,'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said. He insisted there are no talks currently between his company and potential suitors. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> had called him Tuesday and made it `` very plain that he's out of the deal.''

 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced a 20.6 percent increase in first-quarter profit Wednesday, thrust ahead by an expensive restructuring last year that produced its first annual loss. The phone giant achieved the improved results despite intense competition across its range of businesses, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive, told shareholders at the company's 104th annual meeting `` We're seeing new vigor in our long-distance business and strong growth in international sales of products and services,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. The stock rose 37 -LCB- cents a share to $ 33.50 in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. Shareholders rejected a pair of shareholder proposals on affirmative action, one to strengthen it and one to stop it. Also rejected were proposals to get more information on <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's lobbying and on its involvement in Star Wars defense contracts. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 594 million or 55 cents a share in the first three months of 1989, up from $ 492 million or 46 cents a share a year earlier. Revenue rose 3.2 percent to $ 8.66 billion from $ 8.39 billion a year earlier. Earnings would have risen even more if the company had not adopted a more aggressive method of depreciating the value of its assets. The change cut $ 88 million from first-quarter profits. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 1.67 billion last year, the result of a huge accounting charge that covered the cost of accelerating its transition to modern digital technology. As part of the restructuring, the company said last year it was scrapping outdated analog phone equipment and moving, retiring or laying off 16,000 employees. Although the charge produced a loss last year it is adding to profitability this year by lowering the company's payroll and depreciation expenses. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> declined to predict profits for the rest of the year but said he would not be surprised if they kept up the same pace. `` This is not an aberration, at least based on our business plan.'' <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T is no longer the world's largest company since the 1984 <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> breakup, but it remains the most widely held stock in the country, with 2.6 million shareowners. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> told 2,360 shareholders in Radio City Music Hall that the company was getting closer to being able to raise its quarterly dividend, which has been stuck at 30 cents a share since divestiture. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Toole </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> analyst, predicted the dividend might be raised early next year. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> was elected chairman the night before the 1988 annual meeting in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> following the death a day earlier of Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>'s unexpected death cast a pall over that gathering. `` Aside from the emotional aspect, I feel much more comfortable'' after a year on the job, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> told a news conference. `` I have a good sense of the business, the people, what's important, where we're going.'' In long-distance, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said aggressive advertising and sales promotions, an expanded sales force and increased regulatory flexibility were paying off. Product sales grew 4.5 percent, mainly because of higher international sales of telecommunications network equipment and increases in microelectronic components, sales to the federal government and some computer products. Also, sales of the newly acquired <ORGANIZATION> Paradyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> were included in the results for the first time. Shareholders rejected a proposal by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, a white-supremacist organization, to phase out aspects of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's affirmative action program `` which are directed toward recruiting, employing or promoting individuals from any particular racial or ethnic group. However, 8.1 percent of the shares were voted in favor, entitling the group to resubmit it next year. A proposal by an <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T employee, <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Tillman </PERSON>, to strengthen and provide details on the affirmative action received support from 4.7 percent of the shares, falling below the 6 percent cutoff for resubmission. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T management opposed both proposals but reserved his main criticism for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> one, which he described as an insult to <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T employees.

 The head of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> suggested Wednesday the agency still might pursue action against the head of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and other top executives of the investment firm. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON>, testifying before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, said he expects the agency's enforcement division to `` pursue the activities of all the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> officials who were in responsiblity'' during the time when massive securities violations allegedly were committed. `` It is not unlikely that our investigation will reveal other persons against whom action might be brought,'' <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on finance and telecommunications. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> last week agreed to a settlement of <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> civil charges under which the firm will be subject to close federal monitoring for three years and will restructure its operations and sever ties with its junk bond chief, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, who was indicted on racketeering charges last month. The company also has agreed to plead guilty to six felony charges and pay $ 650 million in fines and penalties in what has become the biggest securities fraud probe in history. Asked by the subcommittee chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., why <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> was allowed to remain as <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief operating officer under the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> settlement, <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> stressed that the agreement requires <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to cooperate in a continuing <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> investigation of activities at the investment He said that under standard <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> procedure, a logical follow-up to the settlement would be for the agency's enforcement division `` to pursue questions of actions by the individuals at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` Your statement that we have decided not to take action is simply not true,'' <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> also questioned whether the environment at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> could change for the better if the firm's chief operating officer stays on. `` That is a question with which we have had some concern,'' <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> acknowledged. `` We have been looking for signs at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> at the top level that there will be a change in culture and we continue to look for signs that there is a change in culture.'' He added that `` the primary and most significant'' change is likely to come with the installment of former <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shad </PERSON> as chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s board. <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said the need for change at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> was primarily in its high-yield junk bond department in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, which <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> had commanded. `` We believe that steps to rework that department will be effective to accomplish that cultural change,'' <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it lost $ 19 million in the first quarter due to increased interest expense and a corporate restructuring. The Cincinnati-based grocery chain's first-quarter results compared with an after-tax profit of $ 40.3 million, or 48 cents a share, in the first quarter of 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> said it recorded the first-quarter loss despite strong sales during the period. Revenue totaled $ 4.5 billion, up from $ 4.3 billion in the comparable 1988 quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> launched a $ 4.6 billion restructuring last fall to fend off takeover threats from two interested parties. The restructuring has included sales of stores and food processing plants and the layoff of 300 headquarters employees. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> officials said operating cash flow from units not being sold by the company totaled $ 192.4 million for the quarter, up 27.3 percent from $ 151.2 million in the year-ago first quarter. <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Everingham </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer, said the company helped its first-quarter results with aggressive marketing programs and by holding down operating costs. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> announced that a $ 250 million divestiture loan it took out as part of its restructuring will be substantially repaid within 45 days upon completion of the previously announced sale of <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s Price Savers wholesale stores unit.

 Although <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has been on strike for nearly seven weeks, some of its flight attendants still seem to be serving. During the recent marathon negotiations in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> between <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> union </LOCATION> officials and ex-baseball commissioner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>'s team, flight attendant representatives seemed to always get stuck ordering food, coffee and sodas for the group, some participants in the talks said. `` As soon as somebody says ` lunch', a flight attendant grabs a pad and starts writing, taking orders,'' said one negotiator, who asked not to be identified. Some union activists say the situation is typical of the treatment accorded the flight attendants, who historically have complained of discrimination. They are considered the easiest employees to replace in an airline strike and therefore the least powerful. The airline's flight attendants had reason to cheer Wednesday, however, when they were told that they would be represented on the Eastern creditors committee. Their union, the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, had been excluded from the creditors panel at the start of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy proceeding while their fellow pilots and Machinists were represented. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> local at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, will be the designated representative and will attend her first committee meeting on Thursday, union sources said.

<DATELINE>EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday its profit rose 5 percent in its latest quarter, largely because of a one-time gain on the sale of a subsidiary. The aerospace company said that sales declines due to the end of production of the B-1B bomber were offset by higher revenue on space shuttle, space station and `` star wars'' programs, as well as gains in the company's electronics and automotive divisions. <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 270.7 million, or $ 1.05 a share, in its second quarter, up from $ 218.4 million, or 81 cents a share, in the second quarter of 1988. Sales for the quarter ended March 31 were $ 3.16 billion, up from $ 3.04 billion a year earlier. Second-quarter results were boosted by a one-time gain of $ 100 million, after taxes, on the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION>'s measurement and flow division, which makes meters and valves, to <ORGANIZATION> BTR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dunlop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> BTR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, the British maker of sports and industrial products. In the comparable quarter in 1988, earnings were increased by a one-time tax adjustment of $ 50 million. In the first half of its fiscal year, <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> recorded a profit of $ 430.7 million, or $ 1.67 a share, up from $ 411.3 million, or $ 1.52 a share, in the first half of 1988. Sales in the firsdt half were $ 6.03 billion, up from $ 5.72 billion a year earlier.

 <ORGANIZATION> Wheeling-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday higher production led to a 1.7 percent decline in its first-quarter profit despite a 9.3 percent rise in sales. The steelmaker said it earned $ 45.8 million, or $ 8.49 per share, in the latest three months compared with $ 46.6 million, or $ 8.68 per share, a year earlier. Quarterly sales rose to $ 287.5 million from $ 263 million in the same period in 1988. The company, based in Wheeling, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said shipments increased to 581,600 tons from 548,100 tons a year earlier A 14.4 percent increase in operating costs reflected additional shipping activity, blast furnace maintenance and purchases of semi-finished steel and raw materials, the company said. Raw steel production declined 2.5 percent. Because it has been operating under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws since April 16, 1985, <ORGANIZATION> Wheeling-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> is not paying interest on most of its debt or bearing the full burden of its pension plans. It is also benefiting from interest income on cash that may be distributed to creditors in its bankruptcy reorganization. <ORGANIZATION> Wheeling-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> made $ 11.1 million in the first quarter and $ 4.5 million a year earlier on its cash balance. Had the company been paying interest on its debt, its quarterly interest costs would have been higher by at least $ 13.5 million this year and $ 12.9 million in 1988, the company said.

 Two diversified tobacco giants, <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, reported higher first-quarter profits Wednesday <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> said its first-quarter profit rose 17.6 percent, boosted by the contribution from <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which it acquired late last year. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, the large cigarette manufacturer that has become a major consumer products company mainly through acquisitions, said its profit totaled $ 590 million, or $ 2.55 a share, in the quarter ended March 31 compared to last year's originally reported figures of $ 502 million, or $ 2.12 a share. The 1988 first quarter results as originally reported did not include the effects of new accounting rules pertaining to income taxes. To conform with a change in the method of accounting for income taxes, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> restated last year's results. Restated, but excluding the effect of the accounting change, net income came to $ 490 million, or $ 2.06 a share in 1988's first quarter. Income amounted to $ 763 million, or $ 3.23 a share, in 1988 after restatement and including the effect of the accounting change. Revenue rose 45.1 percent to $ 10.77 billion in this year's first quarter from $ 7.42 billion a year earlier. <PERSON> Hamish </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' chairman and chief executive officer, said the volume of cigarette sales increased slightly and the company's share of the cigarette market expanded, aided by the introduction of the Alpine brand. Among <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' other cigarette brands are Marlboro, <ORGANIZATION> Virgina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Slims </ORGANIZATION> and Merit. The <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> division of <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> posted higher operating revenue in the first quarter than the comparable combined <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> results for the year earlier. <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> became a subsidiary of <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> in December 1988 and General Foods was acquired in November 1985. Higher unit sales of several prepared and packaged foods under the <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> corporate umbrella contributed to overall revenue growth. These products included <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>' <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> coffee and Kool-Aid powdered beverages and <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>'s Cheez Whiz, Velveeta, and packaged dinners. Other <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> holdings that produced revenue gains were <ORGANIZATION> Oscar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>, including the <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> turkey business, and <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> reported a 14 percent increase in first-quarter earnings, due largely to a strong performance from its tobacco unit The <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, Conn.-based company earned $ 172 million, or $ 1.80 a share, on revenue of $ 3.24 billion in the first quarter, compared with a profit of $ 151 million, or $ 1.40 a share, on revenue of $ 3.13 billion during the same period last year. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION>' chairman and chief executive officer, attributed the record rise in per-share earnings in part to a 17.1-million-share stock buyback, which cut the number of outstanding shares by 11 percent.

 A long-rumored acquisition battle spilled over Wednesday as <ORGANIZATION> Japonica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> disclosed intentions to acquire <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in a letter that asked shareholders to replace the management of the railroad holding company with a slate of its own. `` I guess you could call this hostile,'' <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Foote </PERSON> said. `` Throughout this whole campaign, they have not made an offer to us nor have they indicated they have financing for such a deal. `` Now, they apparently want to become directors so that if they do make an offer, they would be making it to themselves.'' Countered <PERSON> Japonica </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> Spar </PERSON>: `` They had better understand that when a group of quality people make a statement as blunt as this, it should be taken seriously.'' In a letter to shareholders, New York-based <PERSON> Japonica </PERSON> said it is <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION>'s largest shareholder, owning 8.8 percent of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> company's approximately 16.4 million outstanding shares. <PERSON> Japonica </PERSON> said it intends to acquire <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> at a `` substantial premium'' over the $ 31-per-share offer put together by <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> management and the investment group <ORGANIZATION> Gibbons </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Amerongen </PERSON>. That proposal fell through last May. The letter criticizes <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> management for refusing to give <PERSON> Japonica </PERSON> the same consideration it gave its own bid last year. Spar declined to be more specific about whether <PERSON> Japonica </PERSON>'s plans for an acquisition would result from a merger or tender offer or some other arrangement, or how much more than $ 31 per share would be offered. As for financing, he said <PERSON> Japonica </PERSON> was `` evaluating'' several proposals. <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock climbed 37 -LCB- cents Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> to close at $ 40. <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION>'s principal subsidiary is the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates a nine-state, 6,000-mile freight railroad with 8,500 employees. <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> also has real estate holdings and operates Chicago-area commuter rail lines. It earned $ 81 million on revenues of $ 995.4 million last year. The <PERSON> Japonica </PERSON> letter contends <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION>'s board has approved excessive compensation levels and an `` inappropriate'' golden-parachute package for <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION>'s senior management in case of a takeover. <PERSON> Japonica </PERSON> also said it would consider selling <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION>'s real estate, excess equipment and the commuter lines. <PERSON> Japonica </PERSON>'s proposed slate includes <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardesty </PERSON>, former president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Purolator </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, as its chairman-designate. In a letter to shareholders last month, <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmiege </PERSON> urged support for the company's slate at the May 16 stockholders meeting. Analysts attributed a recent runup in the stock to the escalating war of words between <PERSON> Japonica </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> management. In a related development, <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday that it had filed an appeal in the 3rd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> seeking to force <ORGANIZATION> Japonica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> to disclose its plans for <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> and the identity of its investors. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> is incorporated, recently denied <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION>'s request for a preliminary injunction to force <PERSON> Japonica </PERSON> to provide such information. <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> also announced that its directors approved a dividend of 10 cents a share, payable July 14.

 <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, parent company of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, reported Wednesday a 47.7 percent jump in first-quarter profit, partly due to increased traffic as passengers looked for an alternative to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Net earnings were $ 101 million, or $ 1.60 per share, on revenues of $ 2.45 billion during the quarter. That compares with earnings of $ 68.4 million, or $ 1.12 per share, on revenues of $ 1.97 billion in the same quarter last year. The first-quarter 1989 earnings included a $ 14.1 million gain from the sale of certain property rights, the company said. American's load factor at <LOCATION> Raleigh-Durham </LOCATION> airport in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> jumped from 63 percent in last year's first quarter to 71.2 percent this year, while in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, the factor rose from 70.3 to 81.4, <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> said. Both locations were Eastern strongholds. Eastern filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection March 9 after its Machinists union members went on strike, crippling the airline. American's revenue passenger miles, a key industry statistic, rose 9.7 percent in the quarter, from 14.77 million in the year-ago period to 16.2 million.

 Rising interest rates have caught up with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> homeowners and are pinching the pockets of the 12 million households with adjustable-rate mortgages. For many of them, springtime'89 will mean a second annual hike in mortgage payments _ 20 percent over a year ago on average _ since that's when the bulk of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> homes are usually sold and mortgages originated. This season also marks the first real test of interest-sensitive adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs as they're called, in an era of tightening credit. A government report issued earlier this week showed a 5.4 percent drop in housing starts last month, evidence that rising rates are already having a major impact on the economy. Loan delinquencies could follow. `` We have n't seen this before,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Order </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION>. `` ARMs became popular in the early 1980s at the national level after rates started to come down. This is the first period of rising rates.'' Monthly payments on a typical $ 100,000 ARM taken out in April 1988 are likely to rise at least $ 150 starting next month since most ARMs are tied to an index of one-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> notes, which have risen about 2.5 percentage points from a year ago. Interest rates, particularly short-term, have gone up over the past two years in reaction to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to keep a tighter rein on credit to prevent the economy from overheating and keep inflation in check. Economists say they've already seen signs that that strategy is working, and they predict that interest rates will ease by the end of the year. The sharp jump in payments of widely used ARMs will also help to temper economic growth because it will limit many homeowners' discretionary income, they said. `` People will find there's a lot of things they can do without. But they will want to hold onto their most worthwhile possession: their homes,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>. Twenty percent of all the 58 million owner-occupied homes in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are financed with ARMs, or about $ 800 billion of the $ 2.2 trillion in outstanding mortgage debt, according to industry estimates. So far in 1989, ARMs have made up an estimated 55 percent of all mortgages granted. Economists, though, expect that level to decline because short-term rates have risen at a faster clip than longer-term rates, making ARMs far less attractive. The rate on a 30-year fixed-rate conventional mortage averaged 11.09 percent in April, up from 11.03 percent in March, while the initial rate on an ARM averaged 9.40 this month, up from 9.09 percent the previous month. The typical ARM holder is someone who is relatively young and expects to be moving up, as well as on, within a few years. Many people who take out these kind of loans also expect interest rates to be heading south. `` The adjustable-rate mortgage has ... kept the housing market going at reasonably healthy levels for quite some time,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peach </PERSON>, deputy chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. `` Consumers have always been aware of the risks inherent with adjustable-rate mortgages. `` Now the chickens have come home to roost and unfortunately we have seen a worst case scenario for a borrower with an ARM.'' Homeowners who were drawn into the market by the artificially low `` teaser rates'' for the first year have seen the biggest jump in payments. A homeowner who got a $ 100,000 ARM with a teaser rate of 6.5 percent two years ago would have had initial monthly payments of $ 819.46. In 1988 the rate likely went up 2 percentage points to 8.5 percent, lifting the monthly mortgage payments to $ 986.11, or 20 percent from the first year. This year the rate is likely to go up another 2 percentage points to 10.5 percent, lifting the monthly mortgage payments to $ 1,152.78, up about $ 333.33, or 41 percent from the first year. `` Mortgage payments have gone up a fair amount, but I do n't think we're experiencing a crisis in the marketplace,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Sibley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, mortgage company `` I think we have seen a situation where the home-buying public is now much more aware of the risks associated with ARMs.'' He and other lenders say that many consumers have been choosing fixed-rate mortgages, or adjustable loans that convert to a fixed rate mortgage during some period of the loan.
