 Soldiers at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> base at <LOCATION> Guantanamo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, fired two shots Thursday at <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> sentry posts, breaking glass but causing no injuries, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latina </ORGANIZATION> said. The news agency quoted a ministry statement as saying one shot was fired at 10 a.m. EST at sentry post 17, and a second at 1 p.m. at post 18. Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Satterfield </PERSON>, a spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` We received no reports of any such incident.'' Both shots shattered glass in the posts, the agency said in the dispatch, monitored in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The direction indicated the shots were fired from <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> post 13, the agency quoted the note as saying. `` These actions are even more serious and of unpredictable consequences because the two shots hit the guardposts and could have wounded and even assassinated any of the soldiers who were on guard duty,'' the agency quoted the note as saying. The note said the last similar incident was Aug. 21, 1987, when shots were fired from <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> post 18 on a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> observation post. It noted the incident occurred as the country was holding funerals for more than 2,000 Cuban soldiers and civilian technicians killed in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and other foreign conflicts the past 14 years. The ministry said it was not an accident that `` these vulgar and dangerous provocations by <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> soldiers occurred precisely today.''

 State game officials are no dummies, but the same ca n't be said for the deer they used to nab poachers. For the second straight year, officers from the state's Division of Natural Resources used fake deer against hunters who stop along highways to shoot at deer illegally. Last year, one bogus buck in <LOCATION> Braxton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> bamboozled 30 would-be hunters into taking potshots. This year, conservation officers caught 82 shooters at two locations. `` We were hoping that the publicity would act as a deterrent to those hunters who like to cruise the roads looking for deer,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> of the agency's law enforcement division. `` I think it worked. I'm sure it saved some real deer.'' Most of the arrests were for shooting from the road or for trespassing on private property. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> said one decoy was set up in a privately owned field marked with `` No Hunting'' signs. `` We had some guys who would jump out of their cars, run over to the fence and use the signs as gun rests,'' <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> said. Such antics often left conservation officers laughing so hard that they had to pause to compose themselves before moving in to make arrests. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> still chuckles about one incident. `` One car pulled up and four guys came rolling out of it with their guns,'' he said. `` Three of them took up positions outside the fence while the other one sneaked in toward the decoy. `` Finally, the guy got within 30 yards or so of the deer, stood up and fired. He looked at the decoy, still just standing there, and I think he began to get the idea that something was wrong. `` He walked over to the decoy and just reached out and touched it. About that time, we hit the siren and moved in. You've never seen a more dejected or more hang-dog expression on anyone in your life. His buddies were laughing their brains out.''

<HEAD>Study: Even Tiny Amount of Cocaine Cuts Blood Flow to Heart</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Even minuscule amounts of cocaine can constrict the arteries and reduce the flow of blood to the heart, and this may explain how larger doses trigger heart attacks and death, researchers report today. Young, seemingly healthy cocaine abusers sometimes suffer chest pain or heart attacks even though their heart arteries appear to be perfectly normal. Doctors have speculated that the drug causes spasms in blood vessels and temporarily chokes off the flow of blood to heart muscle. `` The importance of our findings was showing that this indeed happens,'' said Dr. <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillis </PERSON>. `` No one has shown it in man before.'' Cotton strips soaked in a cocaine solution are routinely used as a local anesthetic in an estimated 185,000 medical procedures in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> each year. It is especially common during minor nose operations, since it limits bleeding as well as deadens pain. In their experiment on 45 people, doctors tested cocaine's effects on the heart when volunteers received doses that were about two-thirds the amount used for anesthesia They got between 150 and 180 milligrams of cocaine. By contrast, people who abuse cocaine typically take one gram, or six times this much. `` Even that small dose caused coronary blood flow to fall by about 15 to 20 percent,'' said <PERSON> Hillis </PERSON>. `` One can extrapolate from that to say that in all probability a much larger dose would in some people cause a very profound fall in blood flow.'' The study, conducted by <PERSON> Hillis </PERSON> and colleagues at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. <PERSON> Hillis </PERSON> said that despite the finding, the medical use of cocaine as a painkiller is safe. The volunteers showed no sign in their hearts of ischemia, or oxygen starvation. <PERSON> Hillis </PERSON> said that some people's heart arteries respond much more dramatically than others' to the potential hazards of cocaine. In his study, he said, the reduction in blood flow ranged from 5 percent to about 40 percent. He said these individual differences may explain why some people have heart attacks or die from cocaine abuse, while most do not. In an accompanying editorial, Drs. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Isner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Saurabh </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chokshi </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elizabeth </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> noted that during the past year, the number of emergency room visits for cocaine-related problems has increased fivefold. `` While laboratory studies offer increase insight into the fundamental effects of cocaine,'' they wrote, `` the history of this ancient drug grows progressively more depressing.'' They said that at least 58 cases of cocaine-related heart attacks have been described in medical journals. Among highly publicized cases was the 1986 death of college basketball star <PERSON> Len </PERSON> <PERSON> Bias </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hillis </PERSON> said cocaine stimulates the body's production of adrenaline and other hormones. These trigger the blood vessels to narrow so that less oxygen-carrying blood can get through. At the same time, the drug increases the heart's need for oxygen by boosting the heart rate.

<HEAD>Study Shows Higher Cancer Risk With Infrequent Pap Smears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cervical cancer risks increase dramatically for women who fail to get Pap smear tests at least every two years, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> scientists report in a study released today. Women who get Pap smears only every three years run a risk that is 3.9 times greater that cervical cancer will go undetected than women who have the test annually, according to the study published in the professional journal Obstetrics and Gynecology. The study said the risks increase as the between-test interval increases and that for women who have no Pap tests for 10 years or longer, the risk increases by 12.3 times. `` The study shows that women should get Pap smears more frequently than every three years,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Chu </PERSON>, one of five physicians who conducted the study at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>. `` The risk of having advanced disease goes way down if the tests are conducted every two years or less.'' <PERSON> Chu </PERSON> said that the more frequent Pap tests lower the cancer risk for all women, no matter what other risk factors, such as smoking or multiple sexual partners, they have in their life. The Pap smear is used in gynecological screening to detect the presence of squamous cell cancer, the most common form of cervical cancer. It can also detect changes in cells that could lead to invasive cancer if not treated _ thus the test can result in therapy that prevents the cancer from developing. To perform a Pap test, doctors collect cells from the mucous membrane of the cervix during a pelvic examination. The cells are stained for laboratory analysis. The procedure, known formally as the <PERSON> Papanicolaou </PERSON> stain test, is named for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papanicolaou </PERSON>, the physician who developed it. Just how frequently such tests should be performed to afford maximum protection has long been a matter of controversy. Some studies have found that significantly elevated risks for cancer occur at test intervals of four years or more. But the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> State researchers said in their study that they found three years seemed to be the critical interval. `` Women with three-year screening intervals had over three times the risk of squamous cells cervical cancer at did other women with annual screening intervals.'' It noted, however, that there was little risk difference between annual and biannual Pap tests. `` We found no difference in the risk of cervical cancer between women screened every year and those screened every two years, suggesting that two-year screening intervals offer the same protection as annual smears,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Shy </PERSON>, lead author of the study. The findings are based on interviews and medical histories of 92 women with advanced cervical cancer, compared with similar data from 178 women without cancer and selected randomly. The ages ranged from 31 to 75. Annual Pap tests are recommended by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Obstetricians </ORGANIZATION> and Gynecologists for women ages 18 and over who are sexually active. After three consecutive tests with normal findings, however, the test often is done at the discretion of the physician. `` There are really no firm guidelines,'' <PERSON> Chu </PERSON> said. `` Our study, though, shows that three years is certainly not the right number of years'' between tests. The study showed that although the Pap test frequency, along with appropriate follow-up treatment, can reduce the risk of squamous cell cancer, the test interval had no effect on other types of cervical cancer. Squamous cell, however, accounts for about 85 percent of all cervical cancers, <PERSON> Chu </PERSON> said. Other researchers conducting the study were Drs. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandelson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Figge </PERSON>. Obstetrics and Gynecology is the professional journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Obstetricians </ORGANIZATION> and Gynecologists.

<HEAD>Tougher Soviet Stance Could Delay Arms Treaty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s toughened stance on submarine-launched cruise missiles could delay completion of a strategic weapons treaty past the summit planned for June, says a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his foreign minister, <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, appeared at the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> summit last weekend to `` walk back'' from a concession they made in September concerning the submarine-launched cruise missiles, or SLCMs, said a second official. Both sources spoke on condition of anonymity. At a September meeting in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> with Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> withdrew Soviet demands that SLCM limits be included in the proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the Soviets would settle for a separate deal, but did not specify whether it must be signed at the same time as the START treaty. At <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, however, the Soviets spelled out new, more stringent conditions for the proposed SLCM accord, and they have been indicating that they want the two deals concluded simultaneously, said the sources. `` In September, they said SLCMs could be dealt with outside the START treaty. But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said ` how can we agree to all these kinds of reductions when SLCMs are out there running free?''' said the official. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also pressed President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to hold naval arms control talks to ban short-range nuclear weapons in the superpower navies, said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rejected <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s suggestion as `` unacceptable to us because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is a naval power. We depend upon the seas for contact with all of our allies and with other continents of the world,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> concentrated on the issue of tactical nuclear weapons, while <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> dealt in greater detail with the SLCM question in a separate meeting with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, said one of the sources. The senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said that as a result of the conflicting signals from <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>: `` I do n't know where we are. But SLCMs is a major issue.'' The new Soviet position helps explain the sudden pessimism of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials who went to <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> hoping to conclude START in time for the summit scheduled for the last two weeks of June in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but left the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> saying it could take longer. Both leaders said before the summit that a START deal was possible by September, and at <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> they announced that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> would travel to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> next month to continue work on the treaty, which would cut long-range superpower arsenals by 30 percent to 50 percent, to 6,000 warheads apiece. So far, the Soviets have not put forward a comprehensive proposal linking SLCMs and tactical nuclear weapons, or spelling out the scope of the issues they want covered in naval arms control talks. But at <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviets </ORGANIZATION> wanted the SLCM issue included in a naval arms control treaty, that they wanted tough verification rules and they wanted to curb conventional and nuclear warheads, said one source. The Soviets have been pushing similar conditions at the START talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, and also have given `` indications that they want START and a naval treaty at the same time. They did n't say that specifically at <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>,'' said the source. One official described <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s statements at <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> as a `` hardening of the Soviet position.'' Another called it a `` walk back.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> illustrated his concern over the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> by giving <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a map of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval bases, deployments and maneuvers around the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In rejecting <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s argument, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> maintained that `` the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is a land-based power. But the navy is crucial to us in terms of maintaining all of our commitments around the world, maintaining open sea lanes and commercial lanes around the world.'' In Pentagon and other assessments, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is considered to be mightier than its Soviet counterpart, having for example more aircraft carriers. At the joint presidential news conference concluding the summit, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> staked out their basic positions on naval arms control, although neither went into detail. `` The time has come when we should begin discussing naval forces,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied, `` I'm disinclined to think that this is an area where we will have immediate progress.''

<HEAD>Cold War Drying Up Conservative Coffers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With the Cold War thaw, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s right wing is having a tougher time attracting troops and money to its conservative causes _ prompting a search for new issues to replace the Soviet menace `` Saber rattling and the sort of hard-line anti-communism that have held our coalition together are not going to be as convincing arguments with the voters, not when you have a majority of the voters thinking the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> merely seeks peace like we do,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, a Republican political consultant. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON>, who built a political and financial empire based on mail-order fund-raising among conservatives, says he's replacing anti-communism with attacks on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as the centerpiece of his new appeals for dollars `` I plan to make the imperial <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> my No. 1 issue for the foreseeable future,'' <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON> said. `` Whether it's going to catch on as the No. 1 issue, I do n't know.'' Not all conservatives have begun such wholesale rethinking, however. Most prominent among them was Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who offered a highly skeptical assessment of the Soviets in an interview published after last weekend's summit between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` I do n't think they've changed much in foreign policy,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. In a subsequent interview with <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> newspaper editors, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> tempered his earlier comments by saying he should have referred to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as an authoritarian rather than totalitarian state. National security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> rejected suggestions there was a marked difference in the views of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. He said that there may be a `` difference of perspective, but there's no difference in the substance of the policies we're pursuing. Sen. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON>, R-Wyo., a leading <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hawk, disputed the notion that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s `` perestroika'' reforms and the moves toward democracy in the Soviet bloc nations of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> have resulted in a lessening of Cold War concerns by American voters `` I do n't think the millennia has arrived, and I do n't think the polls show the public thinks the millennia has arrived,'' <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON> said. He is a leader of conservative efforts to oppose defense cuts attributable to the lessening of superpower tensions. He is opposing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration acceptance of modest cuts in defense spending. But Wallop acknowledges that in the wake of changes in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> summit, `` it's going to require some leadership to maintain some perspective in the public mind'' in support of the conservative agenda. The opening of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall and other rapid, revolutionary changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are only the latest blows to conservatives' ability to rally around Cold War worries. As conservatives have seen their presidential candidates win three consecutive elections and much of their agenda enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, some of their leading organizations have faced a decline in fund-raising and dues-paying membership. As they succeed, some of the fire goes out of the fight. `` Our members came on because of defense and foreign policy issues _ anti-communism issues,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. `` The fear and loathing is just not at the same level of intensity it was in recent years. ... You do n't expand your membership pool by just declaring victory.'' Most of the conservative leaders say they believe there is still a good case to be made for maintaining tough defense and anti-communism positions. Their problem is most voters are n't as concerned as before. `` I find this all a very sorry state of affairs,'' laments Stone. The <ORGANIZATION> ACU </ORGANIZATION> illustrates the problem encountered by many conservative groups. Its donor list has fallen from a high of 750,000 donors a decade ago to about 60,000 today. Others, such as the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, have sold assets and cut back programs. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Keene </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> ACU </ORGANIZATION>, said his group is `` in an assessment phase,'' and considering other issues. And conservative leaders say there are many other ones, including opposing `` Latin communism,'' as <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> calls it, in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and even that favorite from 11 years ago, maintaining control of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. `` I do n't see any perestroika south of the border,'' <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said. Other potential fighting issues eyed by conservative fund-raisers are opposing abortion, pushing conservative social issues before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, fighting taxes, and opposing liberals on the spending at home of any savings accruing from peace abroad. `` The center of gravity of the conservative movement will shift,'' said <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>. `` I think the tax issue is a critical issue, and the disposition of the ` peace dividend' will ignite the usual liberal-conservative fight.'' Wallop, while insisting the Cold War causes will still work, acknowledges that rapid changes in the face of communism will force conservatives _ and liberals _ to change their methods. `` It's made it different. It's made it different for the other side, too,'' Wallop said. `` The will begin to find ways to spend the defense savings. They've got a pile of new thinking to do also. All of us do.''

In November 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Gucci </ORGANIZATION> was given a one-year suspended prison term and a fine of $ 760 after being convicted of tax fraud. He also was ordered to pay inheritance tax on shares of <ORGANIZATION> Gucci </ORGANIZATION> he had received from his father, <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON>.

The lower court said <ORGANIZATION> Gucci </ORGANIZATION> was trying to evade inheritance taxes. But the appeals court ruled Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> Gucci </ORGANIZATION> and six others accused with him did n't commit the crime. <ORGANIZATION> Gucci </ORGANIZATION> was named company chairman in May after the lower court had handed back his 50 percent shareholding despite his conviction. He is the great-grandson of <ORGANIZATION> Guccio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gucci </ORGANIZATION>, who founded the company in 1922.

<HEAD>Gene for Brain Protein Found, Could Lead to Better Stroke Treatment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scientists reported today they have discovered a gene for a protein that helps govern brain cell communication, a potential step toward new treatments for stroke and severe head injury. Further work also may help explain how the brain learns and remembers, scientists said. `` This discovery is extremely important,'' commented <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, whose editorial appears with the study in the British journal Nature. The work is the first finding of a gene that tells brain cells how to make a protein called a glutamate receptor. When this receptor senses a natural substance called glutamate outside a brain cell, it makes the cell more prone to fire off messages to neighboring brain cells. In this way, the receptor acts as a fundamental regulator of brain cell communication. The newfound gene is for one type of glutamate receptor, but it can be used to find genes for the other types, said study co-author <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinemann </PERSON>. Finding the gene is a first step toward studying a receptor's structure and behavior. Eventually, glutamate receptor studies may lead to development of drugs that limit brain damage from strokes, head injury or repeated seizures, and to new understanding about learning and memory, the scientists said. <PERSON> Heinemann </PERSON> and colleagues at the <ORGANIZATION> Salk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> report that they isolated key portions of a rat glutamate receptor gene. The same issue of Nature carries reports of similar findings in frogs and chicks by scientists at <LOCATION> Salk </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Weizmann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rehovot </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In a telephone interview, <PERSON> Heinemann </PERSON> said his group went on to isolate the entire gene. Finding the human counterparts of rat glutamate receptor genes for further research should be relatively easy, he said. He said he hopes the work will lead to finding the gene for another type of glutamate receptor, called the <ORGANIZATION> NMDA </ORGANIZATION> receptor because it binds to a man-made chemical called N-methyl-D-aspartate. The NMDA receptor plays a role in a phenomenon called excitotoxicity, in which brain cells are fatally overstimulated after a stroke, repeated epileptic seizures or a severe blow to the head, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said. By analyzing and experimenting with the NMDA receptor, researchers may be able to develop drugs that block the process and so limit brain damage, he said. The NMDA receptor also triggers a process called long-term potentiation, a strengthening of communication links between certain brain cells that is thought to underlie some forms of memory and learning. So studying the receptor may illuminate brain function in those tasks, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said. Such studies might one day lead to treatments for people with learning or memory disorders, <PERSON> Heinemann </PERSON> speculated. Scientists have been unable to study details of the <ORGANIZATION> NMDA </ORGANIZATION> receptor because, until now, they had not found any glutamate receptor gene to guide the search for the NMDA receptor gene, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said. The new work `` gives us the right gene family, we think,'' he said. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, cautioned that the study does not guarantee discovery of a gene for the <ORGANIZATION> NMDA </ORGANIZATION> receptor, although it probably increases the chances.

 Sometimes overlooked in the excitement of the political upheaval in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is an increase in nationalism and racism along with the new climate of freedom. In the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, there are signs of nationalism and anti-Semitism that suggest the four decades of Communist rule suppressed traditional hatreds instead of eradicating them. Since <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> allowed more openess and lifted iron controls on dissent, ethnic and racial hatreds have resurfaced in Moslem Central <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> republics of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Ethnic violence there has killed more than 300 people. <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> are in conflict over the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region and the Baltic republics are gripped by growing nationalist sentiment. Writing in the current issue of Foreign Affairs, <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON> says that although communism `` proclaimed itself to be a doctrine of internationalism, communism in fact intensified popular nationalist passions.'' The former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> national security adviser noted that while <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> are the most ethnically cohesive countries in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> are diverse societies and both <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> have substantial national minorities. `` Moreover, all these states have borders that are potentially subject to revisionist aspirations on the part of their neighbors,'' he wrote. In the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, activity by <PERSON> Pamyat </PERSON>, a nationalist Russian society, also has picked up in this new era. Pamyat, with its extremist, xenophobic outlook, is operating openly in a number of major <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> cities. In <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, Soviet artist <PERSON> Tanya </PERSON> <PERSON> Loskutova </PERSON> said in a recent interview that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s campaign of openness had succeeded in unearthing hatreds that had lurked under the surface for decades. `` Anti-Semitism has become much more obvious, because there is now a great opportunity to spit out the dirt that people had inside,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Loskutova </PERSON>, a Jew who emigrated in October and hopes to settle in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The sudden removal of constraints on freedom of expression has permitted organizations like Pamyat to step up anti-Jewish campaigns. In <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> too, overt anti-Semitism appears to be more pronounced since the country initiated reforms about two years ago that are meant to transform it into a full democracy. But representatives of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s Jewish community of 60,000 seem to feel the racist sentiment _ expressed through the desecration of synagogues and in anti-Semitic outbursts at soccer matches _ is not on the rise. They say it's just becoming more visible. `` Anti-Semitism has been with us all these four decades, but it was forbidden to discuss it openly,'' Chief <PERSON> Rabbvi </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoener </PERSON> said in an interview. More worrying to Jews is that political reforms have been accompanied by the kind of growing nationalism that in the past has been linked to the persecution of Jews. The popularity of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, a main opposition party that has gained support by exploiting tensions with <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> over <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION> and the fate of ethnic Hungarians in the Romanian territory, is therefore a cause of worry for some Jews. <PERSON> Gyoergy </PERSON> <PERSON> Konrad </PERSON>, a writer of Jewish origin, likes to relate how his mother once told him: `` My boy, be careful, because once they start talking about <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION>, they'll be deporting Jews soon.'' Government figures and the Hungarian media have also raised nationalist themes in an attempt to gain popularity. The result is embarassing some members of Hungarian minority groups living in neighboring countries. `` The media in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> are hurting us here with false reports of a mass autonomy movement in <LOCATION> Slovakia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Andras </PERSON> <PERSON> Szemere </PERSON>, a member of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s 500,000-strong Hungarian minority told a Western visitor to <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION> recently. `` Sure, we have our problems _ all minorities do everywhere _ but right now we're more interested in working with the Czechs and Slovaks and getting rid of the Communists.'' In <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, there have been scattered incidents of anti-Semitism preceding elections that gave the country its first government in four decades not dominated by the Communists. People scribbled the word `` Jew'' on campaign posters of Solidarity activist <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON>, who is not Jewish. There are also reports that prominent Solidarity activist and intellectural <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> was passed over for the Polish premiership because he is Jewish. In <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where decades of isolation have fallen away with the opening of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, fears focus on the importation of racist sentiments. At a meeting with Jewish community leaders Nov. 27, East German security officials contended that leaflets distributed by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s ultra-rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> have appeared with increasing frequence in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since border controls were loosened Nov. 9. `` Since the opening of the borders to the West, a rise in activities of neo-Nazi groups in the direction of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> can be noticed,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency said in a report on the meeting. Even <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, the last bastion of Stalinism in the Soviet bloc, is exploiting some of the unsolved ethnic problems. In an apparent attempt to deflect attention from his own country's economic and human rights record, President <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> recently suggested the return of the former <LOCATION> Bessarabia </LOCATION>, now <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> lost during World War II.

<HEAD>World Beef Trade Undergoing Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The world's beef trade is undergoing rapid changes as production declines in 1989 and production falters in some major countries. One result, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday, is that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is edging ahead of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> as a world-class beef exporter. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports are estimated at 450,000 metric tons, up from 313,000 tons in 1988, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. Exports are expected to rise to about 508,000 tons in 1990. Most of the increase is the result of larger sales to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> under last year's trade liberalization by <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to open the door to more beef and citrus. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>'s total beef and veal exports, meanwhile, are estimated at 439,000 tons in 1989 and 368,000 tons in 1990. Production rose this year as drought forced more cattle to slaughter. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports of beef, which reached 1.1 million tons in 1988, are expected to decline this year to around 990,000 tons, the report said. The decrease is the result of smaller shipments from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, where production is down and more meat was diverted to the lucrative Japanese market. The report said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef imports in 1990 are likely to decline slightly, to around 970,000 tons, as <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> continues exporting to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef exports grew at a faster rate than those of the other five countries during the 1980s, rising from sixth to fourth position by 1988,'' the report said. `` In 1989, it is expected that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will surpass <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> to become the third largest beef exporter in the world.'' The top six beef exporters in 1989 are: <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, 823,000 tons; the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, 759,000; <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, 450,000; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, 439,000; <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, 370,000; and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, 350,000. Overall, global beef and veal production is expected to decline this year to about 45.2 million metric tons from 45.3 million tons in 1988, the report said. Much of the decease occurred in the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. The situation in the major beef producing countries is watched closely by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> trade analysts and livestock producers, particularly conditions in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. Cattle herds are expected to increase in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> to about 25.3 million head by 1991 from 24.3 million at the beginning of 1989, the report said. `` Dampening a more rapid increase in the herd size is an attractive wool market and expansion in the sheep industry,'' the report said. `` Without this competition for resources, total cattle numbers could increase more rapidly.'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, drought forced cattle slaughter to about 3.3 million head this year from 3.1 million in 1988. But slaughter may decline to around 2.8 million head in 1990, the report said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says it will soon pay wheat and barley producers about $ 175 million in `` deficiency'' payments for participating in the government's 1989 acreage program. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Bjerke </PERSON>, executive vice president of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday that the payments to wheat and barley farmers will be made in cash through local offices of the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Wheat payments will total about $ 168 million and barley $ 7 million. No payments will be made for 1989 oats. The payments will include a deduction for advance payments earlier this year. Deficiency payments are made to help make up the difference between a target price and the higher of the price support loan rate or a five-month market price average. For example, the target price for wheat this year is $ 4.10 per bushel and the basic loan rate is $ 2.57 per bushel. The market price average for five months was $ 3.78 per bushel. Thus, the deficiency payment rate would be 32 cents per bushel, the difference between the target and the market price. An advance of 25 cents per bushel was made, so farmers will get 7 cents per bushel at final settlement.

 A reduction in the use of wheat as animal feed is partly responsible for a sharp jump in global corn trade, says the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. In the last four years, world corn shipments have increased an estimated 28 percent, the largest increase since the late 1970s, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday in a report. `` There has been some worldwide step-up in animal feeding, particularly in the -LRB- <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> -RRB- and major East Asian markets,'' the report said. `` But, in the last two years, an additional reason for the sharp expansion ... is the reduced use of wheat for feed, caused by relatively low global wheat supplies.'' As a result, wheat has become more expensive in relation to the livestock feeding value of corn. Further, the report said, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn exports have nearly doubled in the last few years, while exports of other foreign suppliers have dropped by one-third, due to `` shifts to more profitable crops like oilseeds, increased domestic utilization'' and poor crops. `` The net result is that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> now provides nearly 80 percent of the world's corn export needs, up dramatically from just a few years ago,'' the report said.

 <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> called his mother's attempt to wrest control of his estate vindictive, and his lawyer said allegations in her court request may damage the actor's career. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, 21, and attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wake </PERSON> responded Wednesday to <PERSON> Edmonia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s statements in court documents asserting her son was incapable of handling his $ 6 million fortune. `` My mother's latest legal action obviously stems from her frustration at not being able to control my life,'' said <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, star of the old `` Diff ` rent Strokes'' TV Mrs. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s conservatorship petition, filed Monday, said his deteriorating physical and mental condition puts him at `` significant risk of financial exploitation.'' `` The allegations upon which <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s petition is based are simply not true,'' said Wake. `` This sort of tactic will only backfire because it will expose <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>'s parents to additional liability for malicious prosecution. `` The potential damage to <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>'s career is enormous, and this sort of accusation can be extremely harmful even though it has no foundation whatsoever.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> asked that a conservator be appointed for her son and that <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> be placed in control of assets that include $ 6 million in property and annual income of $ 750,000.

<HEAD>How Canada's Worst Mass Murder Unfolded</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Canada-Shooting</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The first call from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> came into the city's emergency 911 phone line in late afternoon. `` There is a hostage-taking, there is gunfire and there are lots of people wounded,'' police quoted the caller as saying. It was the beginning of what may be the worst mass shooting in Canadian history. When it was over, 14 women had been killed, the gunman had committed suicide, and a dozen other people had been rushed to hospital operating rooms. Based on police and eyewitness accounts, the drama began as students were ending their last classes of the term. About 4:30 p.m., a man thought to be in his twenties and dressed in hunting garb entered the cafeteria on the first floor of the university's engineering building and opened fire with what police believe was a .22 - caliber rifle, killing three The gunman then went up to the second floor and walked into a packed classroom, where he ordered the men into one corner of the room and the women into another. Several of the students, who had been making oral presentations on the final day of classes before exams, said later they thought it was a joke. But the gunman fired a shot into the wall, and they quickly followed his instructions. He told the men to leave. They did so, and police said the gunman screamed before opening fire on the women: `` You're all a bunch of feminists.'' Six slain women were later found in the classroom. On the same floor, he killed a woman in an administration office. Then he climbed to the third floor, where he shot four more women in the corridor. `` It was a human hunt and we were the quarry,'' said one witness quoted by Canadian Press. `` He was clearly gunning for the women,'' said another student. He continued up to the fourth and fifth floors, shooting and wounding both men and women. Then, police say, he returned to the third floor and turned the gun on himself. One police officer who was called to the scene discovered his daughter was among the dead.

The package was delivered even though it was addressed to `` The Millionaire <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>'' in `` <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION>'' It came from a young <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> woman who had read news reports about the 32-year-old benefactor's efforts to help residents in his adopted city of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> start their own businesses. `` As a sign that a new time begins, I send you a little part of the original <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall _ a sign that people should come together and help each other in peace, love and harmony,'' the woman wrote in asking <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> to finance her health-related studies. Appeals have poured in by the thousands, said <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>. He says his life has changed dramatically in the six weeks since he placed a classified ad in local newspapers offering to bankroll first-time entrepreneurs and provide them with office space and business advice. Enthusiasm and hard work were the traits the community college dropout from a blue-collar <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> suburb sought in examining the flood of applicants before selecting 15 beneficiaries of his interest-free loans. `` These were people who did n't need a push,'' he said. `` They had the enthusiasm. They just needed the guidance.'' After writing checks totaling more than $ 220,000 and wondering aloud how he will pay his next mortgage payment on the apartment house where he lives and works, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> has a standard reply to the unending pleas: `` I'm broke. I'm out of money.'' Undaunted, applicants often ask <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> to put their names on a waiting list for any future largesse. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> acknowledged that, though he may be strapped for cash, he probably remains a millionaire on paper. That's because of the appreciation in value of real estate he accumulated in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> as his career as a computer salesman blossomed. He resigned his lucrative sales job last spring out of boredom and invested in a computer company in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. He then looked at job possibilities in the area, found nothing of interest, and decided to use his business talents to help others. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> insists he was `` just an average guy'' before his newspaper ad made him an international celebrity and propelled him into 16-hour workdays. Recipients of <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>'s seed money include several welfare recipients, a recently discharged serviceman and an ex-convict trying to earn a living as an artist. The start-up money has ranged from as little as $ 200 for supplies and equipment to help a young woman begin a cleaning business to $ 100,000 to publish the comic book artist's work. Form months, 23-year-old <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> wanted to open the cleaning business to get off welfare, but could n't afford a vacuum cleaner or other supplies. So she answered <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>'s ad and he helped her buy the equipment. But she admits to being leery after first reading the ad: `` I thought maybe it was a guy who wanted to kidnap people and sell children, so I made sure not to bring my daughter.'' <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, who embarked on the project three months after his arrival in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, said the role of benefactor is a weighty burden. `` A lot of people do n't realize this but it's a big responsibility when you're dealing with people's dreams,'' he said. `` They're looking up to you as an answer. It's frightening.'' <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Branscomb </PERSON>, associate director of the <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION>, said people applying to <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> should be cautious because they are vulnerable when they start a business, even if it is with someone else's money. `` They could put in the time and effort and blood, sweat and tears and lose the whole kit and caboodle,'' she said.

 The first family's Christmas tree, a Pennsylvania-grown Fraser Fir, is at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, arriving in a carriage drawn by two Clydesdale horses. The 18-foot tree will sit in the <LOCATION> Blue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Room </LOCATION>, decorated with `` soft sculptures depicting well-known characters from literature,'' <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the first lady, said Wednesday. The tree's theme is family literacy, <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said, adding that it will be decorated by Monday. With first lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> looking on, the tree was hauled from the White House gate to the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Portico </LOCATION> in a wreath-adorned carriage pulled by Clydesdales. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stroked the tree admiringly, but the horses made <PERSON> Millie </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> family dog, nervous. `` Stay right where you are,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a commanding tone to the horses as <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> cowered nearby. Finally, the first lady scooped up <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> in her arms as photographers frantically maneuvered to get the shot. `` It's just because she's never seen a horse before,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Millie can not steal this show, please.'' Growers <PERSON> Duane </PERSON>, <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spartansburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, won a contest sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christmas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the right to have one of their trees displayed at the nation's most prominent residence A White House delegation traveled to the family's 140-acre farm, selecting a 21-foot tree sturdy enough to support 100 dolls. The tree will be cut down to 18 feet. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkey </PERSON> brought his two children, <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>, 4, and <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON>, 6, to Wednesday's ceremony, and they were invited to sit in the carriage as it rolled past reporters and guests. The growers wondered how the tree would fit through the White House door. `` Miracles happen every year here. Do n't worry, it'll get in,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The White House tree is different from the National Christmas Tree, a 35-foot blue spruce, also from <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, transplanted here in 1977 to be the centerpiece of an annual holiday pageant. That tree, which sits on the grassy Ellipse south of the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, will be lighted at a Dec. 14 ceremony.

 A male prostitute who testified before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee on his relationship with Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> remains under subpoena and may be called back for additional testimony, the panel's chairman says. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON>, who claims to have run a male prostitution ring out of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> apartment, testified for four hours Wednesday at a closed meeting of the ethics committee. In past comments, <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> had suggested that he had information embarrassing to other members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> besides <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass. But after the hearing, the ethics panel's chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., said <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON>'s testimony did not expand the scope of the investigation <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> may be called back for additional testimony, but that the investigation `` is n't any broader'' as a result of the information he provided Wednesday. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> has said he had a brief sexual relationship with <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> after meeting him and paying him $ 80 for sex in 1985. He said he later hired <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> with personal funds to serve as a housekeeper and driver from July 1985 through August 1987. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> has acknowledged that he intervened with <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> probation authorities on <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON>'s behalf. But he denies other allegations by <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON>, including that he knew <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> was running a prostitution ring from his apartment, and that <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> evidently took advantage of him. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> had acknowledged his homosexuality before <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON>'s allegations were made Leaving the session, <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> said he was not out to destroy <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s reputation and career. `` I think he's a very fine person.

Neither <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> nor his attorney, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON>, attended Wednesday's session. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said the committee will continue its investigation through the current congressional recess, which is scheduled to end Jan. 23.

 <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, ending a prolonged silence, says 2,016 military and other <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> personnel have died in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> since President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> began his commitment there 14 years ago. <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pino </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Cuban diplomatic mission here, gave that figure Wednesday in announcing that the remains of all Cubans who died carrying out international missions in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and elsewhere have been returned to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in recent days. The Cuban casualty toll had never before been discussed officially. The dead were being honored at a ceremony today outside <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> at which <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> was due to participate along with Angolan President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> and Ethiopian Vice President <PERSON> Fisseha </PERSON> <PERSON> Desta </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pino </PERSON> said 2,289 Cubans, including troops and civilian technical advisers, have died abroad over the years. More than 400,000 have participated in such missions, mostly in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pino </PERSON> said 160 Cubans died in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, where thousands of Cuban troops were sent in 1977, two years after <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s involvement in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> began. The number of Cuban dead in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> has been the subject of considerable speculation over the years, but <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has always regarded the figure as a state secret. Three years ago, Angolan anti-communist rebel leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, whose forces have been fighting the Cuban-backed government for years, put the Cuban death toll at more than 6,000. Of the 2,289 casualties, <PERSON> Pino </PERSON> said 863 were killed in combat, 595 died of illness and 829 were accident fatalities. The remains of 36 Cubans could not be recovered; several others disappeared. The remains were returned to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> between Nov. 27 and Dec. 4 and have been sent to their hometowns. Over the years, some families have complained that the remains of relatives who died while serving the revolution abroad had not been brought back to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> for burial. At its peak, <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> involvement in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> reached 50,000 personnel but <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> agreed last December to withdraw all its forces by early 1991 as part of an accord brokered by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s troop commitment to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> declined over the years, ending several months ago. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> also has been involved in internationalist missions of either a civilian or military nature in a number of other countries, including <LOCATION> Equatorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, and in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> as well.

 <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> has watched with anguish for nearly seven years as his daughter lies unconscious in a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> hospital and he says listening to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> consider her fate was yet another sad event. It `` certainly was a very painful thing to sit through,'' <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> said after the the justices heard arguments on whether his daughter's feeding tube should be removed. `` I would like to be able to express my feelings to them why we are very comfortable with our decision, why we feel that we are doing what <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> would want us to do,'' he said. <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON>, a 55-year-old sheet metal worker from southwestern <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, and his wife, want the nation's highest court to grant their request for removal of a feeding tube sustaining their brain-damaged daughter, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>. On Wednesday, justices for the first time took up the `` right-to-die'' issue as they heard oral arguments by attorneys in the case of the 32-year-old woman, who has been in what doctors call a persistent vegetative state since a 1983 automobile accident. The <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has ruled that doctors can not remove the tube that supplies food and water keeping Ms. <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> alive. The family's attorney, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Colby </PERSON>, told the justices that if Ms. <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> were `` lucid for a moment and could come before this court,'' she would `` choose liberty'' and ask for removal of the feeding tube. But she will never recover to do that, he said. Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Presson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> maintained that Ms. <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON>'s parents have no right to permit their daughter's death, especially without `` clear and convincing evidence'' she would choose to die Letting her die `` goes against the state's interest in preventing suicide,'' he said. Solicitor General <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's top courtroom lawyer, supported the state's position. A ruling by the court is expected by July. The justices recently have been reluctant to expand individual rights, but they gave no clear sign on the outcome of the case as they questioned the lawyers during arguments. <PERSON> Colby </PERSON> said after the case that he did n't expect the court to issue a broad ruling on the the right-to-die question. An estimated 10,000 people in this country are being kept alive in a manner similar to that used for Ms. <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON>. Legal and medical officials say the court's ruling could set a precedent in determining the limits of life-sustaining care. Doctors say Ms. <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> could live for 30 years or more in her current condition unless the feeding tube is removed. Her body is rigid, her hands and feet constricted and bent into claw shapes. She can breathe on her own and at times her eyes are open and move randomly. <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>, an older daughter and two grandchildren watched the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> proceedings. Afterward, he expressed concerns about the possible effects on other families if the high court denies his daughter a right to die. He contended it would force people to consider initially not ordering life-sustaining treatment for fear that it could not later be stopped. `` This puts families in a terrible situation of being faced with making a decision about life support when there is still hope, when it still might do some good,'' he said. Asked how he thought the oral arguments played out to the justices, <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> replied, `` I have no idea. I'm not an attorney. I'm just a spectator.''

 Lawyers for a man convicted of operating a drug ring that took in $ 2 million a week in the nation's capital say they will appeal the verdict, while <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> says the convicted dealer will now face other charges. <PERSON> Rayful </PERSON> <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, 24, was convicted Wednesday of operating a cocaine distribution network that prosecutors said was responsible for up to 30 percent of the cocaine sold in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. A 12-member <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury found <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> guilty of all seven charges against him after more than four days of deliberations, capping a 12-week trial held amid extremely tight security. The verdict means <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> faces a mandatory life prison sentence. Ten other defendants were convicted of assisting him. `` Everyone on the defense team is upset by the verdict,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON>'s attorneys. `` We had the cards stacked against us from the beginning ... and we are going to appeal.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> has not yet set a sentencing date for <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> or his associates. <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> faces additional charges, including three counts of first-degree murder and conspiracy. <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said he plans to try <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> on those charges, despite the mandatory life sentence in the drug distribution case. `` Our immediate plan is to proceed,'' <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said. `` The primary goal ... is to bring this organization to a halt.'' Prosecutors had described <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON>'s drug network as a blend of family members and close friends who conducted their operations with a sophisticated _ and deadly _ entrepreneurial flare. The charges against <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> included conspiracy to violate drug laws, employing minors to possess and distribute cocaine, traveling across state lines to sell drugs and using a telephone to set up illegal drug deals. Convictions on those counts satisfy a definition of a continuing criminal enterprise, a crime that carries a mandatory life sentence. <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON>'s 10 co-defendants, including an aunt, a sister, a brother and several close friends, were found guilty of conspiracy to deal drugs. That crime carries a penalty of 10 years to life in prison. At its peak last summer, the prosecutors charged, the Edmond network was pumping up to 440 pounds of cocaine per week into the streets of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` The message should be clear _ if you deal death and destruction, you will pay with your life,'' <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said. After noting that <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> had been perceived by some friends and neighbors as a hero for his ability to make money, the prosecutor said <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> should be seen instead as a `` purveyor of human destruction.'' The trial featured extremely strict security measures. At the outset, <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> ruled that jurors' names be kept secret even from himself and lawyers to protect the jury from reprisals. The home of one witness' mother was firebombed during the trial and an informant was shot after his name was accidentally divulged by the prosecution. Defense lawyer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> suggested that the unusual security provisions _ including a 1 -LCB- - inch bullet-proof shield around the courtroom _ made it impossible for the defendants to receive a fair trial `` No matter what happened in that courtroom, it was going to make it very difficult to give Mr. <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> the benefit of the doubt,'' he said.

<HEAD>Poll: More Americans See Communism on the Wane</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Half of all Americans believe communism is dying, twice the number who thought so nine months ago, a <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll has found. The survey found views of communism shifting radically as reform sweeps <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, with far fewer Americans now seeing the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> allies as a threat. But more Americans feel threatened by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, where authorities in June suppressed pro-democracy demonstrators. And the poll found no change in the relatively high level of concern about communism in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The survey tracked opinion by repeating questions that first were asked in a Media General-Associated Press poll in March, a few months before the <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> movement </ORGANIZATION> gained full force in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The change in opinion was striking. Then, for example, only 19 percent said communism was on the decline around the world. In the new poll, 54 percent said communism was declining worldwide _ a nearly threefold increase. Similarly, 52 percent regarded communism in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as less of a threat to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security now than in the past; in March, just 28 percent held that view. And 51 percent in the new poll saw Soviet communism as less of a threat to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, up from 38 percent nine months ago. In one of their broadest measures, the surveys asked respondents: `` In your view, is communism dying, or not?'' In March, 25 percent said yes. In the new poll, 52 percent said yes. The new survey was conducted Nov. 17-25, as many of the changes reshaping <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> were still evolving. The changes, some of which culminated after the poll was done, include establishment of a partially non-communist government in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the fall of Communist leaderships in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Optimism was the greatest for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where on Nov. 9 the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> was opened after 28 years of division from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. Sixty percent in the survey expected that within their lifetimes East Germans will enjoy the same freedoms Americans have now. By contrast, only 26 percent expected American-style freedoms to come within their lifetimes to residents of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, where reforms are progressing more slowly and the Communist party retains supremacy. And only 14 percent expected such freedoms in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, where soldiers staged a bloody crackdown on dissidents near <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> on June 3-4. Indeed, during the past nine months more Americans have come to see <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as an increasing threat to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, while those seeing <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as less of a threat fell from 34 percent in March to 20 percent now. While fewer Americans now believe <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is moving away from communist political and economic systems, the opposite was true for <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Seventy-five percent believed some of the Eastern European countries are moving away from communist economies, up from 47 percent in March. And 70 percent believed some of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> was dropping the communist system, more than double the number in March. The movement of opinion about the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, like the change there, was less abrupt. Sixty-seven percent believed the Soviets are leaving their communist economic system, up from 58 percent; and 48 percent believed the Soviets are changing their political structure, up from 31 percent. As in the earlier poll, concern was greatest about communism in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>: Forty-six percent called it an increasing threat to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, virtually unchanged from March. Men and more highly educated respondents in the new poll were likeliest to believe that communism is declining or even dying, and that the threat to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> posed by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is decreasing. The survey, conducted by telephone, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a communications company based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal, and operates TV stations <ORGANIZATION> WXFL </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, WCBD in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> WJKS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises, Stocks Hit Another New High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar rose against the Japanese yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Thursday, while the key index on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> set another new high. The dollar closed at 144.13 yen, up 0.38 yen from Wednesday's close of 143.75 yen After opening at 143.95 yen, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency ranged between 143.94 and 144.33 yen. On the stock market, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, which rose 160.12 points for a record closing of 37,654.29 Wednesday, added another 203.82 points, or 0.54 percent, to close at 37,858.11, another new high. Currency dealers said the dollar's bullish opening in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> was largely due to the currency's gains on overseas markets overnight. The dollar-buying was triggered by warnings issued by the East German military that it would not tolerate attempts by citizens to seize munitions from security installations, according to dealers. A fleeting fear that the military might take action to block the country's reform movement led some to sell the West German currency for dollars, they said. The dollar's decline against the mark in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was accelerated overnight by comments from <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Undersecretary of the Treasury <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON>, who said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was `` not alarmed'' about the dollar's recent steep 10 percent decline against the mark. He also noted the dollar has only slipped 2 percent against the yen.

 A father whose entire family was among the 27 people killed in a fiery bus crash cast a stern gaze from the witness stand at the man accused in the nation's deadliest alcohol-related traffic accident. `` I just wanted to see if the man sitting over there being tried for the murder of my three girls would have enough compassion to look my way as I looked his way,'' Army 1st Sgt. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said after testifying Wednesday in <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s murder and drunken-driving trial. `` And I did n't see it.'' From the witness stand in <ORGANIZATION> Carroll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> glared at <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> as he told of losing his wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Joy </PERSON>, 34, and daughters <PERSON> Kristen </PERSON>, 14 and <PERSON> Robin </PERSON>, 10. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was the last in a series of parents and spouses who testified about the 24 youths and three adults who died in the May 14, 1988, crash. Authorities said the crash occurred when <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> drove his pickup truck in the wrong lanes of Interstate 71 south of this <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> town and plowed into the bus owned by the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Radcliff </LOCATION>. In July, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> married the widow of another crash victim, <PERSON> Dotty </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearman </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who also testified about her loss. Her husband, bus driver <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearman </PERSON>, and a niece were killed. Her daughter, <PERSON> Christy </PERSON>, survived with severe burns. `` <PERSON> Christy </PERSON> returned and was severely injured,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> was brought back in a cold, black body bag.'' In other testimony, two witnesses said <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> was drunk the night of the crash. <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantrell </PERSON>, a laboratory supervisor from <ORGANIZATION> Humana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital-University </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, testified a blood sample drawn from <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> after the crash showed a blood alcohol level of 0.24. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Comstock </PERSON>, a state police chemist, said he tested the same blood sample drawn four days after the crash. His tests showed blood alcohol levels of 0.18 and 0.20. In <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, a person is considered intoxicated if their blood alcohol level is at least 0.10. Defense attorney <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldani </PERSON> attacked the discrepancy among the three tests. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, 36, is charged with 27 counts of murder, 42 counts of wanton endangerment, 12 counts of assault and a count of drunken driving. Testimony of the parents and spouses was brief because a <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision limits questioning of homicide victims' family members to basic biographical information about the deceased, said Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Richwalsky </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said even a short time on the stand was painful. `` When the lawyer says, ` When was the last time you saw your family?' ... for a second or two, I honestly saw <PERSON> Kristen </PERSON> walk down the hall to the bedroom, and I remember putting my arms around her and I remember kissing her goodbye and telling her I loved her,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> told reporters later. He spoke at length and in heart-breaking detail about his experiences during the trial. `` This is the second Christmas I'm going without my two daughters,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` And I miss them every day.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> viewed <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s three emotional outbursts in court last month as an expression of guilt but not sorrow. `` But for his three times, I have broken down three thousand times,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Navy Defends Billion Dollar Destroyer</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is defending its new $ 1.2 billion destroyer in the wake of fresh charges that the ship could be detected by Soviet airborne radar despite <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> attempts to make it radar-evading. `` With the <PERSON> Arleigh </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> class, this is the best warship the world has seen,'' <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said in response to allegations from one lawmaker that the destroyer program is fraught with technical and financial problems. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., who last September called the $ 33 billion destroyer program a `` procurement nightmare'' of cost overruns and schedule delays, contended Wednesday that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> was forced to bail out the destroyer's manufacturer _ <ORGANIZATION> Bath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> In a letter to Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> said Bath Iron Works faced serious financial problems and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spent between $ 75 million to $ 90 million to save the company The <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Democrat also said the money came from unspecified <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> accounts and questioned whether `` slush funds'' were common at the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` Clearly, I think the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and the contractors are attempting to hoodwink both of us,'' <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> said in a three-page letter to <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on seapower and strategic and critical materials. The letter, dated Dec. 4, was obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>, president and chief operating officer of Bath Iron Works, called the bailout suggestion `` laughable.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and the company did agree on contract adjustments, but they totaled $ 35 million. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> denied that a bailout took place and stressed that the ships, hailed as the most advanced combat ships ever, will be built within budget. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, in a two-paragraph statement released late Wednesday, said he received <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>'s letter, which `` makes many assertions and raises many questions of fact.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> tells me today that some of this information is incorrect, and that some of the letter's conclusions are unjustified,'' said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who cautioned against jumping to conclusions but promised a subcommittee inquiry into the destroyer program when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> returns in January. The DDG-51 destroyer, named after <PERSON> Arleigh </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, World War II naval hero and former chief of naval operations, is designed with a more expensive all-steel superstructure instead of one that was part aluminum and more prone to splintering and fire damage. The first destroyer, which is scheduled to be delivered to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in February 1991, will be equipped with sophisticated Aegis computers and Tomahawk cruise missiles. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has tried to reduce the destroyer's radar cross-section, which is the enemy's ability to discern the type of ship showing up on radar, and give it some of the characteristics of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s B-2 stealth bomber. The steps taken by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to reduce the radar cross-section of the new destroyer include `` more rounded edges and less 90-degree angles. ... A reduction in cross-section means an enemy has to get in closer,'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. The same approach was taken with the B-2. <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> contends that incorporating stealth characteristics on an 8,315-ton all-steel ship became an overwhelming design and engineering problem for Bath Iron Works that led to the contract increases. <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> also said that `` according to experts, an airborne radar at an altitude of 50,000 feet would detect it easily at over 300 miles.'' Complicating the situation is the number of Soviet anti-radiation missiles that can be air-launched, ship-launched or submarine-launched, said <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, who cited a secret report by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> titled, `` Special Assessment on the Anti-Radiation Missile Threat.'' <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> questioned the appropriateness of <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>'s references to a classified issue such as naval radar capability `` The whole business of radar signature still has same classifications. Congressman <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> can choose to violate his security clearance. I do n't choose to violate mine,'' <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> said. `` Suffice it to say we think he's wrong,'' the executive added.

 A man with a long history of juvenile offenses was executed by injection early Thursday for the robbery-murder of a woman whose pleas for mercy were recorded by a police dispatcher. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLuna </PERSON>, 27, was pronounced dead at 12:24 a.m. He was condemned to death for the 1983 robbery-slaying of <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, 24, a service station clerk in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>. `` I want to say I hold no grudges,'' <PERSON> DeLuna </PERSON> said in a brief final statement. `` I hate nobody. I want my family to know I love them. I want to tell everyone on death row to keep the faith up _ to keep going. Everything will be all right.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected by a 7-2 vote a request to halt the execution until a new appeal could be filed on his behalf. The 5th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> refused to block it Tuesday. <PERSON> DeLuna </PERSON> was the fourth person executed this year in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, bringing to 33 the number of executions in the state since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> allowed capital punishment to resume in 1976. The total is the highest of any state. Nationwide, 120 people have been put to death. Ms. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, alerted by customers that a man with a knife was outside the station, was on the phone with police when <PERSON> DeLuna </PERSON> came in for a pack of cigarettes Feb. 4, 1983. `` On the tape, she's talking to the cops. ... And then you heard that scream,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiwetz </PERSON>, the assistant district attorney who prosecuted <PERSON> DeLuna </PERSON>. `` He was just real belligerent. This was totally uncalled for. There was just no reason to kill this girl. He did n't know her. `` The last thing she was saying was, ` I'll give the money.' But he just wanted to stick her with the knife. It's really a bad deal.'' <PERSON> DeLuna </PERSON>, on parole for about six weeks after serving part of a three-year sentence for attempted rape and car theft, was arrested after he was found hiding under a truck near the slaying. Witnesses identified him at trial. He had insisted another person committed the crime but has refused to elaborate. `` I'm not going to talk about it,'' he said. `` I took the stand. The jury did n't believe me.'' The high school dropout blamed his problems on alcohol and drug abuse, plus getting mixed up with `` the wrong crowd.'' <PERSON> Schiwetz </PERSON> said <PERSON> DeLuna </PERSON>'s juvenile record included numerous thefts. `` This guy stole every car in Corpus Christi before he was 18.'' <PERSON> DeLuna </PERSON> said in his last interview a week ago that he was afraid of dying. `` I do n't think anybody can prepare yourself for dying,'' he said. `` I ca n't imagine myself lying down on that gurney. I try to but I ca n't.''

<HEAD>Newly Empowered Citizen Investigators Turn Tables on Secret Police</HEAD>
<BYLINE>With PM-East Germany, Bjt ^By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A nervous <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Jurich </PERSON> gestured toward the rain-soaked grounds of the secret police institute he directs, a place where workers crack codes and build eavesdropping devices. `` As you can see there are no helicopters or tanks here now,'' he offered. In an odd switch that only could have come during these heady days of the East German uprising, it was the secret police who were getting the third degree. <PERSON> Jurich </PERSON>'s interrogators were reform activists from a new citizens committee that has taken it upon itself to probe official corruption. Three activists from the organization, which is quartered above a religious bookstore on Sophienstrasse, jumped into a mud-encrusted <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Golf </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday after getting a call from colleagues with a hot tip. `` All we know is that witnesses in the area have reported that helicopters and tanks were moving around yesterday and trucks were seen hauling away material,'' <PERSON> Gabriela </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleiner </PERSON> of the New Forum pro-democracy group explained as the car careened through <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s muddy central streets. `` This could be dangerous. That's why we are taking along the press, as protection.'' A carload of journalists from the Communist-run <PERSON> Berliner </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeitung </PERSON> followed behind the speeding graftbusters. The `` Independent Investigative Committee'' was formed by reform movement activists on Sunday after word spread that ousted Communist leaders accused of corruption were having incriminating evidence removed from their offices. Angry citizens began standing watch around official buildings on Monday and Tuesday until police could set up a security cordon to prevent losses. Communist Premier <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> has ordered police units to cooperate with the citizens' committee, but officials are still considering whether it should have access to information collected by a government panel probing corruption. East German television on Tuesday disclosed the group's existence and gave out its address and telephone number for those with information to relay At least 200 calls were fielded overnight and early Wednesday at the committee office. `` This is our second special action,'' explained <PERSON> Matthias </PERSON> <PERSON> Etzold </PERSON>, driver of the Golf. `` But last time, on Monday, we arrived too late and everything was gone.'' Asked what they planned to do should they encounter the reported tanks or helicopters, Ms. <PERSON> Kleiner </PERSON> said they would call the police. After 30 minutes of negotiating rutted roads, the car screeched to a halt in front of a gated and guarded compound on <LOCATION> Kopenickstrasse </LOCATION>. `` We're from the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and we want to talk to responsible officials,'' Etzold shouted through the narrow opening of a clouded plexiglass window at an entrance security booth. The whole entourage was invited in to meet with federal minister for science and research, <PERSON> Peter-Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Budig </PERSON>, who had n't noticed tanks or air actions in recent days. `` But this is all necessary. I'm all for it,'' the smiling official offered eagerly, commenting on the ambush visit. `` It's necessary to clear the air and have a fresh start. Maybe it was the compound next door, where the federal <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> operates a research institute, he offered. `` Yes, we were told you were coming,'' confessed the gate guard at the secret police's <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our director will be here to talk with you in a moment.'' <PERSON> Jurich </PERSON>, a portly, crew-cut bureaucrat sweating profusely despite the damp December cold, had likely already been having a bad day, since the entire leadership of the secret police resigned Tuesday night under pressure. Reform groups had assailed the ministry's leadership for allowing agents to do what they had done with impunity for years _ harass and beat protesters. Told of reports alleging removal of evidence from the premises, <PERSON> Jurich </PERSON> laughed nervously and pointed out that there was no military hardware in evidence. `` Mind if we have a look around?'' Etzold queried. First the answer was no, as the compound was a sensitive `` point of manufacture of electronic warfare materials, which you can use your imagination to calculate the use of,'' <PERSON> Jurich </PERSON> said. Then he offered a short tour of the metal-littered grounds in consolation. `` We have nothing to hide,'' the director contended. The group was able to see nothing more complicated than rusting pipes and palettes of what looked like mailboxes piled outside factory doors. No, the investigators could not talk to workers. This was, after all, a matter of state security. `` We've wasted our time,'' bemoaned Ms. <PERSON> Kleiner </PERSON>. `` The problem is that we are so naive. This is a Mafia we are dealing with.''

<HEAD>Navy: Soviets Launch Aircraft From New Carrier</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> can now launch ground-attack jets from its first full-scale aircraft carrier, a naval aviation advance that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> says holds the potential for offensive use. The development came only days before <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> pressed President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on naval arms control issues at the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> summit. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> confirmed on Wednesday that the 65,000-ton <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> aircraft carrier had launched and recovered three fighter jets during trials in the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> _ the MiG-29 Fulcrum, a SU-27 Flanker and the SU-25 Frogfoot ground attack aircraft. The <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>'s capabilities are a marked advance over the much smaller Kiev-class carrier, which is capable of transporting only helicopters and jump-jets. While the <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>'s sea trials are not unexpected, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials pointed to the type of aircraft used on the carrier as interesting _ as well as the timing of the event. `` They are way ahead of schedule,'' said one <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officer, who spoke on condition he not be identified by name. Use of an aircraft carrier vastly improves Soviet tactical aviation capabilities, allowing fighter jets to be launched far beyond the range of Soviet borders. The <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> is the first of its class, while two others are under construction. The ship uses a `` ski jump'' bow to launch aircraft and not the high-powered catapults that hurl jets from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers. But the Soviets do use the arresting wires that stop planes as they land on the deck, just as the American carriers do. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, in a statement pointing to the ship's offensive capabilities, said: `` The Soviets have insisted that the <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> ... -LRB- is -RRB- intended for defensive purposes only. ... Nonetheless, the demonstrated capability of the <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> to accommodate a variant of one of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s principal ground-attack aircraft, the Frogfoot, shows a potential for offensive operations.'' While <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said the trials took place in mid-November, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> confirmed them several days after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> sought to ban short-range nuclear weapons aboard the superpowers' ships, according to <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> illustrated his concern over the wide-ranging <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, giving <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a map of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval bases, deployments and maneuvers around the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In rejecting <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s argument, said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> maintained that `` the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is a land-based power. But the navy is crucial to us in terms of maintaining all of our commitments around the world, maintaining open sea lanes and commercial lanes around the world.'' Another defense official said the definition of the Soviet warship as an aircraft carrier is of some importance to the region. `` The Soviets continue to tell <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> that this is not an aircraft carrier,'' he said, adding that the Soviets contend it is a `` heavy aircraft-carrying cruiser.'' Under the 1936 <LOCATION> Montreux </LOCATION> Convention, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> could bar the movement of such a warship through the Dardanelles, which is the passage between the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, the official said. The convention put the control of the water passage in Turkish hands, and it allows the nation to close the straits to warships of other nations in time of war. The Soviets have stated that the <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> will join the <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> and operate out of the <LOCATION> Kola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Baker Clears First Hurdle to Mideast Peace Talks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> still faces tough problems in getting <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace talks started, even with the conditional acceptance by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> of a first round of negotiations. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> will be able to convene talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> early next year with the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. However, going beyond that stage will take slick maneuvering by <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> as well as concessions from all sides. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, speaking through <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, agreed Wednesday to the session. The Israeli Cabinet agreed last month. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials made it clear that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> still have reservations about what happens next, and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> will have to find a way to ease their concerns to keep going. Basically, <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s group is clinging to its claim to represent Palestinians everywhere. It wants to play a role in selecting the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation that would meet with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> as the next step in a drawn-out peace process. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, on the other hand, wants to exclude the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> even from a behind-the-scenes role. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s five-point program guarantees that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will go to <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> only `` after a satisfactory list of Palestinians has been worked out.'' But another provision of the <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> plan specifies that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> can not substitute itself for the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and that it `` will consult with Palestinians on all aspects of the dialogue.'' That could mean the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> will be able to play an influential role even if it's not at the table. Despite the problems, though, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> achieved a breakthrough of sorts after three months of dickering with Foreign Ministers <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Meguid </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. They will continue the bargaining at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> meeting, which <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said would be held in January, at the earliest. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goal is to carry out a proposal by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> for elections among the 1.4 million Palestinians who live on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. The elected Palestinians would negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> an arrangement for limited self-rule. After the five-year experiment, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and Palestinians would hold talks on an overall settlement. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has repeatedly denounced the Israeli scenario as a scheme to undercut Palestinian aspirations for statehood. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> telephoned <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> with the news of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s conditional acceptance. <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> told him the Israeli government would study the response, said <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaron </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the Israeli Embassy. A senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, declining to be identified, said that now that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has qualified acceptance from the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` he can get down to work on dealing with their views.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> three months ago began an arduous diplomatic effort to bridge the gap between the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. His plan includes the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> meeting with <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Meguid </PERSON>. Another provision of his five-point program, released by Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>, is that `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> understands that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will attend the dialogue only after a satisfactory list of Palestinians has been worked out.'' A third provision guarantees that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> will consult with Palestinians `` on all aspects of the dialogue.'' A fourth assures the Palestinians that those who meet with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` would be free to raise issues that relate to their opinions on how to make elections and the negotiating process succeed.'' This could be a vehicle for Palestinians to assert statehood aspirations and also to register demands extending beyond the limited self-rule <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> envisions for five years on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. For the past two years, <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> in the territories have clashed with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities. At least 626 have died in the process, while 155 other Palestinians were killed by Arabs on suspicion of cooperating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Also, 43 Israeli soldiers and civilians died in the rebellion.

 A man who blamed his life of crime on drugs and alcohol was put to death by injection early today for the murder of a woman whose final cries of terror were recorded by a police dispatcher. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLuna </PERSON> became the 33rd murderer executed in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> since the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s 1976 decision to allow resumption of capital punishment. The total is the highest of any state. Nationwide, 120 people have been put to death. The high court cleared the way for the execution late Wednesday by rejecting a request for a delay. <PERSON> DeLuna </PERSON>, 27, was pronounced dead at 12:24 a.m., 10 minutes after corrections officials began injecting the lethal drugs into his arm. `` I want to say I hold no grudges, I hate nobody,'' he said while strapped to a gurney in the death chamber. `` I want my family to know I love them. I want to tell everyone on death row to keep the faith up, to keep going. Everything will be all right.'' He took three deep breaths and stopped moving. <PERSON> DeLuna </PERSON> was executed for the Feb. 4, 1983, robbery-slaying of <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, a 24-year-old service station clerk in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> had called police for help after customers told her they had seen a man with a knife outside the convenience store-gas station where she worked. <PERSON> DeLuna </PERSON> came in for a pack of cigarettes, authorities said. `` On the tape, she's talking to the cops. ... And then you heard that scream,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiwetz </PERSON>, who prosecuted <PERSON> DeLuna </PERSON>. `` The last thing she was saying was, ` I'll give the money.' But he just wanted to stick her with the knife. It's really a bad deal.'' <PERSON> DeLuna </PERSON>, on parole for about six weeks after serving part of a three-year sentence for attempted rape and car theft, was arrested after he was found hiding under a truck near the slaying. Witnesses identified him at trial. He had insisted another person committed the crime but refused to elaborate. `` I'm not going to talk about it,'' he said. `` I took the stand. The jury did n't believe me.'' The high school dropout blamed his problems on alcohol and drug abuse, plus getting mixed up with `` the wrong crowd.'' <PERSON> Schiwetz </PERSON> said <PERSON> DeLuna </PERSON>'s juvenile record included numerous thefts. `` This guy stole every car in Corpus Christi before he was 18.'' <PERSON> DeLuna </PERSON> had come with 12 hours of execution in 1986 before a federal judge halted the execution. In an interview last week, he said he was afraid of being executed. `` I do n't think anybody can prepare yourself for dying,'' he said. `` I ca n't imagine myself lying down on that gurney. I try to but I ca n't.'' When told about the execution, Ms. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>' mother, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON>, said, `` I'm glad this is over with.''

<HEAD>Quayle Says Foreigners Like Gorbachev Better Than Soviets Do</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> says the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not get too hung up on Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s charming manner, while pointing out that foreigners like him more than his own countrymen do. `` The personality can help bring about these reforms and we should encourage that,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said in a televised interview Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Larry King Live'' show. `` The president wants to encourage that and he wants to offer help to Chairman <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to have these reforms,'' the vice president said. `` But instead of getting caught up in the magnetic personality of Chairman <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, we've got to look beyond that and see if there are true lasting reforms taking place.'' Following President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s meetings at <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> last week, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> expressed skepticism about Soviet foreign policy, saying in a published interview Monday that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> still wants to `` create instability'' in other nations. While that view seemed to contrast with the friendly nature of the talks between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, White House officials moved quickly to say there was no disagreement between the president and the vice president. Before the vice president's televised remarks Wednesday, Soviet spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s views on Soviet foreign policy `` sounded strange.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has consistently taken a tougher view of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> than other administration officials, and while he spoke well of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> during Wednesday's interview, he said relations should not be based on one man. `` We want him to succeed in perestroika, we want him to succeed in glasnost,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` But sometime, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will not, sometime down the road, will not be the leader of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` His popularity is probably greater outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> than in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. Recent polls in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> support <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s observations on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s popularity, the first time a high <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official has said such things. A survey for the West German magazine <ORGANIZATION> Der </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spiegel </ORGANIZATION> last summer found 82 percent of 2,000 voters polled were convinced that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform policies in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will succeed. A parallel survey of 1,000 <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> citizens conducted for the magazine by the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> found that 59 percent thought perestroika will succeed. In sheer popularity, <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> found that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> rated higher than West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll last month found that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> have roughly equal popularity in this country.

 A young rifleman invaded the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> engineering school on Wednesday and singled out females for his targets, killing 14 women and wounding 12 people before committing suicide, police said. <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> said the killer, clad in a hunting outfit, rushed into a packed classroom at one point during his murderouls rampage and yelled in French, `` You're all a bunch of feminists! A police officer who arrived on the scene found that his daughter was among the dead in what may be the worst mass shooting in Canadian history. Police did not identify the gunman, who was described as being in his 20s and used what looked like a .22 caliber rifle as he moved up the first three floors of the building, systematically singling out women and shooting them. The gunman's first name was <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> _ no other name was released at a late-night news conference by police _ and a three-page letter, expressing his hatred for feminists, was found in his possession. The handwritten letter blamed unspecified failures in the gunman's life on unidentified women and said he was going to kill some women in revenge, said <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Duscheneau </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> police senior investigator. The man began the rampage in a first-floor cafeteria, where he killed three women, <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> said. The gunman then went up to the second floor and walked into a packed classroom, ordering the men into one corner of the room and the women into another, police said. He told the men to leave. They did so, and police said the gunman screamed before opening fire on the women: `` You're all a bunch of feminists.'' Six slain women were later found in the classroom. On the same floor, he killed a woman in an administration office. Then he climbed to the third floor, where he shot four more women in the corridor. `` It was a human hunt and we were the quarry,'' said one witness. He continued up to the fourth and fifth floors, shooting and wounding both men and women. Then, police say, he returned to the third floor and turned the gun on himself. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> at one point told reporters police were looking for two accomplices but said later he was mistaken and the man acted alone. `` I saw the bodies of the people who were slain _ they were all women,'' said <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Courville </PERSON>, director of the engineering school, his voice shaking. One student said a bullet passed his leg and he brought his hands up in a pleading gesture. The gunman left him alone. `` He was clearly gunning for the women,'' the student said. `` All I know is that a crazy guy came in here and began shooting at anything that moved,'' said <PERSON> Dominique </PERSON> <PERSON> Berube </PERSON>, 22, one of scores of terrified students who ran from the building. `` It's our friends who have been killed.'' She said some people threw themselves on the floor while others stood paralyzed. The injured, several in critical condition, were taken to four hospitals. Frenzied parents rushed to the university and were told to gather at a central location. `` I saw death close up and I shook,'' said student <PERSON> Vanthona </PERSON> <PERSON> Ouy </PERSON>, 22. Witnesses told police the gunman entered the classroom at about 5:20 p.m. EST. Students said the man emerged from the classroom, fired three or four shots at a group of people and ran up a flight of stairs. Student <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Bordeleau </PERSON> said he had to drag people by the collar to keep them from going in the man's direction. He said he heard 20 to 30 shots and the man appeared to be aiming mainly at women. `` I heard the gunman say: ` I want the women,''' said <PERSON> Bordeleau </PERSON>. Several other witnesses confirmed that the gunman said that. Student <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavarie </PERSON> said the gunman `` told us to stop everything. And then when we looked at him we thought it was a joke, but he fired a shot in the air and separated us into two groups, the guys in one corner and the girls in -LRB- another -RRB- corner. `` When that was done he asked the guys to leave, he left the girls in there. We got outside in the hallway and for a couple of minutes he stayed in there and after when he got out he leveled his gun at a group of people who were there and he shot three or four shots. `` I saw some people fall.'' <PERSON> Lucien </PERSON> <PERSON> Justin </PERSON>, who was in the computer room, said the assailant first aimed at the wall there and then ran out. `` Somebody locked the door but he shot off the lock and then left a second time,'' he said. `` I was terribly afraid, I ran like hell.'' `` Who could have thought that something like this could happen in a peaceful student world,'' said <PERSON> Ba </PERSON> <PERSON> Madou </PERSON>, 35, an engineering student. `` People thought it was a joke,'' said <PERSON> Stephane </PERSON> <PERSON> Meunier </PERSON>, an engineering student. `` People were in a state of shock.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemm </PERSON>, assistant director of security, said staff were at a Christmas party in the cafeteria when victims began to arrive. He said the timing could not have been more fortunate. `` The party was scheduled from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. and there was no booze. We called all the doctors and nurses to the operating room.''

<HEAD>Owners of Missing Lobster Boat Accused of Negligence in Lawsuit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal lawsuit against the owners of a missing lobster boat alleges that the vessel was unseaworthy and its crew inadequately trained. The suit was brought in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION> by the parents, brother and sister of 22-year-old <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hare </PERSON>, one of the five men aboard the missing <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>. It seeks unspecified damages. <PERSON> Hare </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Pawcatuck </LOCATION>, also had been a crewman on the <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON>, another lobster boat owned by <ORGANIZATION> Garbo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Stonington </LOCATION>, when it sank in 1988 without loss of life. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> called off its search for the <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> on Friday after spending 11 days searching more than 100,000 square miles of ocean for the 72-foot lobster boat. The vessel was last heard from Nov. 21 and was believed to have gone down in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. The lawsuit, filed Monday, charged that the presumed death of <PERSON> Hare </PERSON> was a result of negligence by the vessel's owners and operators, <ORGANIZATION> BFD </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Garbo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Garbo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Garbo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Garbo </PERSON>. A woman who would only identify herself as the office manager at <ORGANIZATION> Garbo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday the <PERSON> Garbos </PERSON> would be unavailable to comment on the lawsuit. `` It's a very tragic situation. They are really not able to cope with any interviews at this point,'' she said. According to the lawsuit, the owners and operators of the <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> ordered the boat to sail either without getting available weather information, or after ignoring weather information. Extremely poor weather hampered the search and presumably caused the loss of the vessel. The lawsuit charges that the boat lacked adequate safety and navigational equipment; the crew lacked adequate training, and the vessel was not a safe place to work. Filing the suit were <PERSON> Hare </PERSON>'s parents, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Hare </PERSON>; brother, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hare </PERSON>, and sister, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lensis </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Former U.S. Negotiator Urges Deep Cuts In Strategic Missiles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should press for additional cuts in strategic nuclear weapons once it finishes negotiating a pact to reduce those weapons by as much as half, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms negotiator says. `` Certainly we can afford to be more ambitious in our arms control proposals,'' former arms negotiator <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Warnke </PERSON> said Wednesday in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a private research group. Under the START -LRB- Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty -RRB- agreement now being negotiated, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet long-range bombers, missiles and submarines would be cut by 30 percent to 50 percent. <PERSON> Warnke </PERSON> said that agreement could be completed and signed at the summit President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> plan to hold in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> next June, a meeting the two leaders agreed to at the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> Summit last week. `` There is no reason at all we ca n't go ahead with a START 2 treaty,'' <PERSON> Warnke </PERSON> said. Such a second treaty should aim at banning missiles with multiple warheads, <PERSON> Warnke </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Warnke </PERSON> argued that Soviet troop withdrawals from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the political changes sweeping the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries mean fewer nuclear weapons are needed to defend the West. He said the major obstacle in the strategic arms reduction talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> was the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> program to devise a space shield against ballistic missile attack. `` But that idea left town with Mr. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Warnke </PERSON> said of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> championed by the former president but viewed with skepticism by many in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and most arms control experts. A ban on missiles with multiple warheads would eliminate the threat of a nuclear first strike by either side, <PERSON> Warnke </PERSON> suggested. Such an attack would require so many single-warhead missiles the aggressor would be unable to defend against nuclear retaliation _ and therefore would not launch an attack, he argued. But <PERSON> Warnke </PERSON>, who was former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s chief negotiator, stressed the two sides should complete the current START treaty first before making deeper cuts in their strategic weapons. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has approved a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration plan to extend the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arsenal of land-based missiles armed with multiple warheads that could reach all targets within the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by putting some on rail cars that could move around in a crisis, making them harder for the Soviets to destroy. <PERSON> Warnke </PERSON> said that `` probably was a lousy idea'' and would escalate nuclear tensions.

<HEAD>`Bear Man of Pack Creek' Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, who became a symbol of peaceful coexistence between humans and brown bears, has died of cancer. He was 90. Price, known as the `` bear man of <LOCATION> Pack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>,'' died Tuesday at the home of his great-nephew, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lingle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>, where he had been living since October. He lived for 40 years along the shores of <LOCATION> Pack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Admiralty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, which attracts thousands of visitors to see the world's largest concentration of brown bears. But Price himself also was an attraction _ a small, white-haired man who casually strolled among the fearsome-looking bruins, which can weigh more than 1,000 pounds, with nothing more than a walking stick for protection. A native of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, Price arrived in southeast <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> in 1927 in a sailboat he had built in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. In 1928, he set up a mining and logging operation at <LOCATION> Windham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> not far from <LOCATION> Pack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>. He also worked as a mechanic, fisherman and fox farmer. In the 20 years that he regularly visited his great-uncle, <PERSON> Lingle </PERSON> said he always felt safe walking with Price because of the special relationship he had with the bears. `` He always said if you're friends with the bears, the bears will be friends with you,'' <PERSON> Lingle </PERSON> said. `` He had a mutual respect with the bears and the proof is that he lived there for 40 years with only one incident.'' That occurred on a narrow path between Price's woodshed and his house on a beach. Price and a brown bear surprised each other and a face off began with neither backing down. The big brownie finally swatted Price, breaking his collarbone. Despite living in close quarters with about 25 brown bears that roam the <LOCATION> Pack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> area, Price never carried a rifle. A quick bop on the nose with his walking stick was usually sufficient if a bear got testy. As word of Price's special relationship with the bears spread, films, television shows and magazines told his story. During the 1980s, the number of visitors to <LOCATION> Pack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> increased dramatically. `` He had a gentleness and a special way of communicating with the bears,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION> wildlife filmmaker and <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> of Game member. `` He did n't subscribe to the theory that they were marauding killers lurking behind every tree.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said Price would walk to within 6 feet of the animals and talk to them. `` This is the passing of a grand old man that represents a unique part of the heritage of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. `` His legacy is that people can coexist with wildlife peacefully if we try. He taught that by example.'' Survivors include Price's second wife, <PERSON> Esther </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and has Alzheimer's disease, <PERSON> Lingle </PERSON> said. His first wife died of cancer.

 The use of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fighter jets to support President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> during the attempted coup has triggered nationalist outrage and added a new element to talks on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases negotiations. While rebels made threatening statements toward the approximately 100,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> in response to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s decision, they took no action against Americans trapped in rebel-held hotels. Indeed, public indignation largely has focused on Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s reliance on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military help in crushing the coup, the most serious since she took office in February 1986 `` When push came to shove, this government ... yelled for the <ORGANIZATION> Yanks </ORGANIZATION>. I for one am ashamed,'' wrote respected political commentator <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Soliven </PERSON> in the Philippine Daily Star. `` When a government can not overcome a rebellion without ` outside' help, I hope that this does not make it a colony, a satrap, or a banana republic all over again,'' said <PERSON> Soliven </PERSON>, recalling the half-century when the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> was a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> colony. `` How the nation's so-called leaders could possibly justify ... our complete dependence and subservience to a former colonial master truly blows the mind,'' chimed in columnist <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabrera </PERSON> in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-4 Phantom jets flew air cover Friday for loyalist forces. The jets did not fire on the rebels but prevented them from continuing air strikes targeting the presidential palace and military camps. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> had requested military assistance in a telephone call to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during the first hours of the coup, when the survival of her government appeared in doubt. The air support has been widely viewed as the turning point. The jets took off from <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, about 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. It is one of six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> with leases expiring in 1991. The future of the strategic bases is one of the hotest political topics in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, and the debate has intensified with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention in the attempted coup. Base supporters have argued that the installations give the economy a needed shot in the arm and provide strategic protection from foreign aggression. Opponents have claimed the bases, although technically under Philippine control, are U.S.-run and therefore an affront on national sovereignty. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s use of Phantoms from <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, however, has added a new element to the debate _ the bases as ultimate guarantor of democracy in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. A resolution drafted Wednesday by the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Nacionalista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of Vice President <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laurel </LOCATION> says the bases `` are not designed to promote mutual security but to perpetrate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hegemony in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>.'' It calls for non-renewal of the bases treaties and abrogation of the bilateral mutual security treaty. But House Speaker <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitra </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance `` was just to show the enemy of the people that there is another force which will support President <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> at a time when our democracy is endangered. It is a nice feeling to have, when you need assistance it is there. What would have happened if it did not come?'' Although Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has not expressed a clear position on the bases, she has been willing to negotiate new leases, which would be subject to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval. Talks that were expected to begin this month may now be delayed until 1990 because of the coup attempt. A senior official at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition he not be further identified, said there was `` nothing magic'' about a December start to negotiations and said a timetable would depend on the Philippine side. He said he did not believe <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement would make the talks more difficult, claiming that a `` large number of people ... were very happy the support came when it -LRB- did -RRB-.'' There has been no sign of widespread anti-American sentiment in the wake of the coup attempt.

 <PERSON> Hanko </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewitz </PERSON> raced up on his bicycle for his four-hour watch at secret police headquarters. His mission: prevent <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> officials from destroying evidence in a widening weapons scandal. The excited young supporter of the opposition New Forum group had to wait until classes were out Wednesday before he pedaled through this <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> port to take up watch. <LOCATION> Across </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, there are similar strange scenes. Angry citizens have this week surrounded and, in some cases, stormed local headquarters of the once-dreaded secret police. `` We check all material coming in and going out of this building. We are here to make sure the police do n't burn the papers. We control this building,'' said <PERSON> Dewitz </PERSON>, a 24-year-old medical student. Supporters of New Forum, the largest opposition group in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, occupied the building Monday upon hearing reports that Communist officials were involved in illegal weapons export from a nearby factory. There were also reports of the burning of documents. The focus of anger is the <ORGANIZATION> IMES </ORGANIZATION> factory at <LOCATION> Kavelstorf </LOCATION>, a village on a rolling plain about 10 miles south of <LOCATION> Rostock </LOCATION>. New Forum says it discovered cases of weapons among piles of household goods that the plant normally produces. The plant is now occupied by police, and a representative of New Forum is present at all times. A hand-lettered sign on the fence says `` New Forum Kavelstorf,'' and an East German flag with a white dove stitched on calls for demilitarization. The group charges that the weapons were exported for hard currency. The head of the firm has been arrested and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Schalck-Golodkowski </PERSON>, the government official who oversaw the operation, has turned himself to authorities in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where he had fled. A secretary in the mayor's office of <LOCATION> Kavelstorf </LOCATION> had this comment on the affair: `` Disgusting!'' Said a local mechanic: `` Everybody from the top party boss to the little local party leader was corrupt.'' The case has been turned over to the state prosecutor's office, which has put five lawyers on it. The people are being represented by New Forum. The scandal is the talk of the town, and by afternoon the local <ORGANIZATION> OstZee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeitung </ORGANIZATION> newspaper is now sold out. Once a Communist party mouthpiece, the daily now prints full reports of opposition activities and even lists planned demonstrations. Throughout <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the opposition has set itself a tall order to make sure that 40 years of incriminating documents do not vanish. In addition to its 24-hour guard inside the secret police building, New Forum has taken over a garage that serviced cars belonging to the police. The activists are allowing no information to be radioed out, and they say they have halted the burning of documents likely to incriminate secret police.

<HEAD>Witness: Defense Contractor Employees Swapped Classified Documents</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The swapping of classified <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget documents by employees of nine major defense contractors was `` endemic,'' according to a witness at the federal trial of a former <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> employee. The informal network of document trading existed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, government witnesses said Wednesday. It was the third day of the trial of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> worker accused of illegally obtaining secret <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> documents. <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> has pleaded innocent to 39 counts, including conspiracy, illegal conveyance of classified documents and mail fraud. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> earlier pleaded guilty to receiving classified documents and will pay a $ 5.2 million fine. Among the companies implicated in the document trading network besides <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> were <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bendix </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, RCA, <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Raytheon </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON>. `` I would describe it as endemic,'' <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Coutre </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Bendix </LOCATION> employee from 1972 to 1984, said of the document swaps. Ms. <PERSON> Coutre </PERSON> said everyone seemed to have the so-called `` planning, programming and budget system'' documents and she exchanged documents with <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> and employees of other defense companies. The documents were never entered in <PERSON> Bendix </PERSON>'s classified document log, Ms. <PERSON> Coutre </PERSON> said, adding that she kept the documents in a file cabinet or a safe and when they became outdated she would shred them or burn them in her fireplace. Ms. <PERSON> Coutre </PERSON> said she never asked <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> or others where they got the documents. `` It was an unspoken agreement that no one asked that question,'' she said. `` We did n't want to get people in trouble.'' Ms. <PERSON> Coutre </PERSON>, who was granted immunity from prosecution by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys, said the documents gave defense contractors some indication of how serious the Pentagon was about pursuing various projects. `` They were used primarily to support business decisions,'' she said. `` We had to look at the opportunities from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and make decisions on whether to invest money. We wanted to make sure the government was serious about the opportunities before we went forward.'' <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, an RCA employee from 1979 to 1984, said he also swapped documents, but the top source of supply was <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>'s supply of documents `` seemed to be continuous and quick'' and on at least two occasions <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> handed him documents from the trunk of his car parked in the garage at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Rosslyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, office. `` It was my sense that every major contractor had them,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who was also granted immunity from prosecution, said he `` never asked anyone what their source was. It was just not done. It was not the gentlemanly way to do things.'' But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he had the `` distinct impression'' that <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> got the documents from the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and he thought <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> was encouraging others in the network to develop <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> sources. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, who worked both for <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, said that he too swapped documents with <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> and others. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, who was called as a defense witness, said he did n't feel that exchanging the classified documents was illegal and that defense contractors had a legitimate right to know what was in the documents <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> was described by others as the `` best in the business'' in terms of getting the documents, but denied that he had heard <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> described as the `` mother lode.'' In earlier testimony Wednesday, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> employee said he and other company employees were under pressure to get the secret budget documents. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozito </PERSON> said when he was asked by his supervisor to get classified <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> budget documents he turned to <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, an old friend, for help. <PERSON> Lozito </PERSON>, who also was granted immunity, said he got documents from <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> five or 10 times a year, from 1979 to early 1984.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge who grew up in the same neighborhood as the defendant sentenced him to life in prison without parole for possessing 5 -LCB- ounces of crack. `` I do n't feel any pity for him because he set the agenda for himself,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said Wednesday in sentencing <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Winrow </PERSON>. <PERSON> Winrow </PERSON>, 22, was sentenced under a 1988 federal narcotics trafficking statute that provides for severe mandatory penalties for people with multiple drug offenses. <PERSON> Winrow </PERSON> was arrested in December 1988 in a raid on his mother's home He was convicted in August of possession with intent to distribute 5 -LCB- ounces of crack, the potent, highly addictive, smokeable form of cocaine. He had three prior convictions for cocaine possession and was on probation when he was arrested. Under the Anti-Drug Abuse Amendments Act of 1988, <PERSON> Winrow </PERSON> faced a minimum of 20 years in prison and a maximum of life without parole. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> chose the maximum. `` We have one or two things in common,'' the 79-year-old judge told <PERSON> Winrow </PERSON>. `` We are the same race and we come from the same neighborhood.'' The judge, who is black, noted he grew up about a mile from <PERSON> Winrow </PERSON>'s mother's home in south-central <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` I know that neighborhood, and I know how it's changed,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> continued. `` The man is making it one of the neighborhoods you ca n't live in, ca n't walk down the streets on. My people are the victims.'' <PERSON> Winrow </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesnoff </PERSON>, argued against the sentence. He contended the federal statute violates the Constitution by representing cruel and unusual punishment, taking discretion away from judges and failing to match the severity of the crime. But <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the sentence, though harsh, was constitutional. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has gone out to battle the drug war and this man is one of the enemies,'' the judge said.

<HEAD>Debate Rages on Prospects for Global Warming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Despite popular opinion that global warming will disrupt Earth's climate, scientists are still debating whether the `` greenhouse effect'' has started and how bad it will get. `` The scientific community is by no means unanimous,'' <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> meteorologist <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindzen </PERSON> said Wednesday. Because of uncertainty that automobile and industrial pollutants are heating up <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s climate, `` I would be loathe to tell <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> they ca n't build big cars any more or tell <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> to cut oil production,'' said climate researcher <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanography </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jolla </LOCATION>. Debate over global warming took place at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geophysical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s fall meeting. The `` greenhouse effect'' theory says that carbon dioxide and other gases emitted by burning industrial and automobile fuel is accumulating in <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s atmosphere, acting like greenhouse glass to trap heat from sunlight. Computer simulations suggest that by the middle of the next century, <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s average temperature may rise 4 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit, possibly altering storm patterns, triggering droughts and crop failures and raising sea levels to flood low-lying coastal areas. If humans keep burning fossil fuels at present rates, adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, `` by the year 2050 we're going to have tremendous climate changes far outside what man has ever experienced,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Goddard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Lindzen </PERSON> countered: `` It's equally easy to support scenarios where nothing happens.'' He argued that a warming of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s surface spurs creation of more cumulus clouds and makes them rise higher, which in turn blocks enough sunlight to counteract greenhouse heating. <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> said the greenhouse effect's `` potential consequences are scary as hell.'' But he and others question whether computer forecasts of climatological doom are valid. That's because so far they have been unable to find evidence to link greenhouse gases to the one-half-degree warming observed during the past century. Analysis of warming since 1881 shows that most of that increase in global temperature happened before 1919 _ before the more recent, sharp rise in the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Karl </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Climatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Asheville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. While global climate warmed overall since 1881, it actually cooled during the period from 1921 to 1979 before warming again, <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> said. `` In spite of all the well-publicized concern about global warming, you must understand that there is still considerable uncertainty among scientific experts about a number of critical factors which determine global warming,'' <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Knauss </PERSON> said in a statement. The researchers agreed they need to stop arguing and do better research to learn if the greenhouse effect is under way and will be as severe as <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> and others believe. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> spurred controversy when he told a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee hearing during the hot, dry summer of 1988 that he was almost certain greenhouse warming already had begun. Other scientists at Wednesday's news conference said that if that's true, they ca n't detect such warming since it is so small compared to temperature variations caused by changes in solar heat output and other natural factors. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said that to reduce the prospects for radical climate change, there many things that can be done without great cost. Such steps include phasing out chlorofluorocarbon gases _ which harm <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s protective ozone shield and warm the atmosphere _ improving energy efficiency to reduce fuel burning, and recycling newspapers to save trees that consume carbon dioxide, he said.

<HEAD>Pacific Northwest Due for Giant Quake, Studies Suggest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Growing evidence shows a monstrous earthquake could wallop the woefully unprepared <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, followed by tidal waves that would swamp coastal areas of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, scientists say. `` The chances are very high that a great earthquake will occur, yet seismic building codes are notoriously out of date,'' said <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> geophysicist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey geophysicist in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, called the region's ability to prevent death and damage from earthquakes `` abysmal.'' `` We're not prepared in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>,'' he said. While some scientists remain skeptical, evidence accumulated during the last five years indicates six quakes with magnitudes of 8 to 9 rocked the region during the past 3,500 years, making coastal areas suddenly drop so that tsunamis, or seismic tidal waves, inundated the shoreline. The last such quake was about 300 years ago. More studies showing such quakes have occurred and are likely to strike again were released Wednesday during the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geophysical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s fall meeting. Residents of the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> `` should be ready for an earthquake at any time,'' although no one knows how soon, <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> said. One study found the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> coast near <LOCATION> Tillamook </LOCATION> has been rising and tilting eastward much more quickly during the past 50 years than it has on average in 80,000 to 100,000 years. That indicates that stress is building underground, and will be released in a quake measuring 8 to 9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale any time within the next 150 years, according to scientists from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. The study was conducted by <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. Dozens of dead western cedar trees along <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s southern coast were studied by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON>, a forester at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON> said that by dating the trees' rings, he determined they all died suddenly about 300 years ago, when coastal land suddenly dropped during a major quake and tsunamis submerged the trees <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON> said the trees were found along a 60-mile coastal stretch, suggesting the quake measured 8 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinhart </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> presented a study showing 300-year-old peat buried by sand has been found along at least a 120-mile stretch of the Oregon-Washington coast. She said it indicates a 40-foot-high tsunami dumped sand on coastal estuaries in a big quake three centuries ago. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> is severely unprepared for the `` great seismic hazard.'' The lack of recent big quakes lulled Oregonians into a false sense of security, and the state has made little progress updating building codes to take large quakes into account, he added. <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state is slightly better prepared because building standards were improved after a magnitude-7 .1 quake in <LOCATION> Olympia </LOCATION> in 1949 and a magnitude-6 .5 quake near <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> in The two quakes killed 17 people. Geological Survey geologist <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckham </PERSON> found new evidence that one and possibly two quakes measuring about 7 rocked <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> at least 1,200 years ago. He found that land on <LOCATION> Bainbridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> west of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> was suddenly uplifted by as much as 23 feet at the time. A magnitude-7 .3 quake in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> several years ago raised land there by about 16 feet Two large plates of Earth's crust collide off the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>. The Juan de Fuca plate, which is under the seafloor, is diving eastward under the North American plate beneath <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in a process is called subduction. Quakes can happen in subduction zones when one plate sticks to the other until so much stress builds up they snap apart in a giant temblor. That caused the 1985 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> earthquakes, which killed about 10,000 people, and the two largest quakes ever recorded: the 1960 <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> quake that killed about 5,000 people and measured 9.5, and the 1964 <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> quake that claimed 131 lives and measured 9.2. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Sykes </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Lamont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doherty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION>, said other scientists `` have too quickly jumped on the big earthquake scenario'' for the Northwest. He believes the <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuca </PERSON> plate is warmer and softer than the plates off <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. In that case, the plate could dive smoothly under <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> without sticking and snapping. But <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said if that were true, the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> would have `` the only major subduction zone which does not cause substantial earthquakes.''

Now <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> have spent weeks trying to establish their political differences and prove their interest in representing a district said to be among the nation's poorest. `` My campaign is a movement,'' said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` It's an opportunity for people to get involved in politics again.'' An attorney and a former law school instructor, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, 48, has been state senator since 1983 after serving 10 years in the House. He captured 41 percent of the vote in the Nov. 7 election, compared with 34 percent for Hall. The two topped a field of 11 candidates seeking to succeed <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>. The term expires in 1990. `` I won in the black community and the white community and the Hispanic community,'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said. `` And I intend to do exactly the same thing on Dec. 9.'' A poll published Monday by <ORGANIZATION> KPRC-TV </ORGANIZATION> showed the race is nearly deadlocked. The <ORGANIZATION> KPRC </ORGANIZATION> poll said 41 percent of voters favor <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, while 38 percent were for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Twenty-one percent said they were undecided, and the poll had a 5 point margin of error. Hall, 45, has a more buttoned-down style. Also an attorney, he gained early notice as a decorated <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran who returned to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> questioning discriminatory practices in housing and employment. More recently, he has worked to set up 50 `` Just Say No'' anti-drug programs for 1,300 students. `` I have a vision that indeed we can do better than we do now at solving the problems that we face as a community,'' said <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, a three-term legislator who has served as councilman since 1979. Hall, who had been a high school friend of <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s, lost a bitter battle to him for the congressional seat in 1978, when the two fought to succeed <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>. Hall had to give up his re-election bid for the council to run for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Mayor <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON> has endorsed his bid for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and helped him raise money. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> agree many issues: both favor increased funding to battle drug trafficking and abuse, and for health care to the poor and elderly and military cutbacks in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` What differences there are largely is a matter of style,'' says <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a political scientist at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> comes off as the more grassroots kinds of campaigner _ more of the people's candidate. While Hall has the more polished image, as the sort of professional candidate. But both of them are extremely professional and long-term political people.''

<HEAD>Study Finds Intentional Injuries Common Among Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One in every 130 children require hospital care each year for injuries resulting from fights, suicide attempts and other intentional acts of violence, according to a study published today. Intentional injuries are now recognized as a major cause of death among children and teen-agers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The latest research was intended to see how often violence results in significant but non-fatal injuries. The study, based on <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> data gathered a decade ago, found that such harm is relatively common, especially among city dwellers and poor people. It found that intentional injuries made up 3 percent of all injuries to children and teen-agers. They led to 10 percent of all hospitalizations and 16 percent of all injury-related deaths. Overall, 85 percent of the intentional injuries resulted from assaults, such as fights, rape and child battering. The analysis was conducted by Dr. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Guyer </PERSON> and colleagues from the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>. It was conducted between 1979 and 1982 in 14 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> communities and published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Among the findings: _ One in 42 adolescent boys was treated annually for an assault-related injury, usually resulting from a fight _ Boys were almost twice as likely as girls to seek care for intentional injuries _ One exception was suicide attempts, which were nearly twice as frequent among girls One in every 303 adolescent girls needed hospital care for a self-inflicted injury each year. _ Nearly one-quarter of the rapes occured in girls under age 10 _ Assault-related injuries were three times as common in cities as in suburbs

<TEXT>
 Stung by electoral successes of the extreme right and fierce debate over rights for Moslems, the government has appointed a trouble-shooter to formulate new policy for integrating immigrants into French society. Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> on Wednesday named <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Prevot </PERSON> as permanent secretary of a government committee that will grapple with what has become the leading issue in domestic politics. `` The economic situation of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> no longer permits us to be a land of immigration,'' government spokesman <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pensec </PERSON> said after the appointment was announced at the weekly Cabinet meeting. `` It's now a question of integrating foreigners who have come to make their homes here and wish to live here permanently,'' <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pensec </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Prevot </PERSON>, 61, will head a task force of 13 ministers to grapple with the issues of integrating Moslems into the secular school system, the definition of a political refugee, illegal workers and immigrant housing. The panel will submit conclusions to the government sometime after Jan. 31. The creation of the task force represents a victory for the extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> headed by <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>, who has fulfilled a long-held goal of putting immigration high on the government's agenda. It comes the same day <PERSON> Marie-France </PERSON> <PERSON> Stirbois </PERSON> took the party's first seat in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> since electoral reforms in 1988 Mrs. <PERSON> Stirbois </PERSON> won the seat for suburban <ORGANIZATION> Dreux </ORGANIZATION> in a runoff election Sunday. Immigration exploded into a front-page issue in October after three girls with North African origins insisted on wearing Islamic scarves to their junior high school. French law dating to the turn of the century separates church and state. All forms of proselytizing and wearing of religious symbols are prohibited in the secular school system. Though two of the girls removed their scarves and returned to class on Saturday, they ignited fresh debate over whether some immigrants can be absorbed into French culture. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> has pushed the issue for years, arguing that social payments to immigrants cut into benefits for native French citizens. His party fares well in areas like <LOCATION> Dreux </LOCATION> that have a high population of non-European immigrants. In an interview published in Wednesday's edition of the conservative newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Figaro </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> urged the government to expel all foreigners who arrived in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> after 1974. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> says a law passed that year that restricted immigration to political asylum or reuniting families is widely flouted. `` Wisdom would dictate reducing the number of foreigners in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and reversing the flood,'' <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` In 10 years there will be 100 million people living in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. What is their hope? To come to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.'' He continued: `` Is that the solution? Of course not. The solution is the development of the underdeveloped countries.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> has won 9 to 14.5 percent of the vote nationwide vote in recent elections. The debate over immigration almost never mentions immigrants from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but focuses instead on <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and black <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where many countries are former French colonies or protectorates. A survey of 926 people conducted by the polling service <ORGANIZATION> BVA </ORGANIZATION> showed 68 percent of the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> think the level of tolerance has been reached for immigration, and 50 percent oppose the construction of new mosques. The last national census, taken in 1982, showed 3.6 million immigrants living in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The Ministry of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> puts the current figure at 4.5 million, or about 8 percent of a total population of 55 million. The ministry's last breakdown, in 1985, showed <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> as the most numerous immigrant population at 846,488, followed by Algerians at 725,049, Moroccans at 558,799, Italians at 378,339, Spaniards at 353,232, Tunisians at 225,730 and Turks at 160,140.

 Actor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kringle </PERSON>'s lawyer who proved that <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> exists in the 1947 Christmas film classic `` Miracle on 34th Street,'' has died. He was 77. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>, a leading man in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> musicals and dramas during the 1940s and 1950s, died his home here Wednesday, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, a longtime friend and former publicist. He suffered from heart problems. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>'s third wife, actress <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, and his three children from previous marriages were with him when he died, <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said. `` Miracle on 34th Street,'' which won three Oscars and has become a Christmas TV tradition, also starred <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON>, <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Gwenn </PERSON> and an 8-year-old <PERSON> Natalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> as a girl who did n't believe in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>'s character is called upon to defend <PERSON> Kringle </PERSON>, the department store <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> who faces court proceedings because of his insistence he is really <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>. The lawyer wins by getting postal officials to deliver to <LOCATION> Kringle </LOCATION> in court thousands of children's letters for <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Claus </PERSON>. The judge decides not to refute a government agency and frees the kindly old man in time to make his Christmas Eve rounds. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> took personal credit for getting the movie. He spotted the <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> story in a magazine and overcame objections from 20th Century <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> studios to making a simple Christmas story in an era of extravagant productions. It was broadcast on local TV station Tuesday. `` He was very proud of that film,'' said <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>. `` In fact, the night before he died _ he was unconscious in bed _ a television in the corner was playing that film. It was strange looking at him in bed like that.'' <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, the son of a gentleman farmer who lost much of his wealth in the stock market crash of 1929. His mother was an opera singer. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> studied drama and voice at Juilliard and <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, supporting himself with roles in low-budget <PERSON> Shubert </PERSON> shows. He once had his own radio program on <ORGANIZATION> WNEW </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> first made his mark in film as a leading man in several 20th Century Fox musicals in the 1940s, often starring opposite <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> or <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Grable </PERSON>. His films include `` Tin Pan Alley,'' `` Sun Valley Serenade,'' `` Hello Frisco Hello,'' `` Springtime in the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION>,'' `` The Dolly Sisters,'' `` The Razor's Edge'' and `` Sentimental Journey.'' In the 1950s, <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> switched to Westerns and action pictures, including `` Passage West,'' `` Raiders of the Seven Seas,'' and `` Santa Fe Passage.'' <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> retired in the 1960s, but went back to the stage with Miss <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> in the 1973 national revival of `` Good News.'' <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> said of his acting career in 1974: `` I could never quite take it seriously.'' `` It was all kind of fun ...

<HEAD>New York Survey: Almost All Supermarket Scanners Overcharge</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Customers of supermarkets with automatic checkout scanners were overcharged in 32 of the 33 stores checked by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state inspectors this year, officials said. The 32 stores, which include all of the major supermarket chains, were fined a total of $ 5,015 for the violations, said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrara </PERSON>, assistant director of food inspection services for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> and Markets. More than 5 percent of the items in a typical store are mispriced in favor of the supermarket, <PERSON> Ferrara </PERSON> said. Nonetheless, state officials were unable to say Wednesday whether the customers at the 32 stores ended up net winners or losers because of the scanners. Industry officials noted that the scanners might also be undercharging customers on some of the many items checked in each supermarket. `` I think they -LRB- consumers -RRB- have to pay careful attention to the prices marked as opposed to the prices on the scanners,'' <PERSON> Ferrara </PERSON> said. `` It's not uncommon for them to be overcharged for items in stores that use scanners. I guess ` buyer beware' would probably be good advice.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON>, director of government relations for the state <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said mistakes are made that both benefit and hurt consumers. So while 32 of the 33 stores were found to be overcharging on some items, they may have been undercharging on many others, said the lobbyist. `` People are n't going to knowingly cheat their customers because they'll lose them,'' <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> said. `` You might fool someone once or twice, but if you lose that person and they never come back, you're not going to be in business for very long. <PERSON> Ferrara </PERSON> said inspectors, posing as customers, would go into stores and buy about 150 items or more, comparing prices on the product with the receipt after checking out. Stores where discrepancies were found that hurt the consumers were fined. Many of the mistakes came in items that were advertised as on sale, but the sale price had n't been entered into the computer scanner, he said.

Ambassador <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> lives, some residents stood on the street and cheered. `` We have won some victories,'' said rebel Capt. <PERSON> Danilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lim </PERSON>. `` We have made a very strong statement.'' At least 79 people have been killed and more than 570 others wounded in the coup attempt. It was the bloodiest of the six attempts to overthrow Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who took power in the February 1986 civilian-military uprising that toppled the late President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who faced the gravest crisis of her administration, said she was relieved the siege was over. `` We must now all join hands and consolidate our resources to rebuild what has been destroyed,'' she said in a written statement. At <LOCATION> Mactan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, rebel leader Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Commendador </PERSON> threatened to blow up all military aircraft unless his demands were met. Military Chief of Staff Gen. <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> begged Commendador in a television statement to spare the aircraft, saying they were needed for the fight against <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> insurgents. But as representatives of the two sides watched the telecast in <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION>, a rebel officer turned off the set before de Villa appeared. Cardinal <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> archbishop of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and the country's leading cleric, called on todayu his followers to join a mass rally Friday in support of democracy. `` The future of the nation is in your hands,'' <PERSON> Sin </PERSON> said. In 1986, hundreds of thousands joined <PERSON> Sin </PERSON>'s call to turn out in the streets to support soldiers who had mutinied against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. That triggered the `` people power revolution'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> rode to power. But much of her public support has now eroded amid charges of incompetence and corruption. On Wednesday, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> declared a national state of emergency to deal with the crisis. Her staff was expected to send <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a list of new powers requested under the emergency decree. Rebels abandoned <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION> a day after about 1,800 foreigners, among them roughly 250 Americans, were evacuated from rebel-held luxury hotels there. As they left the skyscrapers and hotels, seized on Saturday, the mutineers sang the theme song of their Scout Ranger regiment. Rifles, bazookas, machine guns and bandoleers of ammunition were slung over their shoulders. `` We will not surrender, even if it takes forever,'' said Cpl. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bantung </PERSON>. `` The government must change.'' Rebels have accused Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> of failing to stamp out corruption, reorganize the armed forces and deliver on promises of social justice. The rebels seized hotels and buildings in <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION> on Saturday. The military said about 300 rebels surrendered today, but the number appeared to be more than 500. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> estimated that about 3,000 rebels joined the mutiny at its high-point. On Sunday, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> ruled out negotiations with the rebels and warned them `` surrender or die.'' But in the end she relented and stepped aside to allow loyal military commanders to resolve the crisis peacefully. Most rebel officers in past coup attempts have simply been confined to barracks, and many enlisted men were sent back into the ranks. <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> said the rebels' political demands, which included the resignation of Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, `` were non-negotiable.'' The rebels were believed to favor a civilian-military junta that would pave the way for new elections. On Friday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-4 Phantom jets flew air cover for loyalist forces, preventing the insurgents from continuing air strikes from <LOCATION> Villamor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, which the rebels seized in the coup's first hours. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warplanes did not fire on the rebels. Public confidence has been shaken far more than by the other coup attempts. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, governor of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday that $ 91 million had been withdrawn in runs on <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> banks. Many parts of the archipelago had cash shortages because domestic air service had been suspended.

 State gaming regulators have fined a casino $ 250,000 for removing black and women employees from a table at the request of a big-stakes player. The penalty approved unanimously by the <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday stopped short of the closure suggested by the state Division of Gaming Enforcement, which did not propose any length to a shutdown. However, it exceeded an administrative law judge's recommendation that the casino be fined $ 15,600, the amount lost by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> LiButti </PERSON>, the player in question The fine was the second largest in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s 11-year casino history. The largest was a $ 257,000 penalty issued against Caesars for allowing a patron to play from inside the pit, among other charges. In 1985, the gaming hall became the only casino to be closed for a day when it allowed a patron to lose more than $ 7 million without checking his source of credit. `` A suspension of the operation certificate is not warranted in this instance,'' said commission Chairman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Read </PERSON>. `` But the evidence also establishes sufficiently aggravating circumstances to warrant nothing less than maximum penalties.'' Read cited `` the inherently abhorrent nature of race - and sex-based discrimination'' and the gaming hall's catering to high rollers The commission decision also requires Caesars to conduct a training program emphasizing how to deal with high-rollers. <PERSON> LiButti </PERSON>, a 57-year-old thoroughbred horse consultant from <LOCATION> Saddle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, has said through his attorney that he never asked for the removal of dealers. He is suing Caesars and the Division of Gaming Enforcement for making the allegations. The gaming division's discrimination complaint against <ORGANIZATION> Caesars </ORGANIZATION> charges that on two occasions in May 1988, <PERSON> Caesars </PERSON> removed black and women craps workers to accommodate <PERSON> LiButti </PERSON>. Although the ruling was unanimous, <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Waters </PERSON>, the lone black member of the five-person commission, questioned its impact on Caesars. `` It is obvious that organizational or corporate penalties represent nothing more than the cost of doing business,'' Waters said. `` If violations of this sort occur in the future, I think this commission must consider assessing penalties against top management in order to hold them personally accountable.'' Caesars attorney <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Parliman </PERSON> said he was `` pleased that the commission decided not to accept the recommendation to suspend the license.'' The casino collects about $ 851,000 a day from patrons before expenses. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Respes </PERSON>, the black floorperson who was replaced, also said he was satisfied by the ruling. `` I'm happier with this decision than a $ 15,000 fine,'' Respes said. Respes, 36, said he still works for Caesars, but added it has not been easy. `` I was vey humiliated,'' he said. `` My pride was hurt. I could n't believe the company would do such a thing.''

 A government witness in a drug smuggling trial claimed he once gave Panamanian Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> a $ 300,000 present, and implicated the manager of rock star <LOCATION> Bon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jovi </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalish </PERSON>, 37, faced cross-examination today at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> trial of 23 men accused of an enormous smuggling conspiracy. In testimony Tuesday, <PERSON> Kalish </PERSON> said the Panamanian government helped him get in and out of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, once warning him that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> was watching his jet so he could arrange for another. <PERSON> Kalish </PERSON> said he met <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in the fall 1983 through <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Pretel </PERSON>, the Panamanian strongman's partners in the firm of <ORGANIZATION> Servicios </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Touristicos </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kalish </PERSON>, the 70th witness to testify in a trial which began in late October, said he told <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pretel </PERSON> that he expected to have $ 100 million and needed adequate banking protection for the money. Soon afterward, he met <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The day after that, he said, he was taken to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s home and gave the general a $ 300,000 gift. `` I am rather impressed that I am in this man's house,'' said <PERSON> Kalish </PERSON>, who often spoke of the past in the present tense. He said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> agreed to help with banking channels in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pretel </PERSON> divided a 5 percent commission on $ 2.5 million sent to deposit in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kalish </PERSON> also testified Tuesday that <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> `` Doc'' <PERSON> McGhee </PERSON>, manager of the rock groups <LOCATION> Bon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jovi </LOCATION>, Skid Row and the Scorpions, was the link between the smugglers and a Colombian drug supplier. At a meeting in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kalish </PERSON> testified, <PERSON> McGhee </PERSON> was told to ask one of his associates _ <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baranquilla </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> _ to supply a boat loaded with 40,000 to 50,000 pounds of marijuana for shipment to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> in November 1982. The Colombian <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> seized the boat and towed it to <LOCATION> Cartegena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, he said. But, <PERSON> Kalish </PERSON> testified, a $ 100,000 bribe from <LOCATION> Vargas </LOCATION> _ paid with the assurance that <PERSON> McGhee </PERSON> would repay <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> _ persuaded the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> crew to let the drug boat free and help load it. <PERSON> McGhee </PERSON>, who got a suspended sentence after pleading guilty to marijuana importation charges in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, faces more charges in <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, where he is among about two dozen defendants to be tried later. <PERSON> Kalish </PERSON> described their marijuana enterprise as a multimillion-dollar business with so much cash that banks could n't handle it At one point, he said, the organization had `` $ 40 million and no place to put it.'' Organization members are accused of smuggling about 48,000 pounds of marijuana into <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> in 1982, nearly 300,000 pounds into <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> in 1983 and plotting to bring one million pounds into <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> in 1984. The 1984 operation never materialized, however, because <PERSON> Kalish </PERSON> was arrested for racketeering. He subsequently pleaded guilty to continual criminal enterprise and was sentenced to 14 years in prison. The prison term later was reduced to 10 years after <PERSON> Kalish </PERSON> began cooperating with federal authorities. In testimony about another defendant, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kalish </PERSON> testified that he visited an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> farm soon after the delivery of 280,000 pounds of marijuana to a shipyard near <LOCATION> Abbeville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. He said some of the marijuana had been taken to the farm for distribution. A problem developed, he said, when it was discovered the people who owned the farm were selling their own marijuana crop. `` One of the kids at the farm is selling bags of marijuana to the kids in town,'' <PERSON> Kalish </PERSON> said. `` We have 45,000 pounds of marijuana in this barn and here's this kid selling little Baggies of marijuana and causing a security problem.''

 The last day of class before final exams. A bustling university building filled with holiday decorations and serious students chasing those elusive engineering degrees. Abruptly, a man enters the modern, six-story school structure, ammunition belts criss-crossing his chest, a semi-automatic assault rifle in his hands. Shots, screams echo through the halls. For a second, <PERSON> Jean-Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cadieux </PERSON> thinks it is only a pre-exam prank. `` One of my friends said, ` If it's a gag, it's a good one. There's a bloody corpse by the photocopy machine,''' said the 23-year-old student. By the time the unidentified gunman was through stalking the classrooms and corridors Wednesday of the engineering school at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION>, 14 women were dead, nine women and four men were wounded. The gunman, a brown-haired, blue-eyed man clad in blue jeans, work boots and a green-and-black sweater, killed himself on the third floor of the building. Frantic parents rushed to the school as pandemonium erupted. Stunned students walked trance-like on the snow-covered campus of the sprawling university that rests on a hill overlooking the city. `` I saw death close up and I shook,'' said <PERSON> Vanthona </PERSON> <PERSON> Ouy </PERSON>, 22, one of scores of horrified students who streamed out of the building after the carnage. `` It's our friends who have been killed.'' `` It was just like Rambo,'' said student <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Leclerc </PERSON>. `` He had at least two ammunition belts across his chest.'' <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiffault </PERSON>, 23, a student, said the gunman walked into a third-floor classroom and said, `` Everybody out!'' When no one left, the gunman began shooting. <PERSON> Thiffault </PERSON> said a friend, who was standing close by, was shot, as was another woman crouched between desks. Asked why he had n't been killed, <PERSON> Thiffault </PERSON> kept repeating, `` I do n't know.'' The gunman entered a cafeteria first, killing three women, then moved up to a second-floor classroom, where he ordered the men out and fired on a group of frightened young women, killing six. `` He came in quietly,'' said student <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavarie </PERSON>, who was among the men ordered out of that classroom. `` And he told us to stop what we were doing. Everyone thought it was a joke. `` He was smiling at us. He was very calm.'' No one moved, <PERSON> Chavarie </PERSON> said. `` Then he fired a shot, right by my ear.'' <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, 25, who was also in the classroom, said `` I thought it was a blank. I did n't see anything on the wall. But it made a very loud noise. `` When he came in he was really calm but after the first shot his voice became nervous.'' Distraught, horrified parents frantically sought information about their children. The university turned into a temporary morgue. School officials urged students to let their parents know they were safe. Students and professors, their voices trembling from fear and shock, stood by the building in the cold <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> evening. One of the first police officers on the scene learned first-hand that his daughter was among the victims, according to a university spokesman. <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Leclair </PERSON>, the police's head of public relations, found his daughter, <PERSON> Maryse </PERSON>, dead on the floor, university spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Doin </PERSON> said. `` She was a really nice girl, very clever. She was a brilliant student,'' <PERSON> Doin </PERSON> said. Some parents went to an auditorium at the school waiting to learn if their children were among the dead. Some were in tears, others waited with their heads in their hands. As many as 200 police officers were on the scene, including a heavily armed <ORGANIZATION> SWAT </ORGANIZATION> team that arrived in the first, most confused moments. The university is the largest in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s majority French-speaking province, with some 50,000 students in 13 faculties and about 60 departments.

 Congressional investigators are turning up evidence of possibly widespread security problems at the Energy Department's nuclear weapons plants, which already are under the gun for extensive safety and environmental flaws. Little has been documented of security lapses, mainly because details about protection of plutonium and other nuclear materials are classified. As a result of congressional inquiries, however, once-secret information is trickling out. Some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and private experts say the emerging evidence points to an unnerving vulnerability to diversion of bomb-grade plutonium to terrorists. `` The questions of diversion and the pathways of diversion are extremely numerous,'' said <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoenig </PERSON>, scientific director of the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a private group that advocates measures to control the spread of nuclear weapons. Despite the government's devotion to secrecy in matters of nuclear weapon production, it appears some federal nuclear facilities have run the risk in recent years of allowing the theft of enough plutonium to build a nuclear bomb. Government documents also suggest that some <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials have played down protection problems. Other officials complain that budget constraints have prevented the department from filling security posts with adequately trained people. Among security slips disclosed this week by a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> investigations subcommittee: _ <ORGANIZATION> Argonne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory-West </ORGANIZATION>, near <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, violated rules last year on controlling access to portable plutonium at a nuclear reactor site at the lab Details of the incident are classified, but a senior <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official told a closed hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> investigations subcommittee that the violation `` revealed a deficiency and vulnerability'' to diversion of bomb materials to terrorists. Portions of the hearing transcript were declassified earlier this week. The official, <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rauch </PERSON>, manager of the regional <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> office that manages the <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> facility, did not dispute a suggestion by Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Minn </LOCATION>., that the incident meant `` people could be carting plutonium out of the place. <PERSON> Rauch </PERSON> stressed that the problem has since been corrected. _ Quantities of plutonium large enough to make a nuclear bomb were left unattended in rooms without alarms at <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livermore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> last spring A previously secret inspection report on <PERSON> Livermore </PERSON> also said large quantities of plutonium `` were often left, between process steps, with only one person or unattended'' during normal business hours. Department officials acknowledged to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that this was a serious lapse of security. _ A senior department official, Brig Gen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kavanaugh </PERSON>, expressed concern in an internal memorandum last April at the frequency of `` marginal and unsatisfactory ratings'' of nuclear material security by federal inspectors of weapons plants. `` If, within the DOE, we can not articulate and enforce effective security practices at our most sensitive facilities, we will deserve the comments of our most vocal critics,'' wrote <PERSON> Kavanaugh </PERSON>, who left the department shortly after sending his memo. <PERSON> Kavanaugh </PERSON> also drafted a tough-worded message that he suggested be sent to managers of key weapons plants requiring immediate action to improve nuclear materials security. A few weeks later, a brief version of his proposed message was sent offering thanks for previous efforts but making scant mention of the problems. The subcommittee is investigating why the draft <PERSON> Kavanaugh </PERSON> message was watered down by his superiors. Security questions also have arisen at the <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> weapons complex in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., expressed alarm that responsibility for granting security clearances was taken away from <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>'s security officials and given to the personnel office Also, a laboratory at <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> was unsure for more than a year, starting in August 1988, whether a substantial amount of tritium _ a gas used to make nuclear warheads _ had been stolen from a loading facility. The department said last week that it was confident that none had been lost, but some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> say doubts remain about <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>'s ability to protect tritium supplies.

<HEAD>President Cuts Mandatory Military Service Period In Half</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> announced a major defense cutback today, including a reduction from two years to one year of the mandatory period of initial military service for white men. He said certain military units would be eliminated and facilities closed, with details to be disclosed next year. The announcement came two weeks after <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> completed the withdrawal of its troops from <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, where since 1966 they had fought a bush war against pro-independence guerrillas. A year ago, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> signed a treaty that cleared the way for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s independence and also halted South African involvement in the civil war in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s northern neighbor. These diplomatic developments have prompted speculation that a major cut in military spending is imminent. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, opening a new headquarters for the state arms manufacturing corporation, indicated that conscripts already in the military would have their terms of service shortened. He said details about this would be disclosed Friday. The president said it was possible that career military personnel and employees of <ORGANIZATION> Armscor </ORGANIZATION>, the weapons company, might lose their jobs as part of the cutback. He said efforts would be made to find new jobs for these people. It was the second time in 10 days that the president had announced steps which reduce the scope of military operations and influence. On Nov. 28, he scrapped a nationwide security network which critics had denounced as an unaccountable shadow government. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s predecessor, P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, had been criticized for giving the security forces too large a role in policy-making. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> quit in August after losing a power struggle with de Klerk. Under the current conscription system, all able-bodied white males in South African are required to serve two years of initial military duty and then are eligible for call-up camps that could amount to two more years of service spread out over 20 or more years. Military service for blacks, Asians and people of mixed-race is voluntary. In September, 780 white men vowed not to perform military service, the largest defiance ever of conscription laws. Draft resisters face prison terms of up to six years, or 1 -LCB- times the amount of unfulfilled service. Three men currently are serving six-year terms _ the youngest, 19-year-old <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bester </PERSON>, completed a full year of his sentence on Tuesday. The government does not release information on the manpower of the armed forces. However, at any given time in recent years, there have been as estimated 68,000 conscripts on active duty and about 325,000 men in the reserves out of the roughly 2.4 million white males of all ages in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.

 Former <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said in videotaped testimony that his government collected information on dissident activities in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who died in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> Sept. 28, said in a video deposition he became fearful of anti-Marcos protests in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by 1984, when `` massive, black propaganda'' was mounted against his regime. Asked whether four Philippine agencies, including the military and the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, would have been involved in collecting intelligence in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> replied: `` Among other things, most probably, yes.'' Shown in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, the videotape was made in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> in July 1986, five months after <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was overthrown in a popular revolt. The late <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, his widow, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, and others are being sued for $ 30 million by the families of Silme <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Viernes </PERSON>, union reformers and anti-Marcos activists who were fatally shot in June 1981 in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> offices of the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cannery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. The suit claims <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' government ordered the killings based on an intelligence network in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that monitored anti-Marcos activists, including <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> and Viernes. Local prosecutors contended the killings involved an internal union dispute. Three men were convicted of the murders in a 1981 criminal trial. Philippine intelligence in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would have been the same as any other country's, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said in the video. `` Every embassy, including the American embassy ... have reports of this nature of those who are against the government in either a benign way or a vicious way,'' he said. `` I never heard of any serious effort of infiltrating any anti-Marcos organizations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Shortly before their deaths, <PERSON> Viernes </PERSON> had carried money to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and met with anti-Marcos labor union officials there, and he and <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> supported a resolution at a labor convention in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> calling for an investigation of labor conditions in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>.

But he said the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> intelligence apparatus contained `` funds that are considered held at the discretion of some of the officers.''

 New Prime Minister V.P. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION>'s holiest shrine today and told an estimated 20,000 Sikhs to help him stop the sectarian violence that has cost thousands of lives. `` Too much bloodshed has taken place in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> told the Sikhs gathered inside the sacred Golden Temple. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> was the first by a prime minister since <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> in June 1984, when she ordered a bloody crackdown on Sikh extremists. Four months later, she was assassinated by two of her Sikh guards. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s visit is part of his new government's initiative to solve the Sikh separatist campaign. More than 7,500 people have died in the 8-year-old campaign for the homeland that Sikh extremists propose to carve out of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, a rich farming state bordering <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a Hindu, traveled in an open jeep. `` Your love to me is my security,'' he told the Sikhs who lined up the 2-mile route and cheered him. He gave autographs to Sikh children and shook hands. `` My government will move fast to bring peace and prosperity in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, 58, told the Sikhs gathered in the 14th century Golden Temple. `` I have not come here for any political or governmental purposes,'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said. `` I have come to perform prayer in the holy shrine so that peace and normalcy can be restored in the state once again.'' The shrine was the scene of a fierce battle when it was attacked by Indian troops to flush out Sikh militants entrenched inside. More than 1,200 people, mostly Sikhs, were killed in the 1984 army operation that precipitated the revenge slaying of Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. Sikhs, whose religion is rooted in both Islam and <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION>, comprise just 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 880 million people but have a slight majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. Sikh militants claim the government in the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION> nation discriminates against them socially and politically. Hindus make up 82 percent of the population. <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> took office last month after elections that ended the tenure of <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s son and immediate successor. The new government issued formal orders Dec. 2 to free top Sikh leaders from jails, including a new member of Parliament who was accused of plotting the 1984 assassination of Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Simranjit </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, a former police officer accused of conspiracy, was released from jail after the government withdrew cases against him. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> was elected to the lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> by an overwhelming majority in last month's national elections Other leaders released were <PERSON> Gurcharan </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tohra </PERSON>, chief of the Sikh temple management committee, and <PERSON> Prakash </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Badal </PERSON>, a former chief minister of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, 44, who has been jailed for the past five years on sedition charges, was charged with conspiracy when the assassination case was re-opened in April.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has cut off aid to the Comorro Republic until a French mercenary who led a successful coup that claimed the president's life leaves the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> archipelago. In the capital today, soldiers used tear gas and clubs to disperse about 1,000 high school students who marched through the streets to demand that he and the other mercenaries involved in the Nov. 26 takeover leave. The students, carrying placards reading `` mercenaries out'' and `` assassins, assassins,'' gathered in front of the French Embassy. They marched to the beachfront, where they were confronted by dozens of members of the Comoran presidential guard, founded by French mercenary <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Denard </PERSON> and led by about 30 French and Belgian soldiers of fortune. The guardsmen were supported by vehicles equipped with heavy machine-guns. Many students threw themselves into the water when the troops arrived. Others fled. Most later regrouped before the Ministry of the Interior in the city center, where the guardsmen launched tear-gas grenades and charged with clubs. There were no immediate reports of injuries. Several photographers and journalists covering the march had their film and notebooks seized. The demonstration came as <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> cut off its $ 25 million in annual aid to the <LOCATION> Comoro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> over the coup. French government sources in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> said Wednesday that the aid will not be renewed until <PERSON> Denard </PERSON> leaves the islands. Various diplomatic sources have said President <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Abderrahmane </PERSON> died in an attack carried out or directed by <PERSON> Denard </PERSON>, commander of the 500-man guard that diplomats say now controls the island. The guard has reportedly disarmed the 500-man regular army. <PERSON> Denard </PERSON>, who ousted and later returned <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> to the presidency in coups during the 1970s, has denied involvement in the assassination. Students jeered the 60-year-old Frenchman, a convert to Islam married to a Comoro woman, on Tuesday with taunts of `` assassin'' after he left a mosque after saying prayers. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> are the main sources of foreign investment in the archipelago, located midway between <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> demanded an end to the mercenary presence Monday, and both countries are reported to be trying to make a deal with <PERSON> Denard </PERSON> and his men to leave. <PERSON> Denard </PERSON> said Tuesday he has not been approached by <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> officials with such an offer.

 Oscar-winning composer <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fain </PERSON>, whose classic love ballads included `` Love is a Many Splendored Thing'' and `` I'll be Seeing You,'' has died of a heart attack. He was 87. <PERSON> Fain </PERSON>, who was nominated for 10 Academy Awards and won two, died Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Sunshine </PERSON>, a publicist for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Composers </ORGANIZATION>, Authors and Publishers. During a career that stretched from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Tin Pan Alley to <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> wrote some of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most memorable pop hits. Many Fain titles bring instant recognition: `` Secret Love,'' `` Let A Smile Be Your Umbrella,'' `` Wedding Bells Are Breaking Up That Old Gang of Mine'' and `` Tender is the Night'' among them. `` ` I'll Be Seeing You' _ just think of how often we say that. But when you say it a certain way, it means something very deep,'' <ORGANIZATION> ASCAP </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> said of the World War II song. `` It's hard for me to believe I wo n't be seeing him anymore He was such a sweet person, such a gentle person.'' <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cahn </PERSON>, a decades-long colleague and collaborator, said his friend leaves `` not just a few but a staggering medley of hits, songs that are readily identifiable to everyone.'' He added: `` You know, old songwriters never really die because their songs keep them alive forever.'' <PERSON> Fain </PERSON>'s collaborators included lyricists <PERSON> Cahn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahal </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilliard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Mitchell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parish </ORGANIZATION>, E.Y. <PERSON> Harburg </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> did n't study at Juilliard. He played the piano by ear. He was self-taught, but he wrote some of the most beautiful standard melodies,'' said Parish in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The two men wrote `` You're So Indifferent'' for <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> and another tune, `` In a Little French Cafe.'' `` When a writer sat down in those days to write a song, he did n't sit down to write a standard,'' Parish said. `` We wrote songs that we felt inside of our hearts _ to have people sing and dance to, and for kids to whistle in the streets. `` Workmen, whatever they were doing, would be singing strains of our songs ... That explains why these songs are still alive.'' <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> won Oscars for the title tune from the 1955 movie `` Love Is a Many Splendored Thing'' and in 1953 for `` Secret Love'' from the Doris Day film `` Calamity <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>.'' Born <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Feinberg </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on June 17, 1902, <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> was a piano prodigy who unsuccessfully worked <ORGANIZATION> Tin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alley </ORGANIZATION> until teaming with <PERSON> Kahal </PERSON> for their first hit, `` Nobody Knows What A Red-Headed Mama Can Do.'' He went to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> to work in early musical films, including `` Dames,'' `` Footlight Parade,'' and `` Goin' to Town,'' then returned to <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> and wrote songs for the smash 1938 review `` Hellzapoppin.'' Two songs from a failed <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> musical that year, `` I'll Be Seeing You'' and `` I Can Dream, Ca n't I,'' later became wartime classics. The latter was recorded by the Andrews Sisters. Back in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> after the war, <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hilliard </PERSON> wrote the songs for <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Alice In Wonderland,'' including the tune `` I'm Late.'' He also joined with <PERSON> Cahn </PERSON> to write the score for <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Pan </PERSON>,'' which included the tune `` Second Star to the Right,'' and wrote music for <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Rescuers'' in 1977. <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> is survived by a son, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has passed a bill requiring parental consent for unmarried girls under age 18 to have an abortion in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. The bill passed 65-39 Wednesday after the house rejected nearly 50 amendments, including one to require boys to wear condoms to prevent teen-age pregnancy. It now goes to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which has passed a similar measure and is expected to take action before lawmakers leave for the winter holidays next week. That sets up a promised veto by Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, who has pledged to strike down any measure restricting abortion rights. Opponents of the bill say it is merely intended to make it more difficult for girls to get an abortion. Planned Parenthood officials said at least 70 percent of pregnant minors in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> already bring at least one parent to an abortion clinic with them. `` This bill is meant to put the squeeze on teen-agers with no regard to the horrible alternatives they may seek,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Maxine </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, a Democrat. `` Can any of you live with yourself if a woman resorts to a back-alley abortion, or to crack cocaine to induce abortion, or to suicide? I do n't want any more young people to die.'' Under the legislation, a pregnant girl could petition a probate court to have an abortion if she believes she ca n't tell a parent or if the parent refuses to let her have an abortion. Permission would be required from just one of the parents. `` We're talking about the very bedrock of our society _ family,'' said Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, the bill's sponsor. `` We recognize there are families in trouble, that's why we put the judicial bypass in there.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kandler </PERSON>, spokesman for <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, said the Democratic governor would n't change his mind despite a poll by The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> that said 68 percent of state residents favor a parental consent requirement. `` I'm hopeful the governor will think about parents and not his own personal beliefs,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Listing </PERSON>, president of Right to Life of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Margy </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, said she was encouraged by at least 40 signatures collected on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor asking the governor to veto the bill. That is more than enough to sustain a veto in the 109-member <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, although supporters of the bill say they have enough votes for an override in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile, the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday that the number of abortions in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> during the third quarter of 1989 fell 23 percent from the same period last year. The drop comes on the heels of similar declines reported beginning in late 1988 with the implementation of a ban on state-funded Medicaid abortions for poor women. The 8,696 abortions between July 1 and Sept. 30 compared with 11,358 in the same months in 1988.

<HEAD>Lithuanian Parliament Votes to End Communist Party Supremacy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN IAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Lithuanian parliament voted today to abolish the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s constitutionally guaranteed supremacy and to legalize multiple political parties in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION>, activists said. The move made <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> the first Soviet republic to reject the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s legal lock on power. It also presented a bold challenge to President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who has said that demands for more autonomy in some of the 15 republics are endangering his economic reform program. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also has been trying to crack down on the autonomy movements to reassure orthodox Soviet Communists who have been alarmed by challenges to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> at home and in several Eastern bloc countries. <PERSON> Eduardas </PERSON> <PERSON> Potashinskas </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> activist who has been monitoring the Supreme Soviet's legislative sessions, said the vote today was 243-1, with 39 abstentions. A vote on the same proposal Wednesday fell nine votes short of the two-thirds majority required to pass it. The lawmakers decided to vote again today, in part because 84 deputies were absent and 30 abstained on Wednesday. `` During the session -LRB- today -RRB- of the Supreme Soviet of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, the 6th article of the constitution of the L.S.S.R. was abolished and changed into the new formula which declares a multiparty system,'' the information department of the Lithuanian political movement <ORGANIZATION> Sajudis </ORGANIZATION> said in a telex statement. Sajudis spokesmen said new language recognizes that political parties and movements are within the legal framework of the Lithuanian Constitution. Article 6, which became part of the basic law of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> with the Brezhnev Constitution of 1977, makes the Communist Party the `` leading and guiding force of Soviet society.'' Eliminating it could help reduce the party's grip on on all spheres of life. The Lithuanian action only affects that republic, and is likely to face a stiff challenge from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. A similar proposal in the <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> republic failed Wednesday when the legislature failed to draw a quorum. The Lithuanian party is moving toward a showdown with the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> over its plans to separate from the Soviet Communist Party. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has spoken out sharply against that. The Lithuanians have scheduled a Dec. 19 party congress to decide on the issue. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> all recently dropped similar provisions in their constitutions granting special status to their Communist parties to satisfy pro-democracy movements in their societies. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, green photocopied cards have appeared in metro stations and main streets calling for a two-hour general strike on Monday to ask the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies to rescind the same provision in the national constitution. Human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and five fellow members of the Soviet parliament signed the appeal. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and his fellow deputies are calling for the brief general strike from 10 a.m. to noon on Monday to pressure the national <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> into voting to rescind Article 6 and on draft laws on land, property and business enterprises. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> starts its second semi-annual session Tuesday. `` It is of great importance that Article 6 of the Constitution be abandoned,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was quoted as saying by the Soviet news bulletin <ORGANIZATION> Interfax </ORGANIZATION> published today. `` We can not afford to bob in the wake of changes that are taking place in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, the parliamentary action was preceded by a similar symbolic strike. Czechoslovak strike organizers publicized their plan through massive demonstrations, wall posters, and direct organizing at factories. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was quoted by <ORGANIZATION> Interfax </ORGANIZATION> as saying that dropping the provision from the Soviet constitution `` is extremely important in checking the crisis of confidence in the country.'' The Supreme Soviet, a full-time working legislature, is supposed to hammer out new laws, but its parent body, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, must approve any changes in the Constitution. The Supreme Soviet voted on a proposal in early November to place consideration of Article 6 on the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> agenda, but the proposal defeated by a narrow margin. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is the centerpiece of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s political reforms. Its 2,250 deputies were elected last March in the country's first competitive elections in more than 70 years.

 Bells tolled and mournful chants filled the streets today as <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> marked the one-year anniversary of the earthquake that killed at least 25,000 people. In this mountain city hit hardest by the quake, officials stopped the big town clock forever at 11:41, the minute disaster struck Dec. 7, 1988. `` If only it could all have been a dream, and we could wake up and have everyone here again,'' Armenian poet <PERSON> Maro </PERSON> <PERSON> Marzarian </PERSON> told a crowd of several hundred gathered to dedicate a memorial to <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>'s victims. In a cemetery just outside town, hundreds of families gathered at gravesites, some openly sobbing, others in stony silence. Among the many graves of the earthquake victims were plots for the remains of unidentifiable corpses, with markers reading only `` 238 woman'' or `` 453 child.'' `` Your soul hurts so much you just ca n't express it,'' said <PERSON> Lilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepanian </PERSON>, 25, whose brother, <PERSON> Zillik </PERSON>, and his family were crushed to death in their <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> apartment. `` You remember that on this day, at this time, they were already gone,'' she said. `` At this time one year ago I was standing by our house, only it was n't a house any more.'' She said <PERSON> Zillik </PERSON>'s 3-year-old daughter could be heard crying from the ruins of the house but rescuers could not reach her. `` And the people left alive have such a hard time,'' Ms. <PERSON> Stepanian </PERSON> said. She and her mother have moved to the Armenian capital, <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, until <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> housing can be built for them. They do n't expect that anytime soon. The earthquake measuring 6.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale killed at least 25,000 people and left 500,000 people homeless. A year after the earthquake, 20,000 people are still missing, according to the relief agency Search. The destruction was massive. The town of <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> was leveled. <PERSON> Kirovakan </PERSON> and some 300 villages were shattered. In <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> alone _ then <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s second-largest city with 235,000 people _ the quake destroyed 99 nine-story apartment buildings, 10 schools, and every factory, officials said. The Soviet leadership promised after the quake that <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> and the other demolished communities would be rebuilt within two years.

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on AIDS says it submitted its first report to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> eight months early because the crisis has become too urgent to wait. `` We have heard what people were telling us _ that a crisis situation does exist,'' said Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, vice chairman of the commission that began its work in August. The commission Wednesday released the six-page report it sent to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, calling for `` a national voice'' to repair a health care system that is in danger of crumbling under the weight of a worsening AIDS epidemic. `` The public health care system in this country is not working well and nowhere is that more evident than for people with'' AIDs and people infected with the HIV virus, the cause of AIDS. `` While AIDS is not the cause of the health care system's disarray, it may well be the crisis that could pressure responsible national action to correct its serious shortfalls,'' the report said Among the problems it cites are lack of training support for primary care physicians to treat people with HIV infection and AIDS and low reimbursement rates that discourage physicians from treating Medicaid patients with AIDS. Also, many AIDS patients have no public or private health insurance, which limits their access to life-prolonging drugs, the report said. The commission was required to draft its first report by August 1990. But commissioners told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a letter that testimony they heard during four days of hearings `` was so compelling we felt it is vital to write to you now.'' Dr. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, who as secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> is a non-voting member of the commission, did not participate in writing the report and his press office was not aware of the document until asked about it by reporters. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, said the secretary has expressed concern about some of the same issues addressed by the report. However, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> took issue with the proposition contained in the report that national leadership is lacking. `` There has been leadership from this department and there will continue to be,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said, citing the department's work on AIDS education programs, drug research at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> and federal funds underMedicaid to treat people with AIDS. But the commission said more needs to be done. `` To date, there is no national policy or plan, and no national voice,'' the report said. What's needed, the commission said, is `` frank recognition that a crisis exists in many cities that will require extraordinary measures to overcome.'' The panel recommended creation of a `` flexible, patient-oriented comprehensive system of care,'' and possible creation of a network of regional centers to provide back-up and consultation to primary care physicians treating AIDS patients. It also called for creation of units to treat of HIV patients who are intravenous drug addicts. AIDS is spreading rapidly through needle sharing among drug users, who are passing it to their sexual partners and their children. The advisory commission was created as the follow-on to a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration panel chaired by retired Adm. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> that called for a major escalation of federal efforts to prevent, treat and cure AIDS and for enactment of legislation barring discrimination against victims of the disease. Federal health officials say 112,241 people have been found with AIDS in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since June 1981, and 66,493 of them have died. More than 1 million Americans are believed to be infected with HIV. The commission said that over the next four years AIDS is likely to claim 200,000 lives. The report estimated that direct medical care for people with AIDS in 1991 will cost from $ 2.5 billion to $ 15.1 billion. It notes the range is from less than 1 percent to about 3 percent of total health care spending in the nation. `` We simply must be prepared to make these expenditures,'' the report said.

<HEAD>Communist Program Calls for Elections Soon</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with new party program calling for free

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> published a new program today that calls for free elections as soon as possible and broad cooperation with the opposition in an effort to salvage its diminishing power. The program was announced as representatives of the Communists and opposition opened talks on the country's future. The Communists held a monopoly on power in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for 40 years, but two months of political upheaval have resulted in the loss of its guaranteed leadership role. On Wednesday, former party leader <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> stepped down from his last official post, the presidency, and was replaced by a non-Communist, <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON>, for the first time in the country's 40-year history <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON> will be president until <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> chooses a permanent replacement. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s Politburo and <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> resigned Sunday and were replaced by a 25-member panel of party reformers, who drew up the new program to be discussed at an emergency party congress Friday. `` We support free and secret elections as early as possible, at a time to be set jointly by all political forces,'' said the party program, which was published by the official <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency. It did not suggest a date for elections. The program proposed that all `` newly formed democratic political movements and forces'' work together until the elections. That was a reference to opposition movements such as New Forum that have sprung up in recent weeks. The program also called for a new consitution and new penal and administrative codes. The party newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Neues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deutschland </ORGANIZATION> has indicated that the Communists' traditional leadership hierarchy _ the Politburo and <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> _ will be abolished at the congress. Several East German officials have said the Communists plan to change the party's name to the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, as was done in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> recently. The 25-member panel conceded the party is `` responsible for the deepest crisis in the history of the German Democratic Republic'' and accused `` a certain circle of party functionaries'' of taking part in criminal and unregulated actions,'' according to ADN. `` Only a radical break with -LRB- the party's -RRB- Stalinist basic structures can create a new political home for those in our party who favor a free, just and solidarity-oriented society,'' the panel said. The talks today involved <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> officials and representatives of the main opposition group New Forum and four small political parties that had been <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> allies but broke with the party in recent days. About 300 demonstrators gathered outside the church where the talks were going on, demanding the talks be broadened to include other groups. A trade union representative complained that labor leaders had not been invited to the talks. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> took power Oct. 18 after hard-line leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> was forced to resign amid rising calls for reforms. <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> opened the country's borders and promised sweeping reforms, but his long-time association with the <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> government and growing pressure from the opposition and party ranks finally forced him out. The upheaval set into motion investigations into abuses of power by the ousted <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> elite, whose members allegedly exploited their high position to rob public coffers and live lavish lifestyles. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> and others are under house arrest, and criminal probes are under way. Three former Politburo members, including former economics czar <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mittag </PERSON>, have been arrested. Early today, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinz </PERSON> announced that <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Schalck-Golodkowski </PERSON>, a former leading East German trade official, was in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> prison following an international manhunt. <PERSON> Schalck-Golodkowski </PERSON> is accused of pocketing millions of dollars in illegal arms sales. Groups of demonstrators have been surrounding secret police stations in recent days to prevent former officials from spiriting away incriminating documents that may be used for investigations of former leaders. On Wednesday, the government appealed for `` calm and restraint'' after reports of pro-reform activists seizing secret police facilities in the cities of <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> and Gera. A recently formed citizens action group headquartered in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> claims numerous officials under probe by an official investigative committee have managed to destroy evidence that could be used against them. ADN reported late Wednesday the suicide of an official who had been caught trying to leave a government building in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on Monday with two suitcases stuffed with state funds. The news agency said the man was arrested after trying to remove funds stashed by <PERSON> Schalck-Golodkowski </PERSON>.

<HEAD>2 Top Sheriff's Officials Charged With Obstructing Justice</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Two deputies have been charged with conspiring to delay the court-ordered seizure of property from a financially troubled company, after Mayor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> called the sheriff on behalf of the company's owner. The delay last January gave the businessman time to avoid the seizure by declaring bankruptcy. <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> says he did nothing wrong by referring the businessman to the sheriff and said the grand jury report describing the man as a friend of his was wrong. The two deputies surrendered Wednesday to face charges they conspired to delay the seizure of $ 160,000 worth of machinery from <PERSON> Elijah </PERSON> <PERSON> Medley </PERSON>'s business. A grand jury presentment released Wednesday said <PERSON> Medley </PERSON> faced the seizure after defaulting on about $ 500,000 in loans. The grand jury also raised questions about the involvement of city officials. In <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, grand juries may issue a presentment recommending that a prosecutor charge someone, instead of issuing an indictment bringing the charge itself. `` We are concerned that city officials knowingly abused the power of their office to unfairly benefit one citizen at the expense of other citizens to impede the orderly administration of justice,'' the presentment said. `` We will continue our investigation to determine if there was a systemic abuse of power and to determine whether any other public officials were involved in such conduct.'' The prosecutor is District Attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Castille </PERSON>, a Republican considered to be a mayoral prospect in 1991. <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> and Sheriff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, both Democrats, denied any wrongdoing. `` I did not intervene,'' the mayor told reporters. `` I simply referred a businessman, who is not my friend, to someone who could help him. ... I can assure you that <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Castille </PERSON> knows deep down in his soul that I did nothing wrong.'' `` I do n't do wrong things, and I resent anyone implying that.'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON> also denied wrongdoing, and said he was confident that Chief Deputy <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Graves </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 56, and Lt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, 41, would be exonerated of what he called `` weak charges that have obvious political implications.'' The defendants are accused of `` purposely failing to execute a court-ordered seizure of equipment from <ORGANIZATION> Medley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Model </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Castille </PERSON> said. The seizure was supposed to have been made Jan. 30, but it was delayed and the company filed for bankruptcy Feb. 1. Charges against <PERSON> Graves </PERSON> and <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> include criminal conspiracy and tampering with public records or official information, each a felony punishable by up to seven years in prison. Neither <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Green </PERSON> denied the mayor had made a telephone call on behalf of Medley shortly before the seizure was to have been made. <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> said <PERSON> Medley </PERSON> called him _ the grand jury presentment described the businessman as the mayor's friend, which <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> said was inaccurate _ and asked for help about a `` sheriff's sale'' problem for which he needed more time. <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> said he then called Green at home. The sheriff declined to discuss details of the case, but said he felt it was political. He also said parts of the presentment were inaccurate. <PERSON> Castille </PERSON>, just elected to a second term, said both the mayor and sheriff appeared to have `` played an integral part'' in the case. The presentment said that after the writ was delayed `` Sheriff <PERSON> Green </PERSON> asked Chief Graves, ` Has the mayor's job been taken care of?' -LRB- and -RRB- <PERSON> Graves </PERSON> said that it had.'' The mayor summoned reporters to his City Hall office and denied he had done anything wrong, insisting the phone call from a businessman was normal and that all he did was refer it to the sheriff. Medley could n't be reached by telephone for reaction. His company, though in bankruptcy, is still in business, but telephone calls are taken by an answering service.

<HEAD>Bush Accepts Wall's `Unselfish' Resignation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a letter released today, accepted the resignation of <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> as overseer of the nation's savings and loan institutions and praised the embattled regulator for his `` unselfish'' decision to quit. `` As the first director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thrift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION>, you served during the important organizational phase of the new agency,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told Wall in a four-paragraph letter dated Wednesday. `` I thank you for your hard work in that position, and for your unselfish recognition that the job of revitalizing the industry demands the complete and undistracted attention of the agency's entire leadership and staff,'' the president wrote Wall announced his resignation on Monday, bowing to demands in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that he quit because of his handling of the S & amp; L crisis. Wall took over as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in July 1987. Last August, he became director of the thrift office when the bank board was dismantled under <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L bailout legislation. Wall was the focus of six weeks of hearings by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which was investigating his handling of the failure of <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. It is expected to be the nation's biggest thrift failure at a cost to taxpayers of $ 2 billion. Wall told reporters Monday that he was resigning because continuing the fight with the committee would distract the agency from conducting its work. Meanwhile, Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, accused the administration of `` not having any guts'' for failing to support Wall. <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, who brought Wall to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1975 as his chief aide, made his remarks in an interview with the <LOCATION> Deseret </LOCATION> <LOCATION> News </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> blamed a truck bombing that killed 52 people in the capital on drug traffickers and pledged not to allow <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> democracy to succumb to their `` bloody tyranny.'' Barco went on national television Wednesday night after 1,100 pounds of dynamite were detonated in front of the offices of the secret police in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, gouging out a 20-foot-deep crater and wounding hundreds of people. It was one of the worst terrorist attacks in Colombian history. `` In the last few days, the criminal organization of drug traffickers has begun a vile assault that has cost the lives of many innocent Colombians,'' <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> told his countrymen. Three more bombs exploded in the cocaine-trafficking center of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> just before the speech was transmitted from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> was on a state visit. The bombs, targeting a Mormon temple, an evangelical church and an electronics shop, caused only slight damage and no injuries, police said. Today, a bomb exploded on a road in the northern coastal city of <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION>, killing two policemen in a car, radio reports said. But pamphlets found at the scene suggested the attack was carried out by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, the most active of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s six leftist guerrilla groups. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> said the bombing at federal intelligence police headquarters was part of a string of attacks by drug gangs intended to force the government to stop extraditing to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> traffickers indicted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities. He said traffickers also were responsible for the Nov. 27 bombing of a Colombian jetliner that killed all 107 people aboard, as well as for Tuesday's assassination of a <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> judge. He said the country's resolve to battle traffickers would not waver as a result of their terrorist onslaught. `` They will not succeed in defeating us,'' he said. `` We are fighting and will continue to fight. The war is against all <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, against democracy. We will not allow ourselves to fall to the bloody tyranny of the narcoterrorists.'' The Extraditables, a group linked to the powerful <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel, claimed responsibility for the truck bombing at intellegence police heaquarters. The claim came in a written communique received Tuesday by half a dozen newspapers and radio stations in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. The morning rush hour explosion killed at least 52 people and wounded about 1,000. Aerial photographs showed extensive damage to buildings in a nearly two square mile area. The explosion, felt more than three miles away, caused $ 23 million worth of damage to about 1,500 houses and buildings, including nearby <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> offices. The Extraditables said in their message that they would continue the terrorist campaign until the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approves a national referendum on the country's extradition policy. The Barco administration has sent nine drug suspects to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since decreeing the policy in August, when it declared all-out war on traffickers after they were blamed for the assassination of a popular presidential candidate. However, none of the 12 leading cocaine bosses wanted for extradition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have been caught. On Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> passed a bill that would allow the public to decide in a plebiscite whether the policy should continue. The administration has vehemently opposed the bill, maintaining it would lead to more terrorist violence as traffickers try to intimidate Colombians into rejecting extradition. Today, the head of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, former President <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Turbay </PERSON>, said he would resign if the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> congress approves the bill allowing the referendum on extraditions. <PERSON> Turbay </PERSON> made the announcement in a statement published in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> dailies. In his speech, <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> said the latest terrorist attacks prove the prediction's validity. `` These incidents show what these criminals would do to make sure that the referendum results are in their favor,'' <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> said. There is still no indication on which way the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> might vote on the referendum. But the bombings of the intelligence police offices and the <ORGANIZATION> Avianca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 are likely to strengthen support for the administration's opposition the referendum. `` I was for a dialogue -LRB- with traffickers -RRB- before the bombings, but now, no way,'' said one man interviewed on the news program `` 24 Hours.'' Traffickers have since August been bombing public places, including banks, supermarkets and theaters, in an effort to pressure the government into reversing its decision to extradite. But most of the the 201 previous bombings had been at night and consequently caused relatively few civilian casualties. The campaign had killed 29 people before the latest phase of indiscriminate slaughter began with the bomb aboard the jetliner. The intelligence police chief, Gen. <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Maza </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON>, said Wednesday's truck bomb was an example of the worst type of crime. <PERSON> Maza </PERSON> was in the building at the time of the attack and he said that although he was the main target, the bombing was aimed at all Colombians. `` It was an indiscriminate act against the country, against everything,'' he said in a radio interview late Wednesday with the RCN network.

<UNK>Mitchell Heirs Pleased With Ruling in French Plaigiarism Suit</UNK>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An attorney for <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s heirs said he was pleased with a <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> court's ruling that a French best-seller plagiarized the classic `` Gone With the Wind,'' but said he plans to appeal for more damages. The French court ruled Wednesday that <PERSON> Regine </PERSON> <PERSON> Deforges </PERSON> must pay the <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> estate $ 333,000 in damages and interest because her best-sellr `` The Blue Bicycle'' illegally pirated the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> author's book. The Mitchell heirs had sought $ 833,000 from Ms. <PERSON> Deforges </PERSON> and her publisher. `` We are exceedingly pleased with the findings of the court as to piracy,'' said <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, a former law partner of Miss <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s late brother, <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, and an executor of the `` Gone With the Wind'' estate. `` We are somewhat disappointed in the award of damages, however,'' he added, saying he plans to appeal. <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>, accepted the news calmly. `` It sounds all right. We seem to have won the case,'' he said. <PERSON> Franck </PERSON> <PERSON> Spengler </PERSON>, president of the company that published Ms. <PERSON> Deforges </PERSON>' book, said he and the author also would appeal. The novelist was in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and unavailable for comment, he said. `` We feel we're innocent,'' <PERSON> Spengler </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` The books are both great novels but they are very different. ... ` The Blue Bicycle' is a historical novel smattered with psychology and emotion while ` Gone With the Wind' is a psychological novel cloaked with history,'' he said. In a judgment issued by Judge <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> <PERSON> Antoine </PERSON>, the court concluded `` The Blue Bicycle'' constituted an `` illicit reproduction'' of `` Gone With the Wind.'' `` Based on a comparative study of the two works, it is clear that what <PERSON> Regine </PERSON> <PERSON> Deforges </PERSON> borrowed from <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s work and incorporated into ` The Blue Bicycle' is perfectly identifiable and relates to the most important elements of Ms. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s novel,'' the statement said `` The Blue Bicycle,'' which has sold millions of copies since it was published in 1983 as the first part of a trilogy, is set during the Nazi occupation of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Its heroine, <PERSON> Lea </PERSON> <PERSON> Delmas </PERSON>, is the beautiful, headstrong daughter of a southern vintner. Like <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON>, the beautiful, headstrong daughter of a southern planter, she finds her carefree youth interrupted by the horrors of war. Like <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lea </PERSON> wants the one man she can not have. <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Argilat </PERSON> has married the sweet, fragile and morally upright <PERSON> Camille </PERSON>, a character similar to <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkes </PERSON>, wife of <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON>'s unrequited love, <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkes </PERSON> Ms. <PERSON> Deforges </PERSON>' French-style <PERSON> Rhett </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> _ <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Tavernier </PERSON> _ is a swarthy, cigar-smoking rogue who miraculously turns up whenever <PERSON> Lea </PERSON> needs him. The case has been long and complicated because there are few precedents. French law forbids plagiarism, but it does allow pastiche, a centuries-old literary form defined as a `` humorous'' take-off or remake of a recognizable original text. Ms. <PERSON> Deforges </PERSON> repeatedly asserted that her novel was meant as a pastiche, but the court rejected her argument, saying the differences between the two works were `` undeniably secondary and inoperative given the extent of their similarities.''

 Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is trying to quash a subpoena for his notes and diaries by onetime national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, saying it encroaches on the office of the presidency. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, facing trial Jan. 22, contends that notes and diaries compiled by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will show the ex-president authorized the activities for which <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> has been accused of crimes. In a court filing Wednesday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s subpoena was a `` broad-gauge discovery device masquerading as a trial subpoena'' and that it seeks a `` laundry list'' of documents on 67 different subjects. The subpoena raises constitutional concerns about the president's prerogative to `` maintain a purely personal and private record of his thoughts and reflections,'' said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s lawyers. `` Nothing could be closer to the core of the presidency and more private than the intimate and confidential communications by the president with himself,'' the lawyers argued. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> suggested in separate filings that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> might become involved in the battle over the records from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidency. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> suggested a review of a limited number of diary excerpts by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, who is handling the <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> case. `` Only then should the former president and, if appropriate, the incumbent president be forced to assert or waive executive privilege,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in the court papers. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> urged the court to consider <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s views before taking the `` extremely serious step'' of forcing public disclosure of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s diaries. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> proposed a procedure under which it would review a sealed filing that <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> made to the court outlining `` what he believes are in the diaries and why he needs them.'' The department noted that this procedure would not compromise the secrecy of <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s defense because the office of independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, not the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, is prosecuting the case. After reviewing <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s filing, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it would prepare a response. The court could then inspect excerpts of the diaries, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. The department moved to quash a similar subpoena for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> papers served by <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> on the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The material sought from the <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> has already been turned over to Iran-Contra prosecutors, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s lawyers said any diary entry must be found by the judge to be `` central'' to <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s case and `` essential to justice'' before it can be disclosed. Earlier Wednesday, the judge rejected a request by <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> to subpoena records from 65 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators and representatives. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> also denied as overly broad <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s request to issue subpoenas to a number of congressional committees, the office of <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The judge did not disclose how many committees <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> wanted to subpoena. The judge said the only apparent basis for the proposed subpoenas to the members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is that they `` at one time or other met with <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>.'' North, a former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff member, was involved in the secret Contra resupply network and the administration's arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. He was convicted of three felonies in the Iran-Contra affair and is appealing. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> has said that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` formulated'' or tacitly approved `` the administration's position'' on matters for which <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> now faces trial. He has said his communications with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> included discussion of a White House chronology that falsely said no one in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government knew at the time that a 1985 shipment to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> contained Hawk missiles. Another subject <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> says he discussed with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is the administration's view of a proposed <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> resolution of inquiry into <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s secret Contra resupply network. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> is accused of obstructing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by endorsing earlier denials that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff was soliciting funds or coordinating military efforts for the Contras.

 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said today it launched a rocket capable of carrying satellites into space, a development that would have profound implications for the military balance in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamel </PERSON>, minister of industry and military industrialization, said on state-run <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> radio that the three-stage rocket was launched at 8:30 a.m. Tuesday from the <LOCATION> Al-Anbar </LOCATION> space research center. He also claimed that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has developed two other surface-to-surface missiles with a range of 1,240 miles. If true, this would double the reach of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s missile arsenal. The heaviest missile the Iraqis are believed to have developed is the al-Hussain weapon with a range of around 560 miles. There was no independent confirmation of the launch. The report did not specify the missile's flight path or say where the research center is located. <PERSON> Kamel </PERSON> said the 48-ton rocket will be used to launch a satellite for scientific research. He said it used a 70-ton first-stage launch vehicle, far bigger than anything the Iraqis were believed to possess. He said the launch was the first stage of an Iraqi space research program. Oil-rich <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is the only <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> country to have claimed it has the capability of launching satellites into space. If true, this could enable it to develop a military satellite to spy on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s rivals in the region. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is the only <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> country known to have satellite capability. President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has been driving to develop an aerospace industry for some time and has spent billions of dollars on missile development. The most ambitious part of the program was developing a multi-stage ballistic missile with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> based on <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s Condor missile. The radio report quoted <PERSON> Kamel </PERSON> as telling <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> in a telegram announcing the launch that the rocket was built at Iraqi military-industrial research centers. But intelligence officials and diplomats have been skeptical for some time about such claims. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> launched the Ofek-1 satellite Sept. 19, 1988, from a military base south of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. It said Ofek-1 was designed for scientific research, but <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> governments fear it will be used as a spy satellite. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has said it is working on an Ofek-2 satellite. The Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported that the Israelis launched a ballistic missile Sept. 14. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> denied it, but Western intelligence agencies believe the reported firing could have been an abortive effort to launch Ofek-2 into orbit. If the Iraqis have acquired the potential to put a satellite into space, the Iranians and Syrians would be concerned. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> fought an eight-year war that was halted by a cease-fire last year, but peace talks have deadlocked and both sides are rearming. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON>'s archrival in the Arab world and was allied with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> during the war. A spy satellite capability would greatly enhance <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON>'s military might and would erode <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s long-held technological superiority, already threatened by the buildup of long-range, surface-to-surface missiles by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> too is seeking a missile arsenal.

 After two years of protests, strikes and bloodshed, the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising has lost its way, failing to deliver a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state or even negotiations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. At the same time, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s government, which refuses to talk with <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, is increasingly frustrated over its inability to restore calm either through diplomacy or force of arms Divisions on both sides have blocked compromises that could have started negotiations. Unless peace efforts gain momentum, the prospects are for even meaner streets with radical Palestinians gaining influence and calling for the use of guns, not words, to solve the problem. The toll from the `` intefadeh'' _ Arabic for uprising _ is already fearful. By <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> count, 626 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures show 39,000 Arabs wounded and 40,000 jailed, 9,000 of whom were denied a trial. Also, 363 Arab houses have been demolished or sealed, and 60 activists deported. On the other side, 43 Israelis have died and 2,438 civilians and 1,635 soldiers were wounded in more than 60,000 incidents of unrest. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s economy suffered about $ 800 million in lost production and tourism as well as increased military costs, including two months a year of reserve duty for most men. Despite the high cost, <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> have scored gains: They succeeded in defining the territory in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> that they want for an independent state. Except for soldiers, most Israelis rarely venture into these areas now. The underground, pro-PLO Unified National Leadership of the Uprising has also demonstrated unity and determination with once-a-week general strikes and the closure of stores and businesses every afternoon. But the strikes and rock-throwing have become routine, almost mechanical gestures that, despite the ongoing bloodshed, no longer carry the political punch needed to arouse international concern and pressure on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` I believe over the last few months we have lost the initiative, and there has been a vacuum of strategy. We have n't had any renewed strategic plan to put into the intefadeh,'' said <PERSON> Sari </PERSON> <PERSON> Nusseibeh </PERSON>, a leading Palestinian intellectual. <PERSON> Nusseibeh </PERSON>, a philosphy professor considered by Israelis to be a senior pro-PLO activist, said Palestinians should use `` positive energy'' to create a provisional government. He proposed health, education, welfare and other organizations be united into area-wide PLO-run institutions that could serve as the basis for ministries in a future government. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s government launched an initiative to start the peace process with elections in the occupied lands to chose a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation for talks. But the Cabinet is deeply divided and unable to deliver compromises to satisfy Palestinian demands that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> have a public role. Two prominent Israeli intellectuals, journalists <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaari </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zeev </PERSON> <PERSON> Shiff </PERSON>, proposed that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> stage an `` administrative withdrawal'' from occupied lands as an interim step until elections can be arranged. They suggested turning over some government functions to moderate Palestinians who would be likely to win elections if they were held. `` Thus some of the burden of occupation would be removed and friction between the inhabitants and the Israeli army will be reduced,'' they wrote. <PERSON> Ephraim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sneh </PERSON>, a retired general who once headed the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> military government, told a seminar at <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, in seeking to influence international opinion, had failed to persuade average Israelis that it had really wanted peace. <PERSON> Sneh </PERSON> called for Palestinians to shift focus and `` understand in the coming year that their real opportunity is not in gaining the sympathy of the world but the confidence of Israelis.'' `` Israeli society is a traumatized society,'' he said, alluding to the Jews' experience with the Nazi Holocaust and repeated wars with the Arabs. `` It is difficult for the Israelis to believe that after 22 years, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> really abandoned terrorism,'' he said. In recent months, there has been increasing concern about the rise of Palestinian radicals who oppose negotiations and advocate armed struggle. Splits in <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> ranks are already clear with small extremist groups taking over neighborhoods or towns and, according to underground leaflets, operating independently. Inter-Palestinian violence has increased. Palestinians have killed 154 of their fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of informing for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Groups calling themselves the Black Panthers and <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagles </ORGANIZATION> controlled the Casbah quarter of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, killing 25 suspected collaborators and shooting at <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> outposts. The army claimed to have neutralized the two groups, killing or capturing their leaders in recent weeks, but there is ongoing concern such groups will proliferate as frustrations grow over a lack of progress toward peace talks. <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON>, editor of the Arabic daily <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fajr </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said peace prospects appeared bleak but that the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leadership was trying to maintain its no-guns policy. `` Palestinians are trying in every way to keep this a non-violent resistance movement in order to positively affect <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> public opinion,'' he said, calling for increased Israeli-Palestinian dialogue.

<HEAD>AMA Supports AIDS Notification; Attacks Tobacco</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> policymakers have recommended that communities set up systems to find and notify unsuspecting sexual or needle-sharing partners of people infected with the AIDS virus. The <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday also broadened its attack on drug abuse to include tobacco-related diseases. The delegates approved the AIDS notification policy by voice vote as part of a resolution that encourages state legislatures to establish laws for reporting and following up on serious communicable diseases including AIDS. The resolution says communities and prisons should have systems to notify people who are at risk of AIDS because they have sexual partners or share drug needles with infected people. Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> said concern for patient privacy should be secondary in light of the number of AIDS deaths in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. As of the end of October, the federal health authorities had recorded 112,241 cases of AIDS in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with 66,493 deaths. However, former military physician <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> protested, saying devising a system to keep track of sexual or drug-use partners would `` waste incredible amounts of money'' and drive people infected with the AIDS virus underground. In other business, the association resisted an attempt to remove tobacco from a resolution naming substance abuse its top health priority. The resolution included the endorsement of a routine screening program for all pregnant women and those of childbearing age for evidence of substance abuse. Before ending its three-day meeting Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> delegates also ordered the restructuring of the group's internal organization and restricted the authority of its executive vice president. That action came after <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> Executive Vice President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON> approved two financial deals with executives that failed and caused thousands of dollars in losses. <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON> accepted full responsibility for the deals and a call for his immediate resignation failed, with more than two-thirds of the 435 delegates supporting him. <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON> is due to retire at the end of next year. The organization's 280,000 members account for about half the doctors in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Government Cholesterol Program Faulted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government's massive cholesterol education program places too much emphasis on drug treatments that may do more harm than good, a congressional panel was told today. But a federal official defended the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cholesterol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, saying its guidelines will improve the health of Americans and reduce the risk of heart attacks _ the nation's leading killer <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, an investigative reporter whose article in the September issue of The <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> magazine inflamed the controversy over cholesterol monitoring, said he questions the value of what he says is aggressive treatment recommended by the federal program. `` This is a very serious and expensive mistake in public policy,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on health. The program's cholesterol guidelines recommend diet as the treatment of choice, but says that failing that, patients with high levels of cholesterol should seek treatment with drugs. An estimated 60 million Americans are believed to have high blood cholesterol, a fatty substance that can clog arteries and contribute to heart disease and heart attacks. Besides cholesterol, other factors that have been identified as factors in heart disease are high blood pressure, obesity, smoking and lack of exercise. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said he agrees with advice in the program's guidelines that Americans should have their cholesterol levels checked and make their diets healthier by eating less fat, fewer calories and more fiber. He also said there is evidence that high cholesterol levels in middle-aged men makes them more vulnerable to heart disease, although he said the evidence of a link is much weaker for men over 65 and women of all ages who have no history of heart disease. `` But the central question is do we have effective medical treatment that justifies putting 60 million people under long-term care of their doctor,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. He said the evidence he has found shows that diet does little to lower cholesterol levels in the blood, and that while drug treatments show more benefit, they have not demonstrated significant ability to ward off fatal heart attacks. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said his complaint with the cholesterol program of the National Heart, Lung and <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> is that with evidence that diet is n't a significant factor in lowering cholesterol levels, many who follow the program's guidelines will turn to drug treatments that can have side effects including liver damage, cataracts and digestive difficulties. `` When people become frustrated with diet, there will be an expansion of drug treatment beyond what the architects of the program expected,'' he said. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenfant </PERSON>, director of the Heart, Lung and <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, part of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, disputed <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and said clinical trials have shown that lowering cholesterol levels by diet or drugs decreases the incidence of heart disease. `` Most people with high blood cholesterol will be able to lower their levels with diet alone, and only a small minority will have to resort to drugs,'' he said. <PERSON> Lenfant </PERSON> also noted that when the first Surgeon General's Report on Smoking and Health was released in the mid 1960s, critics started talking about the `` tobacco myth.'' `` It has taken a long time for the ripples to subside and for near unanimity to emerge that the risks of smoking are no myth,'' he said. `` Much the same is true for cholesterol. It may take a while before there is universal agreement about cholesterol-lowering, but cholesterol is also no myth.''

<TEXT>
 Communist Premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> resigned today after failing to form a coalition government acceptable to opposition groups, and he was replaced by the deputy premier. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> quit after meeting with leaders of allied non-Communist parties to discuss changes in the government, according to <PERSON> Bohuslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Kucera </PERSON>, head of one of those parties, the Socialists. <PERSON> Kucera </PERSON> said in an interview that <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> wanted a new person to head the next coalition government and to reach the compromises necessary to carry out reforms being sought by the tumultuous pro-democracy movement. Several hours later, President <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> asked Deputy Premier <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Calfa </PERSON> to replace <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>, the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Calfa </PERSON>, who was promoted to the deputy premiership from minister without portfolio on Sunday, participated in most of <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>'s talks with the opposition on forming a new government to resolve <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s political crisis. <PERSON> Calfa </PERSON>, 43, studied at <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Charles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faculty </ORGANIZATION>. He had served as minister without portfolio since April 1988. It was not immediately known how his promotion would affect the talks with the opposition. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> had negotiated with opposition leaders in recent weeks and on Sunday introduced a new 21-member Cabinet that included only five non-Communists and left Communists in control of key ministries. The opposition demanded more power for non-Communists and another new government by Dec. 10. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> threatened Wednesday to resign if the opposition did not stop delivering him `` ultimatums.'' His resignation leaves the 21-member Cabinet, which was the subject of huge street protests, in charge of the nation. Earlier today, the opposition submitted <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> with a list of seven names for consideration in a new government. The Civic Forum opposition movement, and its Slovak counterpart, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Violence </ORGANIZATION>, have threatened a nationwide general strike Dec. 11 if non-Communists are not given more power. A general strike Nov. 27 was observed by millions and led to <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>'s promise to create a new government with non-Communists. The seven names given <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> were not released, but opposition sources said leading Slovak dissident <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnogursky </PERSON> was on the list. <PERSON> Carnogursky </PERSON> was released from prison just 12 days ago after being held since August. The struggle over the composition of the government comes after several weeks of whirlwind political changes. In the weeks since a harsh police crackdown Nov. 17 on a peaceful demonstration in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, the energized pro-democracy movement has forced the Communists to relinquish their 41-year monopoly on power and to reverse 21 years of hard-line policy on the failed <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Spring reforms of 1968. Hard-line leaders tied to the crackdown after 1968 have been sacked, except <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>, whose resignation the opposition has demanded. The opposition today denied it had intentionally put <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> under pressure to change the Cabinet. `` The crisis was caused by the current government, not by us,'' the opposition said in a statement. `` We are not trying to force our demands through, and we are not trying to force anybody to accept them in a hurry or under pressure.'' In addition to <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> and several other members of the ruling Politburo were at today's meeting The shape of the new Cabinet was expected to hinge on the outcome of the negotiations and on resolution of internal debates within the opposition and other groups. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> said in his Wednesday television address that it was difficult to get professionals the opposition wants in the government to join such a Cabinet. The public mood `` changes from day to day and hour to hour,'' he said. He said he would have no choice but to quit if the new Cabinet failed towin public confidence and the leadership crisis were not resolved. The announcement was an obvious appeal to citizens to trust him to lead reforms that have ended the Communists' guaranteed monopoly on power in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised savings and loan regulator <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> in a letter released Thursday, but a prominent Republican senator criticized the administration for not defending <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> who announced his resignation Monday under fire. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> saluted Wall for `` unselfish recognition'' that he could best help the industry by quitting, Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, the senior <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, accused the administration of `` not having any guts'' and failing to support the regulator. Wall was a focus of six weeks of hearings by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which was investigating his handling of the failure of <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> is expected to be the nation's biggest thrift failure at a cost to taxpayers of $ 2 billion `` I am disappointed'' in the administration's dealing with Wall, <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> said in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Deseret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. `` If it had been their nominee, their appointment, they would'' have supported Wall, who earlier served 12 years as the senator's top aide, he said. <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> said, `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> was a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appointee and they certainly in no way came to his defense.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a `` Dear Danny'' letter dated Wednesday, commended Wall for hard work as director of the Office of Thrift Supervision and for his `` unselfish recognition that the job of revitalizing the industry demands the complete and undistracted attention of the agency's entire leadership and staff.'' Calls for Wall's resignation had come from <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>; Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>; several major newspapers and citizens groups.

Wall took over as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in July 1987. In August of this year, he became director of the thrift office when the bank board was dismantled under <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L bailout legislation. He told a news conference he was resigning because continuing the fight with the committee would distract the agency from conducting its work. He is continuing to serve as thrift office director for an unspecified transitional period.

 Leftist guerrillas renewed their assault on the Salvadoran capital today, setting up positions in at least seven neighborhoods and battling government soldiers. The rebels claimed they shot down a military helicopter, but the government said it suffered a mechanical problem and crashed. A statement by the armed forces press office said columns of rebels infiltrated the metropolitan area from the north, east and west during the night, including the upper-class <PERSON> Escalon </PERSON> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Benito </LOCATION> districts. There were no immediate reports of casualties, a military spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity for security reasons. Planes and helicopter gunships flew over the city during the night, dropping flares and strafing suspected rebel positions, while troops on the ground opened up with automatic weapons fire. But the new outbreak was much smaller than the fighting that began when guerrillas launched an urban offensive on Nov. 11 as part of their decade-old struggle for power against a succession of U.S.-backed governments. Fighting had subsided to a few scarce shots since Friday after the rebels withdrew from an incursion in <LOCATION> Escalon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Benito </LOCATION>. Also reported under attack were the working-class neighborhoods of Aytuxtepeque, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ramon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soyapango </LOCATION>, north and east of the city, and the small town of <LOCATION> Apopa </LOCATION>, to the north, the military said. The military spokesman said a U.S.-made helicopter crashed during the night because `` of mechanical failure,'' but the rebels' clandestine <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venceremos </ORGANIZATION> claimed it was shot down by guerrilla fire In the broadcast, the guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> also announced they were renewing their sabotage campaign against electric power installations and other economic targets. Rebel groups destroyed two city buses, and five private automobiles were destroyed by guerrillas in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION>, 25 miles west of the capital, and a burlap bag factory in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION>, 85 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The rebels also were reported to have dynamited a bridge on the Litoral Highway near the city of <LOCATION> Usulutan </LOCATION>, 70 miles east of the capital. In an unrelated development, the government allowed three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Episcopalian bishops to enter the country to check on several Episcopalians who were imprisoned during the recent offensive by leftist guerrillas. Bishops <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Frey </PERSON> of the diocese of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Swing </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> arrived Wednesday on a commercial flight from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and went through immigration proceedings with no problems. The first two had come on Tuesday and were told by immigration authorities their visas were invalid. They were put on a flight back to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, where they spent the night before making the second attempt to enter. <PERSON> Frey </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> sent a letter by telefax apologizing for the previous day's problems.

 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members involved in prostitution will be expelled from the party, according to new regulations announced Thursday. The party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Discipline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> said any party member who sells sexual favors, patronizes a prostitute or forces or instigates others to do so will lose his or her party membership. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the rules also stipulate that any member who harbors a prostitute, shields related actions or obstructs the investigation or punishment of a prostitution case will receive punishment more severe than removal from party posts. Prostitution is one of the `` six evils'' that have become the target of a nationwide anti-crime campaign. The others are gambling, drugs, the selling of women and children, pornography and superstition. The `` evils'' have been linked to the Western tendencies the current hard-line leadership has sought to eradicate since suppressing the pro-democracy movement in the spring. Prostitution is believed to be most prevalent in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> and other free-wheeling southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> cities and in other cities such as <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, where contacts with foreigners are on the increase.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> said Thursday the Cold War will continue as long as a `` few countries'' _ apparently the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ continue to try to influence events in other countries. `` The practice of power politics will eventually jeopardize the relaxation of the international situation and only lead to a continued Cold War,'' <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jin </PERSON> <PERSON> Guihua </PERSON> said at a weekly news briefing. <PERSON> Jin </PERSON> was responding to a question on whether the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> summit between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signaled an end to the Cold War. `` The international situation is undergoing major changes at present,'' <PERSON> Jin </PERSON> said. `` Hegemonism is finding its going tougher and tougher. However, power politics has n't entirely resigned itself from the historical arena.'' He added: `` In the international relations its still easy to see attempts made to interfere in other's internal affairs by means of one sort or another, violating the norms governing international relations.'' The Chinese government's only previous comment on the summit was that it hoped the results `` will genuinely help relax and stabilize the world situation and will not harm the interests of any third party.'' Asked which superpower was more responsible for prolonging the Cold War, <PERSON> Jin </PERSON> said only: `` In this world of today there are very few countries that are in a position to practice power politics. We are against whomever practices power politics.'' Through much of the 1970s and 1980s <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> claimed that Soviet `` hegemonism'' was the biggest threat to world peace. However, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> this year normalized relations after three decades of animosity, while <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s relations with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> have plummeted following the military crackdown of the pro-democracy movement this spring. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> repeatedly has accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of `` power politics'' for imposing economic sanctions on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to protest the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government's harsh suppression of dissent. <PERSON> Jin </PERSON> on Thursday again blasted the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for taking measures to make it easier for Chinese students worried about persecution at home to extend their stays in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The sending of Chinese personnel to study abroad, their management, and assignment upon their return are all <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s internal affairs in which no foreign government or parliament has the right to interfere,'' <PERSON> Jin </PERSON> said The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action `` is bound to do serious damage to the Sino-U.S. educational exchanges and the responsibility for it lies with the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. side.'' <PERSON> Jin </PERSON> said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had `` taken note'' of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto of a congressional bill on the visa status of Chinese students, but expressed regret that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had taken administrative actions similar to those called for in the bill and said allegations that <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> students face persecution upon their return are `` utterly groundless.''

 Flags flew at half-staff and legislators observed a minute of silence today after a man who said feminists `` spoiled my life'' stormed into the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> engineering school and shot 14 women to death. The man, identified only as `` <PERSON> Marc </PERSON>,'' turned the gun on himself after the worst massacre in Canadian history. Nine women and four men were injured, and two were in critical condition. Most of the victims were female engineering students. The killer, clutching a semi-automatic rifle and wearing ammunition belts across his chest, stalked five floors of the six-story building Wednesday evening and at one point ordered all the men out of a crowded classroom, police said. `` You're all a bunch of feminists,'' he screamed before opening fire on the young women who remained. The <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> police department's public relations officer arrived on the scene and found the body of his daughter, a student, among the dead. `` I heard the gunman say: ` I want the women,''' said student <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Bordeleau </PERSON>. `` It was a human hunt.'' Police said the man left a three-page letter in which he blamed women for his failures and said he was going to kill some in revenge. It was signed only `` <PERSON> Marc </PERSON>,'' and was found on the gunman's body Police would not give the exact wording of the statement or release a copy to reporters but they displayed the gunman's weapon _ a .223 - caliber semi-automatic rifle with bloody fingerprints on the Police director <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Tessier </PERSON> told a news conference today that the letter contained a passing reference to Canadian Forces Cpl. <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Lortie </PERSON>, who killed three people May 8, 1984, with a submachine gun in the Quebec legislature. He said the letter was dated Wednesday. Police investigator <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Duscheneau </PERSON> said the gunman identified himself as a student but did not specify a school. He said 35 to 37 shots were fired. Authorities also said the man carried a buck knife. `` All of <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> is in mourning,'' Quebec Premier <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON> told the provincial legislature today before it observed a minute of silence. <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON> declared a three-day period of official mourning during which flags on all government buildings will fly at half-staff. <PERSON> Monique </PERSON> <PERSON> Gagnon-Tremblay </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> minister who was responsible for the status of women until October, called the killings an isolated incident carried out by somebody who was `` obviously disturbed.'' Asked about possible new gun-control measures, Ms. <PERSON> Gagnon-Tremblay </PERSON>, now immigration minister, said: `` Measures might be good, but I do n't think you can avoid the kind of thing that was done yesterday.'' The rifle used in the shooting is illegal in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Police and witnesses said the gunman, believed to be in his 20s, entered the school about 4:30 p.m. EST as the building was crowded with students on the last day of classes before exams. He walked into the first-floor cafeteria and fatally shot three women, <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> said. He then went to the second floor and at about 5:20 p.m. walked into a classroom containing 60 students, ordering the men into one corner and the women into another, police said. He told the men to leave, then screamed in French before opening fire on the women: `` You're all a bunch of feminists,'' <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> said. Six women died in the classroom. `` It was just like <PERSON> Rambo </PERSON>. He had at least two ammunition belts across his chest,'' said engineering student <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Leclerc </PERSON>, who was in the classroom. <PERSON> Leclerc </PERSON>, 23, said about 15 women remained in the classroom while the men stood in the corridor outside. `` He told them, ` You're women, you're going to be engineers. You're all a bunch of feminists. I hate feminists!,''' <PERSON> Leclerc </PERSON> said. `` My friend <PERSON> Nathalie </PERSON> said, ` No, it's not true. We're not feminists.' He fired into the group.'' `` He came in quietly,'' said student <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavarie </PERSON>. `` And he told us to stop what we were doing. Everyone thought it was a joke. `` He was smiling at us. He was very calm.'' `` Then he fired a shot, right by my ear.'' A woman in an administration office was killed on the same floor. The gunman then climbed to the third floor, where he killed four more women in the corridor, police said. He continued up to the fourth and fifth floors, shooting and wounding men and women. Police say he then returned to the third floor and turned the gun on himself. As word spread of the rampage, distraught, tearful parents came to the university seeking their children. The university, which sits on a hill overlooks the city, is the largest in French-speaking <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, with about 50,000 students. <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Leclair </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> police's head of public relations, arrived and found his daughter, <PERSON> Maryse </PERSON>, dead on the floor, according to university spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Doin </PERSON>. A temporary morgue was set up inside. `` Who could have thought that something like this could happen in a peaceful student world?'' said <PERSON> Ba </PERSON> <PERSON> Madou </PERSON>, 35, an engineering student.

Even though she was from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, she played <PERSON> Aunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Bee </PERSON> so perfectly that everyone believed she was <PERSON> Aunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Bee </PERSON> and from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. `` We who knew her and worked with her will always remember her. We say goodbye with a great deal of sadness,'' said <PERSON> Linke </PERSON>. Actor-singer <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabors </PERSON>, when notified of her death at his <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> home, recalled that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavier </PERSON> `` was very, very good to me when I first started out and I was totally inexperienced in the business.'' `` She was always one of my favorite people,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Nabors </ORGANIZATION>, who played gas station attendant <PERSON> Gomer </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyle </PERSON> in the series. `` I am a better person for having known her.'' He said she taught him a lot about `` personal kindness,'' adding: `` During my free time she taught me about antique shopping.'' Miss <PERSON> Bavier </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> native who would have turned 87 this month, attended <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and was a graduate of the American Academy of the Arts. She had more than 20 years of stage experience, including stints in vaudeville and on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>, where she appeared in such productions as `` Kiss and Tell,'' `` Point of No Return'' and `` The Lady Says No.'' She became famous for her role in the popular show starring <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> as a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> sheriff.

Although she was born in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and lived in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> during her acting days, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavier </PERSON>, as Aunt Bee, often spoke of `` going shopping in <LOCATION> Siler </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, likening the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> war against drugs to people's quest for freedom in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, today lauded a poor <PERSON> black </PERSON> community that united to drive drug dealers out of a public park. `` As with the new freedom in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, freedom from drugs is n't something the government can give you,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in remarks prepared for an anti-drug rally at <LOCATION> Winzer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in his adopted hometown. `` You've got to take a stand.

He said that like those demanding freedom to travel and vote in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the Acres Homes residents `` have used ` people power' to fight for another kind of freedom: freedom from fear; freedom from crime; freedom from drugs.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Acres Home was once `` the embodiment of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream,'' the largest unincorporated black community in the South. `` But in recent years, the dream on Main Street has become the nightmare on Elm Street, a twisted, backwards world where our children and our playgrounds are taken away by an evil menace called cocaine, often in broad daylight,'' he said. By 1987, 25 to 30 drug dealers were operating in <LOCATION> Winzer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, and a circular drive was so clogged with cars of drug-buyers `` that police called it ` crack-in-the-box,''' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. But since 1,000 community activists joined with police to drive the dealers out on April 9, 1988, `` they have n't come back. And they better not.'' He said the local residents had taken a stand against `` evil.'' `` Efforts like yours are a critical part of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s battleplan'' against drugs, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who unveiled his $ 8 billion strategy three months ago He said parents, teachers and other community leaders must teach children right from wrong and instill a sense of personal accountability. `` Only you can cultivate character and a sense of value in our kids. It is not a federal problem for which there is a simple federal solution,'' he said. `` We ca n't do it by looking to the government alone.'' He named the Acres Home War On Drugs group as a recipient of one of his Presidential Points of Light _ a daily honor highlighting outstanding volunteers. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was attending a fund-raiser dinner in the Astrodome tonight for Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, before journeying to <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> on Friday. He will spend the night in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, his adoptive home, before heading to <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> for another anti-drug rally and a campaign luncheon for Rep. <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, R-Colo., a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s national drug policy coordinator, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, also visited <PERSON> Winzer </PERSON> <PERSON> Park </PERSON> recently. On Friday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will take part in an anti-drug rally with members of the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broncos </ORGANIZATION> football team, then fly to <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION> to address a fund-raising dinner for Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON> plans to run for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat of Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s trip on behalf of domestic anti-drug efforts comes a day after more violence rocked the drug-producing nation of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. A truck bomb exploded outside police headquarters in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, killing dozens and wounding hundreds during morning rush hour. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> is still being considered as a site for the February drug summit that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will attend with the leaders of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, the chief drug-producing nations. However, he said, other sites outside of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> are also being considered. `` Wherever we hold it, we will do so with the assurance that we can provide security for the president,'' he told reporters. Speaking about another Latin American trouble spot, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the Nicaraguan Contra rebels had `` no alternative'' but to stay intact as a fighting force despite a regional peace accord requiring them to disband Dec. 5. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> contended that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government has not lived up to its commitments under the August agreement to promote democratic reforms and encourage repatriation of the Contras.

 The world's population is expected to grow by about a billion people in each of the next three decades but wo n't be increasing as rapidly as it has been, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday Currently at 5.2 billion people, the world's population is expected to grow to 6.3 billion by the year 2000, 7.3 billion by 2010 and 8.3 billion by 2020. More than nine out of 10 new arrivals will be in developing countries, the bureau said. Even with the addition of a billion people every 10 years the planet's overall growth rate will fall to lower levels than at present, the agency said. Worldwide population growth was 1.7 percent in the 1980s and is expected to be 1.8 percent in the 1990s, then to fall to 1.4 percent between 2000 and 2010 and to 1.3 percent from 2010 to 2020.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is voicing deep skepticism about <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s efforts to repair the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s ailing economy, saying his ideas are simplistic and `` just far from the real world.'' The gloomy assessment arises from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s weekend talks with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during a two-day summit off the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. A senior administration official, intimately acquainted with the two leaders' discussions, said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> demonstrated he has `` less than a realistic economic notion of how to deal with his economic problems.'' Referring to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s ideas, the official said, `` They're simplistic. The official discussed the summit with a small group of reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> under assurances of remaining anonymous. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, speaking with reporters today aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, said, `` We would n't use that word.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that the Soviets do have `` a lack of knowledge about how free enterprise systems work and how market economies work. And that was reflected in the conversation'' between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. He said `` simplistic'' was `` not a very good word to use. But there is going to be a problem in introducing free market economies to these -LRB- Marxist -RRB- countries.'' The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is suffering from widespread shortages of food, fuel and consumer goods despite <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program of economic reform, known as perestroika. The problems are expected to worsen during the bitter Soviet winter, raising fears of civil unrest. `` A lot of his economic definitions and ideas and so on come out of a kind of Marxist mold and they're just far from the real world,'' the official said. In particular, the official mentioned <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s views on converting the ruble to a hard currency, his lack of information about the benefits of a central bank comparable to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and his ideas about long-term leasing of land and factories to Soviet farmers and workers. `` The other side of it was, here is a man of great self-confidence,'' the official said. `` There was no hint of self-doubt given the immensity of the problems he faces, which he acknowledges, but -LRB- he was -RRB- very, very self-assured.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> held eight hours of talks in their first superpower summit. The official said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was `` more self-controlled'' than in his five earlier summit meetings with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` Clearly he wanted to establish a relationship with the president, and wanted this to be good,'' the official said. During the summit, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> offered an array of economic concessions to help <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> deal with his economic problems. The president proposed completion of a U.S.-Soviet trade agreement by June 1990, granting `` most favored nation'' status to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, giving it the lowest possible tariffs for its exports. The most favored nation status would be linked with the waiver of a 1974 law that imposed trade sanctions against <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in retaliation for restrictions on emigration by Soviet Jews. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also proposed giving <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> observer status at a world organization that sets international trading rules, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Until now, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had strongly opposed Soviet participation. `` I think he needs a lot more sophistiction,'' the official said about <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` One of the things that will help him get the sophistication is something like observer status at <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, so he can have a look at how the world economy really works. `` I'm not sure where he wants to go with economic reforms,'' the official added. While welcoming <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s economic package, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` was not at all in a posture of saying, ` We want your help,''' the official said. `` What they do n't want is the notion that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is going to come in to bail them out. We're not going to do it, anyway.'' On another subject, the official said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> suggested some flexibility toward ethnic unrest in the Baltic states. The official said the Soviet leader said he was prepared `` to look on all kinds of autonomy,'' but that he would `` draw the line at independence.'' The official quoted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as saying, `` ` We need to look for new structures to meet new circumstances.''' The official added, `` He seemed quite open to experimentation.''

<TEXT>
 A banner on the outskirts says, `` With Soviet Union Forever,'' but the people of this <LOCATION> Bohemian </LOCATION> village want to sell their 20-foot statue of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> for Western currency. `` Everyone in town is with the revolution against the Communists except one guy, and he's in the secret police,'' said butcher <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Jicha </PERSON>. `` Well, maybe 10 percent of <PERSON> Komarov </PERSON> opposes these changes, but all of the rest are happy,'' said elementary school teacher, <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Beran </PERSON>. Whatever the numbers, a glance outside <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> shows that the students' November revolution is firmly implanted in smaller cities and rural areas. In <LOCATION> Plzen </LOCATION>, an industrial city 50 miles west of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, anti-Communist posters are less evident than in the capital. But attitudes are clear. During last week's strike, even the fabled Urquell Pilsener beer stopped flowing. `` No one hesitated when we asked them to stop,'' said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kylbergr </PERSON>, strike organizer at Prazdroj Brewery. Workers left even before he got a chance to read his manifesto. `` We wo n't have to disband Communist groups here,'' added <PERSON> Kylbergr </PERSON>, 27. `` They'll destroy themselves.'' If any place in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> exemplifies the new mood, it is <PERSON> Komarov </PERSON>, a village of 2,200 people about 30 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Komarov </PERSON> makes machine parts _ no one likes to be more specific _ and the factory put up an immense stone statue of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> in the 1950s. It's still there on the square, one of the last Stalin monuments left in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Reformers were about to smash it into gravel when a visiting professor mentioned someone in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> collected <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> memorabilia. <PERSON> Komarov </PERSON> townsfolk, in need of an old-age home, figured <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> might be of some use to them after all. That was a few days ago. The plan, in its earliest stages, has not yet reached the proper channels for approval. At first glance, <PERSON> Komarov </PERSON> looks like a party town. Walls are festooned with red stars, the odd hammer and sickle, and standard-issue Marxist-Leninist poster art. A bulletin board announced a party youth march. And there was <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s statue, identifying him as, `` The Greater Teacher of Working People, Liberator of our Country.'' Asked about it, <PERSON> Beran </PERSON> advised: `` Do n't pay any attention to that garbage. Look over there.'' He pointed to glass double doors to the little shopping mall, plastered with leaflets from the opposition Civic Forum. Inside, in a well-stocked store offering everything from bidets to bicycles, saleswoman <PERSON> Iva </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartipanova </PERSON> explained how the pamphlets got there. `` We did n't know anything about what was happening in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> until these things appeared on the doors,'' she said. `` During the night, someone ripped them off. But then they appeared again.'' When demonstrations began in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, volunteer taxi drivers took students and actors from town to town to spread the word. They found willing ears in <PERSON> Komarov </PERSON>. `` Anyone who lived through the 1968 invasion must support what the Civic Forum is doing,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bartipanova </PERSON> said. In 1968, she was just bringing her infant son home from the hospital when she ran into Soviet troops headquartered just up the road. Down a country road from <PERSON> Komarov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Prochazka </PERSON>, 65, lives alone on isolated farm the state decided to return to him last year after keeping it for four decades. He knows all about the uprising. <PERSON> Prochazka </PERSON> could hardly believe it. Back in the 1950s, he watched the Communist militia shoot two men who mocked the idea of collective farms. He spent years in a forced labor camp because his father would not join a collective. He suffered later when a nephew defected. Now he makes a meager living sawing logs in the farm's small mill, which the state still owns. Despite it all, he has swung right back into political kibitzing, in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s democratic tradition. `` The opposition is doing the wrong thing,'' he said. `` We need two strong parties, the <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the Socialists.'' In sharp contrast to the immediate past, almost everyone was happy to talk. Mothers pushing babies in prams carefully spelled out their names. Young soldiers described their enthusiasm, and their officers' misgivings. For <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Sojka </PERSON>, a 85-year-old pensioner in a moth-eaten fur hat, the biggest surprise of the revolution was seeing an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> reporter and English photographer wandering around loose. <PERSON> Sojka </PERSON> would just as soon keep the <LOCATION> Stalin </LOCATION> statue _ it is art, he says, _ but he wants to see it accompanied by a monument to <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s first president.

 The battleship USS Iowa, its No. 2 turret still sealed after an April explosion that killed 47 sailors, arrived today to cheers from the crew's family and friends after a six-month deployment in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. The crew lined the rail, bundled in pea coats to protect against cold, blustery winds, as the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> docked at its home port shortly after 1 p.m.. A cheer went up from more than 1,000 family members and friends when the ship appeared on the horizon, then they waited patiently for it to dock <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials kept reporters about 500 yards away from the crowd. During normal homecomings, the crew, families and media representatives are free to mix after the ship ties up. `` We're doing this to protect the privacy of the crewmen and their families,'' said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. Adm. <PERSON> J.D </PERSON>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, the 6th Fleet commander in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, laid the groundwork for a festive welcome by telling crew families in a letter, `` Pull out all the stops for the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s homecoming. In contrast, the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s return to <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> four days after the April 19 gun turret explosion was somber and silent. Then, the 1,500 crewmen in their white uniforms lined the battleship's rails. Each crewman wore a black armband. As tugs nudged the 887-foot warship was nudged toward the pier, the several thousand people on shore stood silent. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s controversial report on the explosion was released in September while the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> was at sea. It found the blast most likely was caused by a disgruntled gunner's mate who sabotaged the huge gun and died in the explosion. That report is being challenged by many of the families of the 47 victims who believe the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is covering up equipment and training failures aboard the World War II-era battleship. Congressional committees will hear testimony next week from <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> experts. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigators found that sabotage was the only explanation for the explosion, but the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has declined to endorse that conclusion because its tests and investigation failed to duplicate the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s findings.

 Congressional leaders expressed concern today about the depth of opposition to Philippine President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, despite her apparent success in quelling the latest coup against her government. `` It appears that the immediate threat to Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government has been removed, but it's troubling that some of the rebel military elements -LRB- are -RRB- among the most professional and proficient Philippine military,'' House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> told reporters outside the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> after a meeting with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., said the coup raises concerns about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, especially as the two nations enter negotiations for the future of the major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases there `` We're obviously concerned about what that money's going to be spent on, what the government's going to be there,'' said <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, R-Wyo., said this was the best organized coup to date `` Our intelligence shows us if they keep stepping it up grade by grade, she will be in deep trouble,'' he said. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> noted that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been considering aid of up to $ 1.6 billion, including benefits for Philippine war veterans, as part of the price of renewing base leases. A senior adminstration official said Wedneday that despite putting down the coup, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s political future appears uncertain. `` She's been hurt, there's no question about it,'' said the official, adding that Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> should `` take seriously what happened.'' Asked about those comments today, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` On the record, we would not speculate on'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s future. He acknowledged that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has concerns about the situation and certain Philippine policies, `` but that does not diminish the fact that we support her and her government and we hope that they're successful.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said `` Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government has shown incredible resilience in this situation,'' and he restated `` our very strong support for her.'' Setting a more optimistic tone than the senior official, <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said pessimism surrounded a coup attempt in 1987, but that the <ORGANIZATION> Phillipines </ORGANIZATION> rebounded rapidly and continued its economic growth. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> now expects `` that the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> people can pull together under President <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s leadership'' to achieve a similar recovery from the latest unrest, he said. The official, briefing a small group of reporters Wednesday on the condition that he not be identified further, apparently was seeking to send a clear message to Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s U.S.-backed government to become more responsive to criticism within her country. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s future may depend on her ability to `` eliminate the sources of discontent,'' the official said. Uneasiness among the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> population in general, and within the military in particular, is a sure sign of trouble `` and as a political leader she has to deal with it,'' the official said. Asked if Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> could survive politically, the official said: `` That's a tough one.'' He spoke as the coup attempt _ the sixth since she took office in 1986 _ seemed to be running out of steam. Rebel forces who had fortified themselves in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION> business district returned voluntarily to their barracks Thursday. However, it remained unclear whether the announcement marked the end of the coup. At least 79 people have been killed and more than 570 wounded since Friday. Earlier, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials praised as `` careful and effective'' a <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> evacuation that freed 280 Americans and other foreign citizens from the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> hotels where they had been trapped by gunfire in the 7-day-old rebellion. `` We commend the Aquino government for organizing and carrying out this operation,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>, applauding the `` careful and effective manner in which it dealt with the situation in the <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION> commercial district and the efforts it took to safeguard <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens and others who were in the area.'' The senior administration official said that, with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military help, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> had appeared to survive `` an almost-successful coup,'' correcting himself to say `` a serious attempted coup.'' In any event, he said, `` I think that if she takes seriously what happened and tries to eliminate the sources of discontent which helped lead to the coup, it may come out'' all right for her. `` We really have to reassess what all this means.'' Asked to elaborate, he said: `` We have to assess what this has done and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> assistance in terms of the situation. People will use the fact that she called on <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> against her.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> heeded Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s plea for help last Friday, sending F-4 fighter jets from <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> screaming over two air fields held by rebels, preventing the insurgents from using those fields to launch additional attacks. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> gave $ 650 million to the Aquino government this year, the third largest foreign aid package, behind only <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains two bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and the sprawling <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> naval base. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leases on both bases expire in 1991, and the attempted coup seriously complicates efforts to renegotiate those leases. For the time being, lease talks have been put on hold.

 Entertainer <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> has asked a federal appeals court to uphold the record $ 5.3 million damage award in his suit against <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> over reports that he was linked to organized crime figures. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>'s attorney has filed a 120-page brief with the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, saying that overturning the award would have `` dire consequences to the public.'' Lawyer <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Galane </PERSON> said in the brief filed Nov. 17 that if the verdict is overturned, `` victims of malicious defamation by the mass media will have no effective remedy and the media will not be deterred from disseminating knowing or reckless falsehoods. `` The cost of litigating against a media giant like <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> will often exceed any compensatory award the victim could hope to receive.'' If upheld, <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>'s award would be the largest on record arising from a news report. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> sued the network in 1981, claiming that a series of broadcasts in 1980 defamed him.

The `` forum of four'' includes <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc and well as two left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members, Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>. The moves came as the Israeli army clamped an indefinite curfew on 750,000 Palestinians in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and was expected to limit movement by about 1 million people in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> to block protests linked to Friday's anniversary. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, reinforced army units patrolled <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, and police increased patrols in Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, soldiers announced through loudspeakers that the seaside strip was under curfew. PLO-backed uprising leaders ordered a three-day work stoppage starting Thursday throughout the occupied lands to mark the anniversary of the `` intefadeh'' _ Arabic for uprising _ in addition to a general strike Saturday. Palestinian protests were subdued by rain Thursday, but police detained three people in a stone-throwing protest near <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and four protesters were reported shot and wounded in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio broadcast a police alert urging citizens to watch out for suspicious objects after two small bombs were found Thursday atop bottled gas canisters in a neighborhood of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Both were defused by police. Police reported that a grenade was thrown at a house in the Jewish quarter of the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> but did not explode. Also in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, the army demolished three houses in the <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> refugee camp overnight, saying the residents were jailed on suspicion of killing alleged pro-Israeli informers and belonging to uprising shock committees. In <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> told a seminar on the uprising that he would like to see `` harsher punishment for parents of stone-throwers ... and much harsher punishment for -LRB- suspects -RRB- with repeated offenses.'' The army says 40,000 Palestinians have been imprisoned since the start of the uprising and 9,142 are currently in jail. At least 626 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli gunfire in the revolt, and 155 other Palestinians were slain by fellow <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> as suspected collaborators. Forty-three Israelis also have been killed. <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> said the army could serve as `` an instrument of the political level'' but could not end the Palestinian rebellion by itself. `` There is no military solution to the uprising -LRB- but -RRB- ... we can prevent the violence of the uprising from dictating political moves,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> gave the prime minister's response to the proposed meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials announced <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> had agreed to the meeting. `` If the Americans believe it is a full response and want to see where we go from here, we'll go in January to the meeting of the three foreign ministers,'' <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> said in an interview. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> urged the three-way meeting to pave the way for Israeli-Palestinian talks in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s initiative for elections in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> said that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> still had not seen the full text of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s reply and hoped the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> meeting could answer questions about <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s stance. `` It will be important to determine what <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s intentions are, and the ability to advance the peace initiative as <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has proposed, to hold elections,'' he said. Under <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s plan, adopted in May, Palestinians would be elected to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on a period of interim self-rule for the occupied lands. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> has criticized the proposal since it is designed to bypass the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and fails to guarantee eventual Palestinian independence, the main aim of the uprising. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> views the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as a terrorist organization and accepted the <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> plan on condition the group would be excluded from the peace process. Israeli officials said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> worked out a `` positive stand'' to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s plan after receiving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assurances that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s reply was its own and not that of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> made it clear to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> that it could not accept that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> would act as a postman for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> made it very clear that it is not acting as such and would not do so,'' a senior Israeli diplomat said. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s coalition partners in the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> party praised <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s reply, and Vice Premier and Labor leader <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> declared: `` If it's positive, it's enough.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> suffered a major defeat in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Thursday when the republic of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> abolished the constitutional guarantee of Communist supremacy and legalized a multiparty system. Similar action has been taken in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> as part of the wave of political upheaval and reform that is diminishing the role of the Communist Part in those nations. <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s parliament defied <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with a resounding 243-1 vote to end the party's total dominance of all political and social organizations within the Baltic republic. Another 98 deputies abstained or stayed away from the session. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has resolutely opposed a multiparty system for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The challenge to the Communist power structure comes at a time when he faces a crippled economy, growing nationalism and demands from conservative communists for more order. The move in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, one of 15 Soviet republics, thrilled other <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> activists who are organizing a two-hour general strike Monday to call for similar action by the national parliament. `` Wonderfully done!'' said activist <PERSON> Yelena </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> on hearing of the Lithuanian action. `` You can not restrain the movement today. This is a good example for the other republics,'' said <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>, wife of Nobel Peace Prize winner <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, one of a group of national parliamentarians calling for the general strike. <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s parliament voted Wednesday to delay voting on a similar switch to a multiparty system until next week, to allow time for public discussion. <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s parliament was forced into a postponement Wednesday for lack of a quorum. The Lithuanian action rescinds Article 6 of the republic's constitution, which says the Communist Party of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is the `` leading and guiding force of Soviet society, the nucleus of its political system, government and social organizations,'' according to <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> In practice, it meant that Communists dominated every sphere of life and every organization in the country. Until <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms began to loosen the iron custom, ambitious Soviets were forced to join the party and follow its orders to rise in any profession Similar articles are found in the national constitution of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and those of the other 14 republics. Word of the call for a general strike to demand a parliamentary vote on the national version of Article 6 began to percolate through Soviet society Thursday, after it was reported by Western radio stations. On Thursday, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> published the first mention of the strike call in a generally circulated Soviet publication. The article was highly critical of the strike call but nevertheless spread the word to the newspaper's 9.5 million readers nationwide. It accompanied a letter from parliamentarian <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Chernichenko </PERSON> saying he supported the call for a vote on the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s supremacy, but not the plan for a strike <PERSON> Chernichenko </PERSON>'s name was among the supporters listed on announcements of the strike. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and his fellow deputies called the strike to pressure the national <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies into voting to rescind Article 6 and on draft laws on land, property and business enterprises. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> starts its second semi-annual session Tuesday. In <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to meet with factory and labor leaders to respond to the call for a general strike. <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> <PERSON> Krumins </PERSON>, deputy editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Latvian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Atmoda </ORGANIZATION>, said the Latvians are likely to strongly support the strike, but for just 15 minutes, not two hours. <PERSON> Eduardas </PERSON> <PERSON> Potashinskas </PERSON>, an activist who watched a live TV feed of the parliamentary session in the capital of <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>, said the Supreme Soviet directed that a new law governing the actions of political parties in the republic be prepared in the next 45 days. <PERSON> Potashinkas </PERSON> said Lithuanian Party First Secretary <PERSON> Algirdas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brazauskas </PERSON> and other party leaders voted for the change. He said that in debate Tuesday, <PERSON> Brazauskas </PERSON> had termed the decision `` difficult, but correct.'' A first try Tuesday fell nine votes short of the two-thirds majority of 228 necessary for approval of a constitutional amendment because so many members were absent or abstaining. The Lithuanian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is due for a showdown with the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> on Dec. 19, when its party congress is to vote on a plan to separate from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and on a program that includes support for Lithuanian independence. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has spoken out sharply against both moves, but <ORGANIZATION> Lithuanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders say they must change or face certain defeat in upcoming elections.

 Prime Minister V.P. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION>'s holiest shrine, the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, on Thursday in a major initiative by his government to end the lingering secessionist campaign by Sikh militants. It was the first visit by a prime minister to the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> in more than five years, since shortly after a bloody army raid that led to the assassination of Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. `` Too much bloodshed has taken place,'' the Hindu prime minister told about 20,000 Sikhs inside the 14th century shrine. `` The time has come to win the hearts of the people.'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, a judge formally dropped charges against four Sikhs accused of participating in the Oct. 31, 1984, assassination of Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was shot and killed by two Sikh bodyguards angered by the army attack she ordered on the Golden Temple in June 1984 to drive out <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> militants using it as a base. One assassin was shot and killed by security men. The other was convicted along with an accomplice and both were hanged in January. Conspiracy charges were later filed against four other Sikhs. Last week, the government said it would withdraw the charges in a conciliatory move toward the Sikh community. `` One does wonder why the move was not made earlier,'' said Judge <PERSON> Jaspal </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, himself a Sikh, in ordering the charges dropped. All Sikhs and many Hindus use the name <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, which means lion. Two of the Sikhs accused of conspiracy were elected to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in last month's general elections, in which V.P. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> coalition </ORGANIZATION> prevented <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s son and successor, from returning to power. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was sworn in as prime minister Saturday and said solving the Sikh dispute in the northern state of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> would be one of his top priorities. On Wednesday, he made an effort to heal rifts between Hindus and Moslems by by appointing a Moslem, <PERSON> Mufti </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON>, to the key job of minister of home affairs. Religious riots this fall left at least 300 people dead. His visit to the Golden Temple was noticeable for the almost total lack of bodyguards, who surrounded <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> during his public appearances. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> traveled in an open jeep from <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Raja </PERSON> <PERSON> Sansi </PERSON> airport to the temple after refusing to sit in a bulletproof sedan. `` Your love to me is my security,'' the prime minister told the gathering at the gold-domed temple. `` I have not come here for any political or governmental purposes. I have come to perform prayers in the holy shrine so that peace and normalcy can be restored.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was the last prime minister to visit the temple. She came a week after the army raid. The Sikh secessionist campaign was launched by a small group of radicals in 1982 and exacerbated by the raid on the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> and by anti-Sikh riots in northern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> after Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s assassination At least 1,200 people died in the army raid, and the temple suffered heavy damage, turning even moderate Sikhs against the government. At least 3,000 Sikhs were killed in ensuing riots. Sikhs, easily identifiable by the their long hair, flowing beards and colorful turbans, form only 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 880 million people but are a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. Sikh militants say their community is discriminated against by the Hindus, who make up about 80 percent of the population. Officials say at least 7,500 people have been killed in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> since the Sikh campaign began. <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> Governor <PERSON> Sidhartha </PERSON> <PERSON> Shankar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> resigned Thursday and was replaced by <PERSON> Nirmal </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mukarji </PERSON>, an appointee of the new government. The state is ruled by the federal government in the absence of an elected legislative assembly, and the governor is the top administrator.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it is investigating political contributions by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the main figure in the nation's largest savings and loan failure, who arranged for $ 1.3 million in donations to the campaigns and causes of five senators. The investigation initially is focusing on contributions by <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, family members and corporate associates to Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., who requested the probe, the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> said But the investigation could spread to four <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senators who _ along with <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> _ intervened with banking regulators on <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'s behalf if the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> feels that `` there are other problems or other violations under the Federal Electon Campaign Act,'' commission spokesman <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Moxley </PERSON> said. The meetings with regulators began in 1987 when <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> and Loan was collapsing The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee is now conducting a fact-finding inquiry into the case, which has enormous political consequences for <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, a rising <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> star, and for the Democrats: Majority Whip <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. All deny wrongdoing. Meanwhile, federal regulators asked a judge Thursday to dismiss a suit against them by <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> who contends his <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L was being operated soundly calls the government takeover `` capricious and arbitrary.'' <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, whose bank failure could cost taxpayers a record $ 2 billion or more to protect depositors, also contributed to other senators and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members, and those donations also could come under <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> scrutiny. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, once asked if his financial support of politicians would influence them to take up his causes replied: `` I want to say in the most forceful way I can, I certainly hope so.'' <PERSON> Moxley </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the commission _ which administers the nation's campaign finance laws _ began its investigation after receiving a letter from <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> Oct. 30 seeking the probe. A spokesmen for <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> was not immediately available for comment. Contributions to the five senators, made during the mid-1980s, came from <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, his immediate family members and from officials of his companies that included <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; its parent Phoenix-based company, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and other subsidiaries of American <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. Spouses of these corporate officials also gave donations. Federal law limits contributions to campaigns to $ 1,000 per individual for each election. Many of the contributions from <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> and his associates were given on the same day in separate $ 1,000 donations. For instance, when The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> requested an <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> check of campaign contributions made on a particular day, the agency's computer found nearly three dozen separate $ 1,000 donations from <LOCATION> Keating </LOCATION> associates or family members to then-Sen Chic Hecht, R-Nev. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> himself was not on the list on the day checked, Nov. 18, 1988 The law prohibits anyone from making a donation on behalf of someone else. For instance, <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> could not have his corporate officers give $ 1,000 each under their names and reimburse them later to skirt the donation limit. <PERSON> Moxley </PERSON> said, however, the law is unclear on whether someone could ask his associates to contribute without reimbursing them. <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said in his request to the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> that representatives of his 1982 and 1984 House campaigns, and his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign of 1986, `` assure me that on their face those contributions comply with federal election law.'' `` If these contributions resulted from illegal activities of the corporations who employed these contributors, it is not evident in the committees' records or on publicly available information,'' he said. But <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> expressed concern that any `` potentially illegal action by corporations and contributors be reviewed as rapidly as possible.'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> received $ 112,000 in campaign contributions from <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> and associates, and promised to `` promptly refund'' any money given improperly. He previously announced he was reimbursing <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> $ 13,433 for flights he and his family took aboard <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'s corporate plane to and from the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> in 1984-86. <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> received $ 48,100 for his 1988 re-election campaign but announced he was returning the money. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, the No. 2 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrat as majority whip, received $ 39,000 in campaign money. He solicited from <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> $ 850,000 for three voter education projects in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and $ 85,000 for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> has jurisdiction only over contributions for federal campaigns. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> received $ 34,000 in direct contributions and a political action committee associated with him was given $ 200,000. <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> received $ 76,100 for his 1988 re-election campaign but announced he was returning the money.

 Reeling from voters' overwhelming rejection of three tax increases, the governor is proposing $ 98 million in budget cuts that could signal major changes for his economically strapped state. `` It's difficult to get people to look at the complexity of an issue like this,'' Democratic Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinner </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` I tried hard. But I do n't think I achieved the message. I really do n't.'' He spent weeks campaigning on behalf of higher state income, sales and gasoline taxes, a year after he easily won re-election against a Republican opponent who ran on an anti-tax platform. But <PERSON> North </PERSON> <PERSON> Dakotans </PERSON> thronged to the polls Tuesday to defeat those tax measures as well as five other issues proposing mandatory seat belts, video gambling, sex education for schools, legislative pensions and the reorganization of state government. `` People were in the mood to vote no, and once they started voting no, they just kept going,'' said former state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Tish </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>. Turnout was unofficially counted at 253,429, or 53 percent of the state's estimated voting population, a record turnout for a special election. Of the three defeated tax measures, a proposal to raise the state sales tax from 5 percent to 6 percent fared best. It lost by 53-47 percent. Increases in income and gasoline taxes were rejected by 60-40 percent. Sinner's proposed cuts, which are subject to legislative approval, would hit public schools hardest. Elementary and secondary education would lose $ 34 million, according to state <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> documents. The state's higher education system faces a possible $ 24 million cut and state human services a $ 21 million reduction. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s general fund budget totals $ 1.12 billion during the current two-year budgeting period, which ends June 30, 1991. Sinner may call lawmakers into special session early next year, but he plans to consult legislative leaders before making his decision. The state is celebrating its centennial year, but its past decade has been bittersweet. The economy relies heavily on farming and energy production and has suffered from drought and low prices for oil and wheat. North Dakota farmers got more than $ 400 million in drought aid last year. The latest campaign was the governor's second in three years to raise taxes. In 1987, he took a leading role in persuading voters to endorse an income tax increase, which was approved while the Legislature was in session. But Wednesday, he said his latest effort may have been a waste. `` It's easy to see why this budget is so extremely tight, and yet the people never really seem to perceive that,'' Sinner said. He contended tax increases are needed to maintain existing services. Sinner, who has talked of running for a third term, shrugged off questions about the political damage from his tax campaign. `` It's way too early for me to think about that,'' said <PERSON> Sinner </PERSON>, whose four-year term ends at the end of 1992. He added, `` I did n't take the job because I wanted to perpetuate myself in office. Opponents of the tax increases said the governor has failed to pare spending enough, and that farmers and businesses can not afford a heavier tax burden. `` Governor Sinner needs to put more of his energy into economic development,'' said <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Bismarck </LOCATION> businessman who led opposition to the taxes. `` Instead, he's spent his time trying to raise taxes.'' Legislators sensed anger in the vote. `` There seems to be a bitterness,'' said Democratic state Sen. <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>. `` <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> people are short of money and hurting, and to me -LRB- the election -RRB- was almost a striking out.'' Voters have had it with taxes and government, said Sen. <PERSON> Bryce </PERSON> <PERSON> Streibel </PERSON>, a Republican. `` Government is no longer a servant of the people,'' he said. `` It's become a monster.''

 A safe driving record and living in a low-crime area are two ways to get lower auto insurance rates, but being elected to the Legislature might be more effective. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> are the only two states that reimburse legislators for the lease and insurance on their cars. A vote on a compromise insurance reform bill is expected next week in the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Legislature, where the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in June voted down a proposal that would have cut rates by about 25 percent. <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s rates are among the highest in the nation, fueled in part, The <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> said, by legislation that was drafted by lobbyists for the insurance industry and trial lawyers, who benefit from personal-injury lawsuits. Two state senators are not reimbursed for car insurance. One does n't have a driver's license or car and the other is Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON>. All 48 other senators have the taxpayers cover most of their insurance premiums. `` I think to the extent that every time my insurance goes up I feel the pain too _ that makes me like the people I represent,'' <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Chakka </PERSON> <PERSON> Fattah </PERSON>, who paid $ 184 to insure his 1989 <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> last year, said it is unfair to say that legislators do n't care about the insurance issue because their car insurance is paid by the state. `` That's just like saying because we have jobs we would n't be concerned about unemployment,'' <PERSON> Fattah </PERSON> said. State Insurance Commissioner <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said the state's reimbursement policy could make it more difficult for legislators to adopt reform legislation. `` If a person is isolated from the problem, it's very easy to minimize it _ even if they have teen-age sons and daughters,'' she said.

Foster has the use of a state-owned and - insured 1989 Buick Century State records show that many <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> lawmakers lease late-model Cadillacs, Lincolns and other luxury cars. The insurance on those cars runs from several hundred dollars a year for rural legislators to thousands for <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> lawmakers. Under House rules, representatives can be reimbursed for up to 100 percent for their car insurance. Senators can be reimbursed up to 95 percent. Many legislators said that such a benefit is normal in business and that it helps them perform their jobs better. They also disputed that the practice insulates them from the high cost of insurance because they still have to pay for insurance on personal and family cars.

 A jailed East German official accused of embezzling will fight extradition back to the Communist country, saying the growing turmoil makes a fair trial unlikely, his lawyer said Thursday. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Schalck-Golodkowski </PERSON> fled the country after prosecutors disclosed he was operating a weapons ring selling arms to countries in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The growing scandal already has led to one suicide and the arrest of <PERSON> Schalck-Golodkowski </PERSON>'s deputy for allegedly taking $ 110 million in West German marks out of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Such allegations are particularly embarrassing for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which for years has claimed that it needs more Western currency to support its economy. <PERSON> Schalck-Golodkowski </PERSON> had supervised the various government-owned businesses that brought in the badly needed Western money. He disappeared while on an official visit to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on Saturday, quickly becoming the target of an international manhunt that added even more damaging publicity to the deeply troubled nation. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, a small party that recently broke with the Communists, said the allegations made the country look like a `` banana republic.'' <PERSON> Schalck-Golodkowski </PERSON> turned himself in to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> authorities Wednesday night and immediately promised to repay $ 31 million to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> from Swiss bank accounts. That is only a small part of what <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s official news media claim he embezzled. In an interview with a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> TV station, the former official's lawyer, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Danckert </PERSON>, said his client would resist being returned to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for trial. <PERSON> Danckert </PERSON> said that `` the uncertainty that we have seen everywhere in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'' made a fair trial unlikely. The national frenzy aimed at punishing past corruption has led <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> officials to warn that calls for `` revenge against the guilty'' were sparking widespread fears. <PERSON> Danckert </PERSON> said <PERSON> Schalck-Golodkowski </PERSON> would appeal to the West German <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> if necessary to avoid an extradition. On Thursday, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> prosecutor <PERSON> Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Schalck-Golodkowski </PERSON> would stay in jail indefinitely and that the former East German official `` feels that he is not guilty.'' The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> prosecutor added that an extradition to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is still possible based on the Communist nation's arrest warrant for embezzlement. The charge carries a maximum of 10 years in prison. However, <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> said his office had not turned over anyone to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for prosecution in 20 years and that it was possible he would be set free. <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Schalck-Golodkowski </PERSON> could be tried on the allegations in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, if the East Germans can prove he committed the crimes. On Wednesday, the official East German news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> reported the suicide of an official caught two days earlier trying to leave a government building with two suitcases stuffed with East German and West German money. ADN did not give his name, but said he was connected to the <PERSON> Schalck-Golodkowski </PERSON> case. <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidel </PERSON>, who served as <PERSON> Schalck-Golodkowski </PERSON>'s deputy, was arrested on suspicion of having smuggled $ 110 million in West Germank marks out of the country.

 `` Lobzilla,'' a gigantic lobster spared a date with a boiling pot after a wave of public sympathy, was flown from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> by an animal rights group Thursday to be returned to the ocean. But the group did n't get to make the release. State marine patrol agents confiscated the illegally oversized crustacean _ and then released it themselves.

But after some publicity from an animal rights group, manager <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Larkins </PERSON> decided to give <LOCATION> Lobzilla </LOCATION> to the group, gratis. <PERSON> Larkins </PERSON> said the lobster measured more than 3 feet when stretched out. `` Oh, he's so beautiful,'' said <PERSON> Cam </PERSON> <PERSON> MacQueen </PERSON>, of People for the <ORGANIZATION> Ethical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animals </ORGANIZATION>, who accompanied the lobster which traveled in an icebox labeled: `` Eat beans, not beings.'' `` He is truly majestic, incredible to look at,'' said Ms. <PERSON> MacQueen </PERSON>, who estimated his age at 150 years. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> of the Washington-based animal rights group said the group picked <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Lobzilla </ORGANIZATION>'s release because state law does not permit the taking of lobsters whose shells measure more than 5 inches, in order to preserve large ones for breeding. Because that law also prohibits possession of oversize lobsters, marine patrol agents confiscated <PERSON> Lobzilla </PERSON> on arrival, then went ahead and released it.

 A thousand people gathered at two sites today to remember the `` day of infamy'' that killed more than 2,000 servicemen and brought the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> into World War II. Ceremonies on the 48th anniversary of the Dec. 7, 1941, Japanese attack on <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> included a moment of silence and a 21-gun salute. Simultaneous ceremonies were held by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> aboard the aboard the USS Arizona Memorial, where about 100 guests attended, and onshore at the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> Memorial Visitors Center. The shore ceremony, open to the public and sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which runs the center, attracted about 900 people. Adm. <PERSON> Huntington </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardisty </PERSON>, commander of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, spoke at the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ceremony, alluding to the new peace initiatives between the East and West blocs. `` As the opportunity arises to reduce tensions and the potential for open conflict, we should seize it and support it,'' he said.

The speaker at the public ceremony was retired Rear Adm. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Dybdal </PERSON>, who was a gunnery officer aboard the USS Helm during the attack.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> claimed Thursday it has test-fired two long-range missiles and successfully launched a rocket able to carry satellites into space, developments that could affect the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>'s military balance. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamel </PERSON>, minister of industry and military industrialization, said the three-stage rocket was launched Tuesday from the <LOCATION> Al-Anbar </LOCATION> space research center 50 miles west of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. He also claimed in a statement broadcast by state-run <ORGANIZATION> Baghdad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has test-fired two surface-to-surface missiles with a range of 1,240 miles. That is enough to reach <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> to the west, <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION> to the northwest, all of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to the east, and the southern <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to the north. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s other main foes, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, are already within range of missiles reported in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s armory. If the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> claims are true, the developments will heighten Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fears of a new arms race in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said he had heard reports <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had developed intercontinental ballistic missile but knew nothing about their validity. <PERSON> Kamel </PERSON> gave no details of the surface-to-surface missiles and did not say when the test-firings occurred. The heaviest missile the Iraqis are believed to have developed is the al-Hussain, with a range of about 560 miles. There was no independent confirmation of Tuesday's reported rocket launch, but <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> TV showed what it said was footage of it. <PERSON> Kamel </PERSON> said the rocket weighed 48 tons, bigger than anything the Iraqis were believed to possess. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polaris </ORGANIZATION> nuclear missile weighs only 13 tons. `` It's a big leap,'' said <PERSON> Hans-Heino </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopietz </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> analyst with <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Iraqis are known to have been working on some big projects and we must assume this was one of them.'' `` What we must anticipate now, if this report proves to be correct, is how <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s neighbors will react.'' Israeli officials refused comment and there was no immediate reaction from other <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> capitals. <PERSON> Kamel </PERSON> said the rocket will be used to launch a satellite for scientific research at an unspecified date. He said the launch was the first stage of an Iraqi space research program and called it `` the springboard for further achievements in space technology.'' But it also would enable <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> to spy on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s main rivals in the region, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> fought an eight-year war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> that was halted by a cease-fire last year. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s archrival in the Arab world, was allied with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> during the war. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is the only <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> country to claim the capability of launching satellites. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is the only <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> country known to have satellite capability. <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> has been driving to develop an aerospace industry for some time and has spent billions of dollars on missile development. The most ambitious part of the program was development of a two-stage ballistic missile with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> based on <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s Condor missile. Intelligence sources have said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is negotiating with <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s space agency and the French to help it acquire a surveillance satellite <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> launched the Ofek-1 satellite Sept. 19, 1988. It said Ofek-1 was designed for scientific research, but <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> governments fear it will be used as a spy satellite. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has said it is working on an Ofek-2 satellite. The official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported the Israelis launched a ballistic missile Sept. 14. The Israelis denied it, but Western intelligence believes the reported firing could have been an abortive effort to launch Ofek-2.

 Rival Shiite militias fought in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Thursday during a general strike to protest alleged attempts by <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, the rebellious Christian general, to partition <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Police said no casualty reports were available on the battle between the the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>, a more moderate militia supported by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. `` Luckily this clash broke out on a day of general strike, which decreases casualties among civilians,'' said a police spokesman, whose name was withheld in keeping with regulations. Amal and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters started shooting at midday in the densely populated <LOCATION> Basta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Khandaq </LOCATION> <LOCATION> al-Ghamiq </LOCATION> districts of the Moslem sector, which is patrolled by Syrian soldiers, the spokesman reported. He said tension was `` gradually spreading'' despite efforts by the Syrians to contain the trouble. The Syrian command sent hundreds of its soldiers to districts bordering <LOCATION> Basta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Khandaq </LOCATION> <LOCATION> al-Ghamiq </LOCATION>. Automatic weapons fire and the thud of exploding rocket-propelled grenades could be heard across west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, and radio stations interrupted regular programming with reports on the violence. The police spokesman said the confrontation `` could spread quickly.'' Fighting broke out in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> two days after <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> drove <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> from the western part of the Syrian-occupied <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, destroying the five major <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> bases in <LOCATION> Sohmor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yohmor </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mashgara </LOCATION> villages. Police gave casualties in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> confrontation as 17 combatants killed _ 16 from <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> and one from <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> _ and 42 wounded. The two factions have fought since May 1987 for supremacy among the 1.2 million Shiites, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s largest sect. Police say 552 people have been killed and 1,532 wounded. Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> alliance of pro-Syrian leftist and Moslem groups called the strike in Moslem areas to `` denounce attempts to partition the nation.'' President <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>, a Christian like <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, presided over a meeting of his government at an army barracks in Syrian-policed east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and issued a statement saying `` several decisions were adopted regarding ways of ending the partition scheme.'' No details were given. The government urged `` all concerned to join the unifying policy of the legal authority to abort the partition scheme.'' Moderate Christian leaders have joined Moslems in supporting <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>, who was elected by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 23 with a mandate to implement a peace agreement designed to end the 14-year-old civil war. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> rejected <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>'s election and opposes the peace accord because it does not include a timetable for withdrawal of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s 40,000 troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> He commands 20,000 Christian troops from a bunker beneath the presidential palace in the Christian suburb of <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>, and refuses to leave. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has ringed the 310-square-mile Christian enclave east and north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> with tanks, artillery and thousands of soldiers. <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> has given mediators two weeks to convince <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> to leave the palace peacefully.

Officials had prepared for violence if the Colombian-born <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> had been acquitted, but also stressed their hopes for calm in the hours before the verdict was announced. `` We're really concerned about the media coverage and implications that this is something that would be almost expected from a community,'' Mayor <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> said today on `` CBS This Morning.'' `` I think the community is ready to accept the verdict. All the leaders have called for tranquility and serenity in all the communities in our city. I'm very pleased to see that approach being taken.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> called a last-minute conference with social workers before they were sent out speak with residents, said assistant director <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Major </ORGANIZATION>. Forty-five police cars had formed a perimeter around <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> and black sections of Coconut Grove, and officers have been issued riot equipment as a precautionary measure. `` We do n't want to have storm troopers out there and have 400 policemen running around the city,'' police spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivero </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` We have just our normal patrols out there in the city right now, but as soon as anything starts, we are going to go in and arrest people.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who is black, on Wednesday walked the streets of <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION>, the neighborhood where the shooting occurred. `` Will we have justice this time?'' one resident asked the chief. `` I think so,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> replied, patting the man on the shoulder. The rumors of a verdict had grown so strong Wednesday afternoon that downtown workers reportedly left their jobs early, and <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s Chief Circuit Judge <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Wetherington </PERSON> went on the air to assure the public that the jury had reached no decision.

 An appeals court on Thursday upheld the acquittal of director <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON>, who was charged with contempt of religion for his film `` The Last Temptation of Christ.'' <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Biennale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Paolo </PERSON> <PERSON> Portoghesi </PERSON> were cleared of violating Italian laws on obscenity and blasphemy in the showing of the movie at the <ORGANIZATION> Venice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>. Judges initially decided to take no action against <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON> or the festival organizer. But an appeals court in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> ruled the case should be considered by a <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> criminal court, which found Scorsese and <PERSON> Portoghesi </PERSON> innocent. The <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> court's upholding of the acquittal is final, because the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has declined to accept the case. Protesters who prompted the criminal case in fall 1988 said the movie was sacrilegious, particularly a scene in which <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> hallucinates on the cross about abandoning his role as redeemer, making love to <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdalene </PERSON> and raising a family with her.

<HEAD>Bush Signs Bill Expanding Federal Damage Payments</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed legislation Thursday giving the attorney general the authority to settle claims of up to $ 50,000 for injuries or damage caused by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents executing their duties. The measure amends a 1936 statute that had limited such damage payments to $ 500. It also expands the settlement authority to cover other federal law enforcement agencies, including the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION>. The expanded settlement authority is intended to cover incidents ranging from broken walls and doors to personal injury or deaths resulting from properly executed law enforcement activities by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and other federal agencies. If negligence were involved, the victims already had a right to sue the government for much larger damages than $ 500 under the Federal Tort Claims Act. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also signed legislation allowing disabled <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans to receive Agent Orange settlement payments without jeopardizing their eligibility for other federal disability or welfare aid. That measure excludes the Agent Orange payments from consideration of the veterans' assets for means-tested federal programs. Veterans who suffered health problems linked to the herbicide sprayed as a defoliant during the Vietnam War can receive up to $ 12,800 from a $ 180 million Agent Orange settlement fund. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed a raft of other measures before departing the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on a two-day trip to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Des </PERSON> <PERSON> Moines </PERSON>. Among them were: _ A new four-year authorization for ACTION, the 25-year-old domestic version of the Peace Corps It includes a $ 15 increase in the $ 75-a-month stipend for the 2,600 volunteers, who have not a raise since 1976. The stipend will also go from $ 90 to $ 95 in fiscal 1991.

<HEAD>Major Defense Cutback Announced in South Africa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> announced a major defense cutback Thursday, cutting mandatory military service in half and promising to close some military units and facilities. He also suggested that some career military men and employees of the national arms manufacturing company may lose their jobs. The announcement came two weeks after <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> completed the withdrawal of its troops from <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, where they had fought a bush war against pro-independence guerrillas since 1966. A year ago, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> signed a treaty that cleared the way for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s independence and also halted South African involvement in the civil war in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s northern neighbor <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s announcement marked the second time in 10 days he has taken action counter to standing policies of the security establishment that held strong influence under his predecessor, P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>. On Nov. 28, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> scrapped a nationwide security network that was denounced as an unaccountable shadow government. When the Namibian and South African-Angolan wars ended, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> chiefs and the Defense Minsiter <PERSON> Magnus </PERSON> <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> had said there would be no cutbacks or service reductions because the government still had to defend its borders against guerrilla infiltration from surrounding countries. Last week, <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> reversed himself, saying it was no longer necessary for South African forces to stage cross-border raids or support anti-government groups in neighboring countries. The military units <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> has suggested eliminating may be those involved in such clandestine actions. He said details would be given next year. <PERSON> Zach </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Beer </PERSON>, a leader of the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s action was `` an indication that the relationship between ourselves and our neighbors in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> have improved and we look forward to a more peaceful time.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is ... concerned that the state president's unilateral and over-hasty decision will be detrimental to state security,'' said <PERSON> Koos </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Merwe </PERSON>, defense spokesman for the largest white opposition party. He warned against creation of a `` peace pscyhosis,'' when, he said, the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was continuing its guerrilla actions. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Merwe </PERSON> suggested that rather than reducing the strength of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, the extra soldiers be assigned to the undermanned police force, and that black, Indian and mixed-race men also be subject to conscription. Now, only white men can be conscripted. Military service for other races is voluntary. De Beer, as well as several business organizations, said the reduction in military service would help the economy by slowing the `` brain drain'' of young men who leave the country rather than serve, diminish disruption of careers and allow more educated men to enter the workforce earlier. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, opening a new headquarters for the state arms manufacturing corporation, indicated that conscripts already in the military would have their terms of service shortened, new draftees would serve one year instead of two, and the number of recalls to temporary service would be reduced. The End Conscription Campaign, a restricted organization that wants young men to be given a choice between military and community service, said, `` This reduction does not remove the huge dilemma facing conscripts who still have to choose whether to serve in an apartheid army.'' In September, 780 white men vowed not to perform military service, the largest defiance ever of conscription laws. Draft resisters face prison terms of up to six years, or 1 -LCB- times the amount of unfulfilled service. Three men are serving six-year terms. The government does not release information on the manpower of the armed forces. However, at any given time in recent years, there have been as estimated 68,000 conscripts on active duty and about 325,000 men in the reserves out of the roughly 2.4 million white males of all ages in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The president said efforts would be made to find new jobs for career military personnel and employees of <ORGANIZATION> Armscor </ORGANIZATION>, the government-owned weapons company, who might lose their jobs as part of the cutback.

 A senior <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said Thursday that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s government has embarked on `` a clear pattern of abuses'' designed to intimidate opposition political activists and voters before February's national elections. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for international organization affairs, said the political opposition has grown to represent a real threat to continued Sandinista power in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, and the government has responded with `` tactics designed to discredit, confuse and intimidate the opposition and its supporters.'' <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> also released a letter he had sent this week to <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, the chief <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s elections, detailing more than a dozen attacks and threats aimed at opposition political figures and their supporters in recent weeks. <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> said the incidents would make it difficult for <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, a former attorney general, to certify following the Feb. 25 voting that the elections were free and fair in accordance with a regional peace agreement signed by the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> regime and its four Central American neighbors. In a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON>, the vice presidential candidate of the opposition coalition <ORGANIZATION> UNO </ORGANIZATION>, had been stopped by soldiers on Nov. 26 in the town of <LOCATION> Pantasma </LOCATION>. When <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON> complained that two of his supporters had been beaten and detained by the army, the soldiers responded that the opposition had been throwing rocks and then threatened to fire on the candidate and his party. That and other incidents `` present a clear pattern of abuses designed to interfere with the open, free and fair electoral process that the Sandinistas are pledged to uphold,'' <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON>, in a letter to <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, also cited the Nicaraguan government's refusal to provide visas for a 20-member <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressional election observer group appointed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. In rejecting the visa requests last week, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could not claim objectivity because it was providing $ 9 million in support to the electoral process to enhance <ORGANIZATION> UNO </ORGANIZATION>'s chances and was continuing to funnel support to the anti-Sandinista Contra rebels, many of whom have re-infiltrated into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> dismissed those arguments, noting that `` humanitarian'' aid to the rebels is permitted in the regional peace accord and that Nicaraguan law permits outside financial aid to political parties.

<TEXT>
 Sixty-eight human rights monitors were killed worldwide in the last year, double the number in the previous 12 months, an international human rights monitoring organization said Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION> said 63 of the killings were in countries usually considered to be democratic, but added in its annual report that `` the danger in democratic countries ... is, of course, not an argument in favor of dictatorships of the right or of the left.'' The organization said it had little or no information on persecutions of human rights monitors in <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> because it is virtually impossible for citizens in those countries to monitor government activities. Nevertheless, the report said, `` the dangers that attend efforts to monitor and defend human rights in some ` democracies' should give pause to those who have celebrated the democratic tide that has swept across the world in the 1980s.'' `` At least in a number of Latin American and East Asian countries, the advent of electoral democracy has not meant great advances in respect for human rights.'' `` It is when a certain degree of openness prevails but when the rule of law has not been established that the perils are greatest,'' the organization said. In <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, where the group said a history of human rights violations has been exacerbated by the violence associated with the drug trade, 24 human rights monitors were killed, more than in any other country. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> was second with 14 and `` many of the cases reflect the intense struggle over land distribution in rural areas,'' Human Rights Watch said. The 345-page report discussed 1,200 cases of persecution of human rights monitors in 72 countries, including arrest, imprisonment and torture of people who gather and disseminate information on their own governments' human rights abuses. <PERSON> Aryeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Neier </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, where a new reformist government has come to power, was second only to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in the total number of cases. But he said many of those listed had been released about two weeks before the report was issued. `` Not all the people we care about in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> have yet been released, so there is a way to go,'' <PERSON> Neier </PERSON> added. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> takes up 36 pages in the report and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> 23. The report devoted only six pages to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but said some of the thousands arrested after the June 3-4 disturbances in Tiananmen Square were known to have been signers of statements and petitions on human rights issues. In addition to the 68 killings, 10 more human rights monitors `` disappeared'' after being taken into custody, the organization said. Human Rights Watch is made up of five regional committees: <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Watch </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Watch </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> Watch, <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Watch </LOCATION>.

 Strict new financial standards effective Thursday will force more than a third of the nation's savings institutions to shrink or shut down if they ca n't raise new capital. Only 1,800 of 2,900 S & amp; Ls have enough capital to satisfy the requirement, prompting industry analysts to nickname the deadline `` Pearl Harbor Day'' because it coincides with the 48th anniversary of the Japanese attack on <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. `` It's a good analogy, except in one respect,'' said economist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Litan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> think tank. `` This was n't a sneak attack. -LRB- S & amp; Ls -RRB- should have known this was coming a long time ago.'' The new rules were required under <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L bailout legislation enacted Aug. 9 and are considered the cornerstone reform of the bill. The Office of Thrift Supervision published them Nov. 6. Advocates of forcing S & amp; L owners to back their lending with more of their own money say the measure will encourage institutions to avoid risky investments that could run up big losses for the government deposit insurance fund. Of the 1,100 institutions falling short of the standard, about 300 are already insolvent and due to be transferred to the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for liquidation. Of the 800 remaining, about 270 likely will be able to shrink or raise capital on their own and about 230 likely wo n't be able to do it before mandatory growth restrictions take effect on Jan. 1, 1991, <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, director of the thrift office, said Thursday. `` Then 300 in the middle are candidates for the matchmaker program, blind dates, arranged marriages, however you want to put it,'' <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accountants </ORGANIZATION> Thursday in a reference to a thrift office program aimed at matching weak S & amp; Ls with merger partners. Private analysts, however, are skeptical about the prospects for capital-deficient institutions. `` There are very good reasons to question whether the guys in the middle will survive, certainly in their present form,'' <PERSON> Litan </PERSON> said. `` ` The most likely strategy will be shrinkage because they will not be successful in attracting new capital. There's a pall hanging over the entire thrift industry, which makes investors nervous.'' Anticipating the rules, <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls have been shrinking, shedding a record $ 15.2 billion in assets in September and $ 13.3 billion in August, according to the latest report available. <PERSON> Litan </PERSON> and another economist, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Getman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Wefa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said another provision in the thrift bill requiring S & amp; Ls to concentrate 70 percent of their assets on housing loans, up from 60 percent, is discouraging investors and virtually forcing the shrinkage. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is saying to thrifts, ` Put all your eggs in one basket,' and that basket is looking real shaky,'' <PERSON> Getman </PERSON> said, noting weakening real estate markets in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> on top of already soft markets in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>. `` This is setting up the industry for what will be a knockout punch in the early 1990s,'' he said, predicting that the Southeast will be the next region with real estate problems. `` The right analogy to draw for these 800 thrifts is they are like prisoners on death row. They have another 15 years to live,'' <PERSON> Getman </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Government Says Monument Demonstrations Cannot Be Tolerated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KRAKOW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Solidarity-led government said Thursday it wo n't tolerate more demonstrations at monument to <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> where anti-Soviet protesters trying to destroy the statue have twice clashed with police. Protesters chanting `` Soviets go home!'' hurled paint, gasoline and explosives at the monument and fueled the fire with park benches in a demonstration that lasted until midnight Wednesday. Police used water cannon and tear gas to disperse the demonstrators after they marched to a militia headquarters, pelted officers with stones and tossed Molotov cocktails, the official <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. Twenty people were injured _ 13 of them police, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said. Damage was estimated at $ 6,000, including a jewelry store looted after its windows were smashed. Another demonstration turned violent Nov. 29 at the statue to the founder of the Soviet state that dominates a square in the <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION>, built in the 1950s as a model socialist industrial city. `` The problem of the location of the monument should be decided by inhabitants of this district of <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> in legal forums,'' the government statement said. `` Vandalism and hooliganism are something else. Such activities can not be tolerated,'' it continued. `` The forces of order, acting in accordance with the law, will be forced to take firmer steps in order to prevent such dangerous excesses.'' The youthful demonstrators, gathered by a radical group known as Movement for an <ORGANIZATION> Alternative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, have been an embarrassment for the government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Taduesz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, formed of former opposition forces who now must maintain relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The police action Nov. 29 was apparently the first large-scale use of force against demonstrators since Solidarity took over the government in August. The Solidarity committee for the southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> region has adopted a resolution asking local authorities to remove the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> monument to prevent further disturbances, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. `` Our resolution is not dictated by political reasons but by concern over security and order in the city,'' it said, according to <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION>. `` If a decision manifesting the will of society is not made immediately, stability will be threatened and district and municipal authorities will be to blame,'' it said. Not freely elected, the people's councils that form local governments have yet not been subject to the reform sweeping through the central government and are still dominated by communist party members. <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Suchonski </PERSON>, a member of the <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> council, told <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> two possible solutions were being considered: `` Either to prevent such further events or, having heard the opinion of <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> inhabitants, to move the monument to a different place.'' <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON>, a Solidarity parliament deputy serving as a mediator in the monument dispute, said Thursday that only removal of the statue can end the demonstrations, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> reported.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has bought 410,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat at subsidized prices for delivery in 1989-90, the seventh year of a long-term grain supply agreement, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. F. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickerson </PERSON>, general sales manager for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said shipments are scheduled in January and February The wheat was sold under the department's Export Enhancement Program, or <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, which provides subsidies to exporters selling <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commodities to designated foreign markets. <PERSON> Dickerson </PERSON> said only 14,200 tons of wheat remain in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s current <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> allocation of 1.5 million tons announced May 2. It was the second <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat sale since the seventh year of the long-term grain agreement began Oct. 1, although more than 10.3 million tons of corn have been sold for 1989-90 delivery, along with soybeans and soybean meal. A sale of 215,000 tons was reported on Monday. The pact runs through Dec. 31, 1990, and a new agreement is currently being negotiated. In 1988-89, the sixth year of the current agreement, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> bought about 5.4 million tons of wheat and more than 16.3 million tons of corn, plus soybeans, soybean meal and grain sorghums. A metric ton is 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat. The 410,000 tons are equal to more than 15 million bushels worth around $ 57 million at recent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm prices. <PERSON> Dickerson </PERSON> reported the subsidies at an average of $ 16.81 per ton, or about 46 cents per bushel. The <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices to meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or subsidies. <PERSON> Dickerson </PERSON> said the wheat was sold by <ORGANIZATION> Alfred </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toepfer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 150,000 tons; <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 135,000; <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 50,000; <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 25,000; <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 25,000; and <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 25,000. Since <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> began in 1985, more than $ 2.6 billion in subsidies have been paid to exporters to ship a variety of commodities to overseas customers. As of Nov. 30, sales totaled 87.2 million tons of grain, including 64.4 million tons of wheat. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the largest <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> beneficiary, has bought more than 17.5 million tons of wheat. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is second at 13.2 million tons of wheat, plus 185 head of cattle.

 Opening night of the <ORGANIZATION> Alvin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ailey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION>'s season became a tribute in words and dance to the founder of the troupe. The program was changed to include only dances choreographed by <PERSON> Ailey </PERSON> and ended with his early masterpiece, `` Revelations.'' The evening concluded with dancers, former dancers and crew members embracing on stage and piling flowers under a photograph of <PERSON> Ailey </PERSON> in his dancing years. <PERSON> Ailey </PERSON> died Friday of a blood disorder. He was 58. <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavallade </PERSON>, who danced with <PERSON> Ailey </PERSON>, said during Wednesday's program that <PERSON> Ailey </PERSON>'s dream may have started in high school, or before. `` I have been privileged to watch that dream grow from a tiny seed of a company at the 92nd Street Y to this wonderful, incredible company you see here tonight,'' she said. `` For the Y, he composed a dance about a man who fell in love with the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> and decided to catch it. <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> was the man and I was the moon. After I was carried around through the air and out, a silver sliver of a moon slid down a wire from my side to the stage to his. He caught the moon. That's what he caught _ his dream.'' <PERSON> Ailey </PERSON> started his troupe with seven members in 1958, dedicating it to the preservation and enrichment of the American modern dance heritage and the uniqueness of black cultural expression. Today the troupe numbers 28, many of them graduates of the <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailey </PERSON> American Dance Center. First as a dancer, than as a choreographer, <PERSON> Ailey </PERSON> was known for his jazz-oriented modern dance innovations that combined black and contemporary American cultural themes including jazz, blues, gospel, folk heroes and politics. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, chairman of the dance company's board, said the board will `` continue the great legacy of <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailey </PERSON>. We will build on his 31 years of creativity and see that his dreams are realized. `` Generations to come will be thrilled and inspired by the <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailey </PERSON> American Dance Theater.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Faison </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Ailey </LOCATION> dancer, now a choreographer, spoke after <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Banks </PERSON> danced to `` My Soul Is a Witness for My Lord.'' He said, `` We have seen <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailey </PERSON>'s glorification of the Lord and we have all been witnesses of <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailey </PERSON>'s human spirit.'' The evening began with <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Flack </PERSON> singing `` Always.'' `` Revelations,'' the audience's favorite <PERSON> Ailey </PERSON> creation, was danced in its entirety, to hymns sung by Brother <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sellers </PERSON>, other soloists and a choir. The evening ended with the audience leaving as Sellers sang `` Rocka My Soul in the Bosom of <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>.''

 Thousands of children and grownups jammed a park where <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> once coached girls' softball to show the president Thursday how they reclaimed the playground from drug dealers. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was proud of the neighborhood for joining together on what they call Independence Day, April 9, 1988, when 1,000 people went out to take <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Winzer </PERSON> <PERSON> Park </PERSON> back from drug dealers. `` Thank you not only for standing up to greet me, but also for standing up for <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> every day,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, noting that at one time the park had been so clogged with drug dealers even <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> police called it `` Crack In The Box.'' Bands, drill teams, cheerleaders, choirs, school mascots _ even a few children skipping school _ lined up hours before the president arrived in northeast <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> to review the results of the Acres Homes War on Drugs. Joining <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for the 20-minute ceremony were federal drug czar <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who visited the park in July, and Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. The visit was part of the president's two-day trip to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> to spotlight anti-drug efforts and boost Republican candidates In his remarks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> referred jocularly to the time he coached softball at the park during his congressional service in the 1960s. `` It was a great bunch of girls. They almost won state,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` In fact, I think I see our third baseman over there,'' he said, drawing a laugh from the crowd. The festive atmosphere Thursday was in stark contrast to the situation in the area two years ago, when drug dealers dominated the neighborhood. `` It was sad,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, a former high school football coach. `` I used to drive by here at lunch. There would be 25 cars lined up there for four or five guys selling whatever you wanted. Families just stopped coming here. People were afraid.'' The neighbors banded together, got their children involved, and started an aggressive neighborhood watch program that included writing down license numbers and turning alleged drug dealers into police. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> drew applause when he quoted <PERSON> Erma </PERSON> <PERSON> Scales </PERSON>, president of the Acres Homes War on Drugs, as saying, `` We need to teach our system of values, parents ... need to spend more time with their kids and ... go back to being parents, not just being buddies,'' he said. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, 34, came out Thursday with his 3-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Keandra </PERSON>. `` It's nice and peaceful now, but it was a lot of drug dealers and drug addicts here. It was just in turmoil. I could n't bring my kid out here. They would run out to every passing car and ask every passing car to buy drugs. `` But now that's all changed. I love it here.'' But police said the job is not finished. As crews worked Wednesday to ready the park for the president's visit, undercover police officers made three arrests in an hour for the sale of crack cocaine within a mile of the park

<HEAD>Opposition Says Kohl's Plan For Large Military Cuts Not Enough</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s political foes on Thursday complained that the government's tentative plans to shrink its military forces by nearly one-fifth do not go far enough. A day earlier, the government announced it intended to cut its forces from 480,000 members to 400,000 by the mid-1990s, but only if current East-West talks on reducing conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are successful. It would be the biggest reduction in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s armed forces ever. But <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Buelow </PERSON>, a federal lawmaker with the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON>'s plan does n't do enough to encourage disarmament and to help overcome divisions within <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` Why do n't you -LRB- <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> -RRB- work toward a structure that allows you to actively hurry along the demilitarization of the <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> conflict that would still protect our security?'' <PERSON> Buelow </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> at a heated parliamentary debate. The Social Democrats demanded that compulsory military service be cut from 15 months to 12 months. <PERSON> Buelow </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> should be thinking of possible ways to alter the character of the armed forces so there were n't so many offense-oriented elements. But <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said his plan foresaw the `` most significant new-ordering in the history of the Federal Republic's -LRB- <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s -RRB- armed forces.'' Pointing out that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> remained <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s front-line state, <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said the country's armed forces are an `` essential factor for stability in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'' and that this must not be jeopardized. `` It would be disastrous to put into question the alliance's and the -LRB- West German -RRB- army's roles as key elements for peace,'' <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said. In announcing its plan Wednesday, the government said it was taking the tentative steps to cut down on costs, because of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s low birth rate which means there will be fewer men for the armed forces, and because of the changing political situation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The demise of Communist governments in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has triggered a new debate in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> about what kinds of changes are possible within the country's own armed forces and within <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> as a whole. The Social Democrats and the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> party have been leading the calls for far-reaching changes, saying the threat from the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc has decreased dramatically. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s government says it wants quicker progress in arms control and disarmament, But it has also pledged <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will remain a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> member even if events in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> eventually permit unification of the two German nations. Some liberal members of <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s government have strayed from official government pronouncements on military matters. Education Minister <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Moellemann </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, junior partner in <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s coalition government, has said he thought 350,000 soldiers in the country's armed forces and a 12-month military service term would be sufficient.

 A car bomb planted by the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> exploded in a suburban shopping district Thursday, injuring 21 people and heavily damaging surrounding stores, police said. Police had evacuated the crowded shopping precinct in <LOCATION> Lisburn </LOCATION>, following an <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> warning telephoned to a radio station 20 minutes before the blast, the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Lisburn </LOCATION>, seven miles south of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, is the headquarters for the British army in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.

The <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said most of the injured police and civilians had minor cuts and were suffering from shock. Three people were admitted for surgery. A police spokesman said the bomb, packed into a <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> van parked near the Market Square shopping center, caused widespread damage. Police estimated the size of the bomb at 500 pounds. `` I saw a number of shops wrecked, windows blown out of the Presbyterian church and a number of fires,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Beattie </PERSON>, a local lawmaker.

 The local <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> commander has put his holiday bellringers on a $ 60 quota on daily donations in their Christmas kettles, contending he's just practicing good business. `` Our business practice requires that our costs should not exceed 50 percent of what we bring in,'' Capt. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilden </PERSON> said in justifying recent written warnings sent to two minimum-wage bellringers. The wife of one disgruntled bellringer, who said her husband was told he would lose his job if his collections did not pick up, claimed <PERSON> Gilden </PERSON>'s policy has prompted some bellringers to quit. <PERSON> Gilden </PERSON> acknowledged that one person quit, but others have had no trouble meeting the quota. He said the complaining worker, who was not identified, takes too many breaks, leaving his station unattended. `` I've placed him at various sites and his collections are always less than what was taken in the day before or the day after he was at the site,'' <PERSON> Gilden </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gliden </PERSON> said this year's Christmas drive is targeted to raise $ 30,000, about 10 percent more than last year.

 A `` substantially higher'' number of Hispanic Americans are overweight when compared to the rest of the nation, federal researchers reported Thursday. A survey of Mexican Americans in the West, Cuban Americans in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and Puerto Ricans in metropolitan <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> found overweight problems to be `` substantially higher than those reported for non-Hispanic Americans,'' the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> reported.

Among Cuban Americans, 29 percent of men and 34 percent of women were overweight. And among Puerto Ricans, 25 percent of men and 37 percent of women were overweight. Among non-Hispanics in another survey, overweight men accounted for 24 percent of whites and 25 percent of blacks. Among women, it was 25 percent of whites and 44 percent of blacks. The three Hispanic groups chosen account for about three-fourths of the Hispanic population in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. While the survey was not nationwide, it was a scientifically based sample in those three areas, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, a researcher with the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. The reasons for a trend toward overweight among Hispanic Americans are `` pure conjecture,'' said Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>. He noted that Hispanic Americans, in general, have lower income and education status than do white Americans, `` and people at the lower end of socioeconomics are at greater risk of being overweight _ this is an especially strong pattern among women.'' Why that is, he said, is again up for debate. The surveys were conducted as part of the statistics center's Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 1982-84 The term overweight in the survey was used for anyone whose `` body mass index'' _ a measurement of height and weight _ was in the top 15 percent of men or women in their 20s. `` Severely overweight'' indicated the top 5 percent. That designation applied to between 8 to 10 percent of Hispanic-American men and 8 to 16 percent of Hispanic-American women, compared with generally lower levels for non-Hispanics, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Hears Arguments in Citrus Canker Payments Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The citrus canker scare that led to the burning of 20 million fruit trees in the mid-1980s reached the state's highest court Thursday, with growers arguing that a compensation plan violates their rights. Attorneys for citrus growers and nursery owners told the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that a law passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> last spring providing a $ 30 million compensation fund and setting up an administrative hearing procedure denied them the right to have their day in court. Claims pending before the state list damages of at least $ 200 million. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Moody </PERSON>, one of three citrus industry attorneys, said the plan was wrong because the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> also made the decisions leading to the burning of the trees. Under basic separation of powers protections, he said, the courts are the correct forum for settling on payment for losses. `` The Constitution is what protects us from our own government,'' <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Are we going to let those taking the property determine the compensation for the property? The answer is no.'' Millions of citrus trees, mostly seedlings, were destroyed beginning in 1984 to halt the spread of canker, a disease that can lead to premature fruit drop and loss of the crop. Scientists have since concluded that most of the trees diagnosed with canker were suffering from a relatively harmless leaf-spotting disease, and most regulations aimed at preventing the spread of canker have been dropped. Lower courts supported the state's authority to destroy the trees because of fears that a serious disease was threatening the state's $ 1 billion citrus industry. But courts also have ruled that full compensation for destroyed trees is required. Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> said there are about 1,100 claims stemming from the canker eradication program. If those claims were taken to court, <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> said, it could cost the state at least $ 200 million. Seventy-six canker compensation cases have been filed in courts around the state, but the law passed last spring freezes them and directs they also go through an administrative process. A <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> judge ruled the law unconstitutional one day after it was signed by Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, and the state appealed. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevin </PERSON>, a former state attorney general representing the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, said the compensation program gives growers a way to press their claims in a reasonable way. `` We admit liability. We pay these folks,'' <PERSON> Shevin </PERSON> said. `` We believe we've provided an adequate alternative remedy that has adequate safeguards to ensure just compensation.'' Another government attorney, <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON>, said the system keeps intact growers' constitutional rights to a hearing. `` I submit that there is no substantive right diminished, much less taken away by this statute,'' said <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON>, representing <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, another citrus industry attorney, said the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitution </ORGANIZATION> protects a property owner's right to compensation when property is seized by government, but more importantly mandates that such a decision be made in a court. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> also said the law should not be applied retroactively to claims that already had been filed in state courts. The justices did not indicate when they would rule.

 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> should seize and support opportunities to reduce international tensions, the commander of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> said Thursday in commemorating the 48th anniversary of the <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> attack. `` But when we perceive a threat against the interests and security of the nation, we must continue to speak out, even if the tide of public opinion is running the other way,'' said Adm. <PERSON> Huntington </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardisty </PERSON> during a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ceremony aboard the USS Arizona Memorial. Hardisty noted that an 18-year-old sailor lost in the Dec. 7, 1941, attack by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would now be 66. That sailor would be pleased to see that the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> command is waging peace, <PERSON> Hardisty </PERSON> told about 100 invited guests. `` He would be pleased to see that our nation's security posture in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> is in good shape,'' Hardisty said. `` But I also think the sailor would sound a warning that peace requires strong, credible forces, and constant vigilence.'' A minute of silence was observed at 7:55 a.m., the time the air raid began. The minute ended with a flyover by <ORGANIZATION> Hawaii </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> jets in the `` missing man'' formation. Representatives of veterans, civic and patriotic organizations presented wreaths during the ceremony, which also included prayers and a 21-gun salute. Among those attending were <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Reps. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Akaka </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lancaster </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Leath </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> O </PERSON>' B. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Waihee </PERSON>; and other <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> military commanders. About 900 people attended a public service held simultaneously at the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> Memorial Visitor Center. Retired Rear Adm. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dybdal </PERSON>, who was a gunnery officer aboard the USS Helm at the time of the <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> attack, was the keynote speaker. He gave a personal account, paid tribute to those who died, and said <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> must remain strong, even with recent developments in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` We should support the movements toward democracy and freedom, but remember that the huge military strength of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is still there,'' he said. The National Park Service ceremony included prayers by the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Some <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> survivors scattered across the country attended commemorations without returning to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, for example, Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> told about 50 <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> survivors they were in `` the front line'' of the fight for freedom that is taking place in eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` You stand for peace and freedom, the peace and freedom that we all enjoy, that others strive for and that can never be taken for granted.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman charged Thursday that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration bungled the announcement of future cuts in defense spending by failing to spell out a military strategy. Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., said <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> directed the services to come up with ways to slash $ 180 billion from <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending during fiscal 1992 to fiscal 1994 but provided no policy guidance Without a strategy, the administration faces the likelihood of the defense budget being crafted by lawmakers concerned with parochial interests instead of by the administration, <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said. `` In the last couple of weeks the administration has fumbled the defense budget ball big time,'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Democrat said `` the budget exercise asked the services where they would cut. It did n't tell them what threats to assume, what roles to emphasize or what missions to minimize.'' Complicating the situation was <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s decision to discuss the cuts in published reports and television interviews, <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said. The cuts, according to the lawmaker, will come from unrealistic budget totals envisioned by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and in the long run will amount to substantial, but no massive, reductions. `` If we compare it to the five-year defense plan that they are now working with in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, a cut of $ 180 billion in 1992, 1993 and 1994 would mean a reduction of about 4.5 percent per year in each of those years. That's in real terms, after accounting for inflation,'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said. The problems stemming from the administration's handling of the issue will be worse if it falters in producing a strategy for the budget cuts, <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said. `` When your defense budget is not supported by a military strategy, it will be patched together with a pork strategy,'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said. `` Of course, even if you have a military strategy it is hard to fend off a pork strategy, but if you have no military strategy, you have no chance.'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said the administration faces allegations that it will be fashioning a strategy to fit the budget. Nevertheless, the administration must reopen the debate over Soviet military capabilities and intentions in a time of fast-moving events in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The administration then must outline a strategy to ensure that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> gets the most for its reduced defense dollars, <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 About 2,500 East Germans marched through the city center late Thursday shouting slogans against the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the country's once-feared secret police. Hundreds of the demonstators blew shrill, ear-piercing whistles and shouted for the secret police to stop meddling in citizens' affairs `` Imprison the Communists!'' the marchers demanded, referring to disgraced former leaders accused of having misused their offices or made off with state funds during four decades of Communist rule in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The rally, which started at <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s sprawling Alexanderplatz, followed the broad <LOCATION> Marx-Engels-Forum </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> and passed city hall, included demonstrators who hoisted signs calling for free elections next year. `` We Demand Quick Free Elections'' and `` The Communists Must Now Pay for the Mistakes of Misery,'' placards read. `` We Have Had Enough of Election Fraud.'' Former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> was forced to resign from his posts as party leader and president this week following accusations that he allowed approval of falsified April election results. Two demonstrators carried a sign showing a caricature of a man shredding polling records. Another sign denounced <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> and West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, who has offered a plan for German reunification. `` We need neither <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> nor <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> _ we'll only feel well when we govern ourselves,'' the sign read. There had been reports the demonstrators would march on the secret police headquarters in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, but the demonstrators never passed the building. About 200 demonstrators broke off from the main column at the Communist Party headquarters, where they shouted `` Come Out, Come Out, We Are Peaceful!'' Police presence as the march wound through the city was negligible. At one point, a policeman using the megaphone of a patrol car shouted, `` Attention, attention, this is the people's police, please use the sidewalks, you are disrupting traffic.'' The marchers ignored the order, booing and jeering. The police did nothing. People in a hotel along the route cheered on the marchers, who waved back. At about the same time, about 30 demonstrators from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> pushed their way to the front of the column of marchers and shouted anti-Nazi slogans. Part of the procession marched by the Dietrich-Bonhoeffer building, where negotiations between the Communists, other recognized political parties and opposition groups were under way. The marchers joined a chorus of calls there for free elections and other democratic reforms in a Communist nation under siege by its own people. About 90 minutes later, the marchers dispersed peacefully.

 Premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> resigned Thursday while still bargaining with the powerful opposition, which has told the Communists to form an acceptable government or face another general strike. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>, 63, announced his resignation at a meeting with non-Communist party officials about changes in the government, said <PERSON> Bohuslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Kucera </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He quoted <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> as saying a new, younger leader was needed to achieve a compromise. President <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> asked Deputy Premier <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Calfa </PERSON>, 43, to take over and continue searching for a solution, the official <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. <PERSON> Calfa </PERSON>, a Communist, has attended most of <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>'s recent meetings with opposition leaders, who rejected the Cabinet he formed last Sunday. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> had been expected to name a new government Friday that would involve some form of power sharing with the opposition, which in a few weeks has become strong enough to break the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s 41-year monopoly on power. The Civic Forum opposition movement and its Slovak counterpart, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Violence </ORGANIZATION>, have threatened a nationwide general strike for Monday if a satisfactory government has not been formed. Civic Forum leader <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, a playwright whose works have been banned in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, was asked whether he would accept the state presidency if it was offered. His reply: `` I have repeatedly said that my occupation is a writer and that I have no political ambitions. I do n't feel myself to be a professional politician, but have always put the public interest ahead of my own. `` And, if <PERSON> God </PERSON> help us, the situation should develop in such a way that the only service I could render my country would be to do this, then, of course, I would do it.'' <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> added later that no one was promoting his candidacy and he would accept it only if there was no other way out of the political crisis. Leaders of Civic Forum appeared on the main evening newscast with a list of names they gave <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> as possible Cabinet members only hours before he resigned. <PERSON> Zdenek </PERSON> <PERSON> Jicinsky </PERSON> said one proposal was that Slovak dissident <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnogursky </PERSON> be made first deputy premier and other deputy premiers be named from the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Carnogursky </PERSON> had been imprisoned since August and was freed 12 days ago. Civic Forum also proposed its current spokesman, <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dienstbier </PERSON>, as foreign minister and economist <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON>, a member, as finance minister. <PERSON> Jicinsky </PERSON> said <PERSON> Petr </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a worker at the <ORGANIZATION> CKD </ORGANIZATION> industrial plant in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and senior Civic Forum representative, was suggested as social affairs minister. There was no official reaction to the proposals. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>'s resignation was the latest capitulation to a pro-democracy movement that, in less than a month, has forced the Communists to relinquish their monopoly and dismiss leaders associated with the crushing of the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Spring reforms of 1968. The ruling Politburo stripped former party chief <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> party boss, of party membership Thursday, accusing them of `` grave political mistakes in resolving social tensions.'' Mentioned specifically was the brutal police action against peaceful protesters Nov. 17, which started the mass protest that brought the party down. Action against those responsible for the brutality has been a key opposition demand. Also at the Thursday meeting, the Politburo established a commission to `` investigate serious cases of abuse of office by certain party officials'' and said a special party congress would be moved up from January to Dec. 20-21. <PERSON> Kucera </PERSON> said his <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, formally allied with the Communists but increasingly independent, hoped to have at least two ministers in the new government. The Peoples' Party, another former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> ally now asserting independence, has said it wants <LOCATION> Calfa </LOCATION> to form a government with half the ministries run by people who have no aparty affiliation. It wants the other 50 percent divided among the Communists, itself, the Socialists and two small officially recognized parties in <LOCATION> Slovakia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> left halfway through the two-hour meeting with other parties Thrusday, striding grimly toward his official sedan in silence. He became premier in October 1988, and said last week that <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders often had frustrated his plans for reform. Party chief <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> and several members of the ruling Politburo were present at the meeting in which <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> resigned. In a televised address Wednesday, <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> had said he would quit if the opposition did not stop presenting `` ultimatums.'' On Thursday, opposition leaders rejected charges that it had put <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> under pressure to change the Communist-dominated Cabinet sworn in last Sunday, which they rejected because it included only five non-Communists. They want a new interim government to build the legal basis for parliamentary democracy and hold free elections by July. On Monday, hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s two largest cities, against <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>'s new Cabinet. He reopened negotations with the opposition Tuesday.

 The wild pig population feeding on garbage at the <LOCATION> Seminole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> landfill had multiplied to about 1,500, and the county decided it was time to do something. Enter <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON>, 23-year-old professional trapper. He pays the county $ 52 apiece to round up the hogs and truck them away to sell to a slaughter house. `` People think catching hogs is fun, but it's a job,'' <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON> said Tuesday after several days of trapping and muscling squealing hogs _ which weighed up to 350 pounds _ into a truck. <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON> arrived at the 1,200-acre landfill early Saturday with three helpers and began their routine: Set traps by day, sleep in their vehicles at night while the hogs get trapped, and the next day haul the hogs to <LOCATION> Myakka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, a three-hour drive. It's tough work, he said. `` They get mean. They ai n't no pets, you know. They'll catch you if you let them,'' <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Marcos Took Fifth Amendment When Asked About Alleged Slush Fund</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RORY MARSHALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a videotape played Thursday, former <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked about a slush fund allegedly used to pay for the murders of two anti-Marcos activists in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. The deposition from the late Philippine ruler was played in a wrongful-death lawsuit filed by the families of <PERSON> Silme </PERSON> <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Viernes </PERSON>, who were shot in offices of the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cannery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> here in June 1981. Three men were convicted of the murders on the theory that the victims were working to eliminate gang influence on work assignments and gambling in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> fish canneries. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> lawsuit, however, claims the murder plot actually was hatched in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> because of <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON>'s and Viernes' anti-Marcos activism The plaintiffs claim $ 15,000 was paid for the murders from an intelligence slush fund that was administered by a company, the <ORGANIZATION> Mabuhay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, which was run by Dr. <PERSON> Leonilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Malabed </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has admitted <PERSON> Malabed </PERSON> was a friend, but invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination on all questions regarding intelligence funding and the Mabuhay company. He gave his deposition during two sessions in 1986 and 1987, after he fled to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> following the February 1986 overthrow of his government. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> died last September. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government and others are defendants in the suit, which seeks $ 30 million in damages. The questions <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> would not answer were: _ Whether the <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> was used to channel money to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for intelligence operations in the late 1970s and 1980s _ Whether he authorized the use of up to $ 1 million in PNB money to create the <ORGANIZATION> Mabuhay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ Whether PNB money went to <ORGANIZATION> Mabuhay </ORGANIZATION> and was used `` to conduct acts of physical violence against the anti-Marcos opposition ... including and up to the use of murder, political assassination and summary execution _ Whether he was aware of <PERSON> Malabed </PERSON>'s effort to buy a radio station, the purpose for which <ORGANIZATION> Mabuhay </ORGANIZATION> allegedly was established <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> also refused to answer when asked directly whether <ORGANIZATION> Mabuhay </ORGANIZATION> was used as an `` intelligence slush fund'' that provided $ 15,000 on May 17, 1981, for the <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> and Viernes murders. That exchange was disallowed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothstein </PERSON> and edited out of the video, but included in the full transcript of the deposition. Among the key documents in the trial is one that plaintiffs claim is an Mabuhay account sheet for the slush fund. Under a heading for `` security projects'' is a May 17 entry for $ 15,000. Plaintiffs claim former cannery-union president <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Baruso </PERSON>, whose gun was used in the killings, was in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> on that date to pick up the money. <PERSON> Baruso </PERSON>, who was never criminally charged in the murders, also invoked the Fifth Amendment 75 times during his testimony earlier in the lawsuit trial. In testimony shown Wednesday for a 1986 deposition session, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> admitted four Philippine intelligence agencies operated in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during his martial-law regime, but he denied they would have used strong-arm tactics. He said he did n't become concerned about anti-Marcos opposition in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> until about 1984.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday took a parlimentary end run around the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to install a new Census director whose nomination had been languishing. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced, in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> for several speaking engagements, said he would give <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Everitt </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrant </PERSON> a `` recess appointment.''

 Federal regulators asked a judge Thursday to dismiss a suit against them by the former owner of <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, saying they can show <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> millionaire <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was operating the thrift in violation of the law. Deals that the hearing is focusing on are `` literally just the tip of the iceberg,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thrift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Sporkin </PERSON>. Under an arrangement approved by attorneys for both sides, a sample of four deals _ two land transactions, a tax-sharing arrangement between <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and its holding company and a deal involving stock _ will occupy the two days of hearings that began Thursday. `` I assume you picked the worst ones,'' <PERSON> Sporkin </PERSON>, a former chief enforcement officer for the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said to <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>. The judge ordered the hearing on the government's motion to dismiss <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'s suit in what regulators say will end up as the costliest S & amp; L collapse in history Last May, a month after regulators seized <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, thrift, he filed the suit seeking to nullify the government's action. Regulators contended the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L had lost between $ 1 billion and $ 2.5 billion in federally insured deposits through fraud, risky investments and sham real estate transactions. The government has summoned <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> to appear as a witness. The target of a federal grand jury investigation in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and refused to answer questions in a subpoenaed appearance last month before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. In his suit, <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> and his attorneys allege that <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> was being operated soundly, met federal capital requirements and was making a profit, and that its takeover by the government was `` capricious and arbitrary.'' Before hearing testimony, <PERSON> Sporkin </PERSON> denied efforts by <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'s attorneys to quash as evidence four letters from one of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s attorneys prior to the takeover last April <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> attorney representing <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, said allowing the government to use the letters would violate his client's attorney-client privilege. `` We should not be forced to have our own lawyers used against us,'' he said. However, attorneys for the thrift regulators said the letters effectively became government property once the government seized <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sporkin </PERSON> granted <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'s request for government records dating back to 1985 on tax-sharing agreements between hundreds of thrifts around the country and their holding companies. A key element of the government's case is its contention that <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and its holding company, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, abused a tax-sharing agreement to effectively siphon off nearly $ 95 million in federally insured deposits. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> is chairman of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, which filed for a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization one day before the government placed <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> into conservatorship. Government regulators in 1986 had approved the tax-sharing arrangement, under which American was supposed to collect taxes from <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and forward the money to the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> fraudulently misused the accord to effectively allow the holding company to use the tax collections as a no-interest loan from <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>. Federal thrift regulations prohibit savings and loan institutions from lending money to their holding companies. In a related development, Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>'s complaint about a leak of information that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was investigating a voter registration project operated by his son, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, was referred to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Professional Responsiblity. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> told reporters he referred the matter to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s internal investigations office. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., is one of five senators who intervened on <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'s behalf with federal regulators The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is investigating whether whether <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> and the other senators violated any laws by taking campaign donations from <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> and lobbying federal regulators.

<TEXT>
 Bells tolled, thousands wept in the graveyards and plaintive chants filled the streets Thursday as <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> marked the first anniversary of the earthquake that killed 25,000 of its people. In this mountain city, officials stopped the town clock forever at 11:41, the minute disaster struck, and held a moment of silence. Only muffled sobs broke the stillness. `` If only it could all have been a dream, and we could wake up and have everyone here again,'' Armenian poet <PERSON> Maro </PERSON> <PERSON> Marzarian </PERSON> told a crowd of several hundred gathered to dedicate a memorial to <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>'s thousands of dead. In a snowy cemetery just outside of town, women sobbed at the gravesites, some of them caressing photographs etched on the tombstones and men stood stony eyed and silent. Many graves held unidentified corpses, with markers reading only `` 238, woman'' or `` 453, child.'' `` Your soul hurts so much you just ca n't express it,'' said <PERSON> Lilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepanian </PERSON>, 25, whose brother, <PERSON> Zillik </PERSON>, and his family were crushed to death in their <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> apartment. `` You remember that on this day, at this time, they were already gone,'' she said. `` At this time one year ago I was standing by our house, only it was n't a house any more. She said <PERSON> Zillik </PERSON>'s 3-year-old daughter could be heard crying from the ruins of the house but rescuers could not get to her in time. <PERSON> Stepanian </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Rima </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Zillik </PERSON>'s wife had been due to give birth to a second child three weeks later. `` And the people left alive have such a hard time,'' <PERSON> Lilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepanian </PERSON> said. She and her mother moved to Armenian capital of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> until <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> housing could be built for them _ which they do n't expect any time soon. The earthquake measuring 6.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale killed at least 25,000 people, left 20,000 missing and destroyed the homes of 500,000 more. In the nearby village of <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>, where the quake destroyed virtually every house, residents dedicated a new church of galvanized steel. Standing above a hillside crowded with graves, it shone in the sun under Thursday's bright blue sky. Armenians stopped work Thursday to honor the dead, and Armenian TV broadcast a program on earthquake damage and reconstruction. After the quake rocked <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> with such devastating force, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> opened its borders to foreign assistance for the first time, accepting the help of thousands of experts, including rescue teams, doctors and construction specialists. More than a half-billion dollars in assistance poured into the disaster area from overseas, altering the course of East-West relations as generosity and mercy overcame years of Soviet propaganda depicting Westerners as greedy and hate-filled. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said Thursday that foreign assistance as of mid-October totaled $ 586 million. The most generous donors were <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> with $ 95 million; <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> with $ 84.5 million; the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with $ 42 million; <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> with $ 38 million; <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> with $ 34.5 million; <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> with $ 30 million; and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> with $ 28 million.

 President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said Friday he would not order an independent inquiry into allegations of police death squads because justice officials could do the job faster and just as well. Several police officers, serving and retired, will be investigated and five have requested suspension from duty until investigations or legal proceedings are completed, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> and <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>, the law and order minister, said in statements released at 12:01 a.m. Justice Minister <PERSON> Kobie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coetsee </PERSON> said two former security policemen whose allegations prompted the inquiry would be prosecuted. One awaits execution for a non-political murder and the other has fled the country. `` The government has full confidence that the tried and respected prosecution mechanisms of the state will be sufficient to bring the accused before the court, impartially and objectively,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> in response to demands that the investigation be conducted outside the law enforcement establishment. `` A judicial inquiry can take months, if not years, to reach its final conclusions,'' he said. `` In the meanwhile, a climate of suspicion and distrust could develop, something the country can ill afford at this stage in its history.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s national police have been criticized for failing to solve dozens of killings of anti-government activists since 1978. Anti-apartheid leaders say many people believe security personnel help plan, participate in, or cover up such actions. Three former security policemen have said in recent newspaper interviews or sworn affidavits that they participated in death squad operations on orders of superiors, many of whom still occupy high positions in the police. The former policemen, two black and one white, said they were involved in bombings, arson, kidnapping, robbery and murder in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and neighboring countries. One, Almond Nofomela, is awaiting execution. The others have fled, but one is reported held by authorities in <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>'s statement about what would be investigated mentioned only Nofomela's allegations. He said `` a team of senior detectives'' would work with the attorneys general of <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Transvaal </LOCATION> provinces. The South African Council of Churches demanded access Thursday to camps where police say former <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas are held when they agree to join the police. One former policemen who fled, ex-Capt. <PERSON> Dirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Coetzee </PERSON>, said the death squads recruited such former guerrillas. Police identified five Afrikaner men Thursday who were arrested in connection with an alleged far-right group suspected of planning attacks on anti-apartheid activists. The men, all from the <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> area, range in age from 24 to 41, and were arrested Tuesday. Police say the men are believed to be part of a group that broke with the neo-Nazi <ORGANIZATION> Afrikaner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. A report in the Citizen newspaper said police were investigating the possibility that extremists had murdered black civilians as practice for future attacks on political targets. It said all five men were former members of the paramilitary bodyguard that protected <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> TerreBlanche </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Afrikaner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, and he was on a `` hit list'' found when they were arrested. Police are said to be investigating possible connections between the five men and two other cases. In one, two former policemen are held in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> for questioning about the assassinations of university academic <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> and Namibian lawyer <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubowski </PERSON>. In the other, three men escaped this week from police custody while being transported from a Namibian court, where they faced murder charges for a grenade attack on an office of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers monitoring the territory's transition to independence.

<HEAD>Transportation Secretary Promises `Reasonable' Approach To Drug Testing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> assured private transportation operators Thursday that his department will be `` reasonable and understanding'' in enforcing drug testing rules that take effect this month. `` You do n't have to be worried during the implementation stage that enforcers will show up at your doorstep with subpoenas,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> told an industry seminar on the new program. Drug testing programs, including random testing, will have to go into effect for mariners and transit and aviation workers this month. Testing for railroad workers starts in January and for pipeline workers in April. A federal court injunction has stalled random and some post-accident testing in the trucking industry. Companies with fewer than 50 employees will have another year to begin testing programs. Twenty-two court challenges have been filed against the program by various transportation groups, but <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said it will take effect on schedule except where courts intervene. `` While we want the rules enforced and expect them to be implemented, we understand it will be an evolutionary process,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said. `` Rest assured, we will be reasonable and understanding.'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said safety-related jobs must be drug-free for the nation's transportation systems to remain safe. The department eventually expects about half of the nation's 4 million transportation employees to be tested at least once a year both as a means of detecting drug use and as a deterent. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> noted that 25,349 random drug tests conducted on department employees resulted in only 141 positive tests, a rate of about 0.5 percent. But he told reporters earlier this week that he expects the tests to show an `` alarming amount of drug usage'' in mass transit and other private transportation industries.

 Police and community leaders expected little violent reaction Thursday to the guilty verdicts against a police officer in the killing of two black men, but police stayed on alert in the ethnically tense city. Police had made extraordinary preparations in case an inocent verdict in the trial of Hispanic officer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> set off violence in black neighborhoods. Instead, the verdict left bitterness among some Hispanics. `` We'll maintain a high visibility tonight and possibly downscale our activities tomorrow,'' Police Chief <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. The police department put all 1,100 officers on call, bought 700 gas masks and arranged for two armored personnel carriers to be available for riot duty. The city has been wracked by riots four times this decade, most recently in January when <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>'s fatal shooting of a black motorcyclist triggered three days of violence in the week before <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> held the Super Bowl. The motorcyclist's passenger also died. Near the shooting site in the impoverished, mostly black <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> section, some 100 blacks went ahead with a march Thursday despite the verdict. But they said the event was turned from a protest to a celebration. `` The verdict means relief, but there's still an element in the police department that thinks justice lies at the end of your arm,'' said march organizer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Umoja </PERSON> <PERSON> Imani </PERSON>. `` Everyone has been following this from day one,'' said participant <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, 22, who lives in an apartment building across the street from the shooting site. `` When the verdict was announced, everyone was relieved and very happy.'' Some marchers criticized police officials' decision to post riot-ready units in black neighborhoods and ignore mostly Hispanic areas. Among Hispanics, who outnumber <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> blacks more than 2-to-1, the mood seemed mostly concerned but not hostile. `` Yes, there will be people in the Hispanic community that will think it's unfair, but that has to be settled,'' said <PERSON> Tere </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavalda </PERSON> of the Spanish-American League Against Discrimination. `` It's unfortunate the case turned out to be a black against Hispanic issue We have to put that to rest.'' Mayor <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> said he received nearly a dozen telephone calls from people angered by the verdict, but there was no indication of violence. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON>, who last summer was denounced by some fellow Cuban-Americans for supporting a black woman over a Cuban for a city commission seat, said there was no way of knowing if the verdict would raise tensions between blacks and Hispanics. `` I do n't think the Hispanic community is going to respond in any monolithic way,'' <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON>, who took office in 1985 with a promise to improve <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s inner-city neighborhoods, hoped the verdict might ease some of the alienation among blacks there who feel the justice system is against them. `` There has been a succession of cases that led to outcomes that have not been successful to the black community,'' <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> said. `` This was at least a departure from a trend.'' Community leaders who had been ready to go into the streets to talk against violence said they would try to ease any ethnic reactions by Hispanics. `` We definitely have not reached Utopia,'' said <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Community Relations Board. `` We're not going to drop everything. We were focusing on a not guilty verdict -LRB- and black reaction -RRB- and now the emphasis shifts on the Hispanic group.'' At Spanish-language radio station <ORGANIZATION> WQBA </ORGANIZATION>, caller were shocked and angry, said <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Checa </PERSON>, a technical director. `` Mostly, they feel the judgment was done for the black community,'' <PERSON> Checa </PERSON> said. Some police advocates predicted the verdict would harm efforts to recruit for <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s police force. `` I hope this wo n't discourage people from being police officers, but that's my concern. Being a cop in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> is tough enough,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Nevel </PERSON>, attorney for a police group that supports stronger penalties for criminals and also president of <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fraternal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 The Communist Party got together with the opposition Thursday, after 40 years of ruling <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> with Stalinist orthodoxy, and they agreed to rewrite the constitution and hold free elections in May. The first talks between party and opposition delegations were held after publication of the new Communist program, and produced agreement to recommend that <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> schedule elections May 6. They also agreed on the need for a new constitution, but no details were released. About 2,500 people marched to the site of the talks in a <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> building and chanted, `` Free elections! Free elections!'' Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwanitz </PERSON>, chief of state security, said angry citizens had stormed secret police facilities in four cities, inflicting `` numerous slight injuries to our colleagues.'' He said the situation was at `` the threshold of escalation,'' and aggressive acts against his forces could `` have unforeseeable consequences for the country.'' The government has warned against growing violence, but few cases have been documented. Opposition leaders in <LOCATION> Suhl </LOCATION> claimed police dispersed angry citizens with tear gas. In an interview on state television, Communist Premier <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> appealed for calm while sympathizing with people angered by reports of ousted officials thwarting investigations of alleged corruption. Mayor <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Berghofer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>, representing the Communists at the talks, joined other officials in calling on citizens to act responsibly. `` I understand the motivation, but such a process can get out of control,'' he said. <PERSON> Berghofer </PERSON> expressed concern about short, politically motivated strikes occurring at state enterprises. The West German newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying there was a `` potential for violence on both sides.'' East German news media reported riots in some prisons by inmates demanding amnesty. <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON>, chief aide to Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, spoke to reporters in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> of `` tendencies toward increasing aggression'' in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hans-Jochen </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, leader of the opposition Social Democrats, expressed similar concern. In what may have been intended as a preventative measure, the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> secret police force invited activists from several pro-democracy groups for a tour of their headquarters and talks with security officials. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has undergone a virtual revolution in less than two months, ousting the old leaders, then the replacements, and opening its borders. Some former leaders have been charged with corruption. As in the the rest of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> at a time of rapid change, the future political course is unclear. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> opens an emergency congress Friday to revamp its structure and shed the last vestiges o Stalinism. <PERSON> Markus </PERSON> <PERSON> Meckel </PERSON>, a spokesman for the newly formed <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters Thursday the Communists planned to change their name to the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, as the Hungarians did in October. In its new program, published Thursday by the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION>, the party calls for `` alternative democratic socialism'' and accepts blame for the current political and economic turmoil. It advocates closer cooperation with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, but warns against reunification as a threat to stability. `` We support free and secret elections as early as possible, at a time to be set jointly by all political forces,'' the program says, but does not suggest an election date. All `` newly formed democratic political movements and forces'' work together until the elections, the program says, in a reference to New Forum and other opposition movements that have sprung up in recent weeks. Since the leadership resigned en masse on Sunday, the party has been guided by a committee of 25 reformers, who devised the new program. Many topics raised at the first party-opposition meeting Thursday also are likely to be addressed at the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> congress. <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> had been expected attend the talks with 13 other parties and social groups. His absence may indicate reluctance to take a prominent role in party affairs, since <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> has more popular support than other ranking party members. Long debates over who could take part and what would be on the agenda left little time for negotiating at the session. <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON>, the country's interim president, urged the gathering to propose a new voting law and suggested May or June for free elections. <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON>, a non-Communist who leads the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was named president Wednesday to replace <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>. Groups represented in the forum, including a half-dozen pro-reform groups that still lack official recognition, agreed in advance that it had no power to make national policy but could make proposals to the legislature. Pro-democracy rallies that swelled to hundreds of thousands after the Oct. 7 celebration of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s 40th year forced <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> to step down as party chief Oct. 18. He was replaced by <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, a long-time associate who in turn was hounded into resignation Sunday. Successes scored by pro-democracy activists have emboldened many citizen organizations pressing for further change. New committees have been formed to make sure authorities prevent those accused of corruption from absconding with incriminating evidence or state property. Citizens have occupied state security facilities in at least six cities, and authorities claimed Wednesday there were indications of assaults being planned on military facilities. Activists in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, Gera, <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cottbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Suhl </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Rostock </PERSON> have taken over secret police facilities, angered by reports that some officials suspected of graft and corruption have destroyed files or made off with valuables.

<TEXT>
 The Presidential Guard used tear gas and clubs to disperse about 1,000 students Thursday during the largest protest yet against European mercenaries who seized control of this island nation. Witnesses said several of the high-school students were beaten. The violence came as <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> cut off its $ 18 million in annual aid to the Comoros, off the east coast of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Diplomatic sources said the assistance would not be resumed until the head of the new ruling group, French mercenary <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Denard </PERSON>, leaves the island. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, another large donor to this impoverished nation with a population of about 430,000, took the same action Monday. It also cut off support for the Presidential Guard. President <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Abderrahmane </PERSON> died Nov. 26 in an attack blamed by diplomatic sources on <PERSON> Denard </PERSON>, commander of the 500-member Presidential Guard. That force disarmed the regular army and now controls the four-island archipelago between <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and the island of <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>. The students shouted `` The mercenaries must go!'' and `` <PERSON> Denard </PERSON> is an assassin!'' as they marched from the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> to the beachfront Thursday morning. They were confronted there by members of the guard, which is led by about 30 French and Belgian mercenaries. The guardsmen, supported by jeeps equipped with heavy machine guns, drove through the capital in the biggest show of force since <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> was killed. <PERSON> Denard </PERSON> has denied involvement in the assassination, but sources said Thursday the two men had quarreled recently over several issues, including funding of the Presidential Guard. Many students dashed into the water when the guardsmen arrived, and others fled through side streets. Most later regrouped at the Ministry of the Interior in the city center, where dozens of guardsmen launched tear-gas grenades and charged with clubs. Youths forced a suspected spy for the Presidential Guard from his civilian car, then overturned the vehicle and burned it on one of the main streets of <LOCATION> Moroni </LOCATION>, the capital. Witnesses said several students were clubbed or otherwise beaten, but there was no official injury toll. Guardsmen patrolled working-class areas of the city throughout the day, dispersing smaller gatherings with tear gas and clubs, the witnesses said. Throughout the day, hundreds of young men jeered and shouted at Guard vehicles as they sped through the capital and outlying villages. `` The people have always opposed the mercenaries, but they were silent until the president was killed,'' said <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Moroni </LOCATION> resident. `` Now the people are angry and say the mercenaries must leave.'' Several photographers and reporters had their film and notebooks seized as they covered the morning demonstration. Ten journalists were later ordered to leave the islands by Thursday evening, and five other journalists were told to remain in their hotel. The French <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the suspended aid includes direct assistance, as well as 150 technical and 13 military advisers. The islands gained independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1975. <PERSON> Denard </PERSON>, 60, ousted and later returned <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> to the presidency in coups during the 1970s. Although <PERSON> Denard </PERSON> held no official title, he maintained strong influence in security and political matters.

The capital's half-dozen dailies all ran banner headlines about Wednesday's 1,100-pound dynamite bomb explosion that destroyed a block of downtown <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, killing 52 people and wounding about 1,000. The blast outside federal investigative police headquarters came one day after a government report blamed terrorists for the Nov. 27 explosion of a Colombian jet that killed all 107 people aboard. `` Drug Traffickers Turn <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiempo </PERSON>'s headline <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiempo </PERSON> and <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Espectador </PERSON> said the situation was so grave President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> should ask all parties to forget their differences and form a common front against traffickers. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Espectador </PERSON> said the crisis extends beyond the traffickers' terrorist campaign to encompass a political system on the verge of collapse <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> told the nation late Wednesday traffickers were endangering the country's democracy, but would fail. `` We are fighting and will continue to fight. The war is against all <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, against democracy,'' he said in a speech transmitted by satellite from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where he is on a state visit. Barco is cutting his visit short by one day and returning to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> Friday night. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on Thursday, the president promised to take swift, stern action against cocaine cartels and the terrorists. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> cited the drug violence Thursday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> when he said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` ought to think carefully about a visit to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> under these circumstances.'' He commented after meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the White House on the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> summit. White House advance teams have scouted <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s northern coastal city of <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION> as a possible site for the upcoming drug summit <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has agreed to attend with leaders of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. Meanwhile a bomb exploded Thursday on a road in <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION>, killing two policemen in a car, radio reports said. Pamphlets left at the site, however, indicated the attack was the work of the leftist guerrilla <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The immediate threat to this <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nation's stability is traffickers' insistence that the people be allowed to vote on the administration's extradition policy. The Extraditables, a group linked to the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel, took responsibility for the Wednesday bomb hours after the devastating explosion. It earlier pledged in a communique to keep up the terrorist campaign until the extradition referendum is approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> passed a bill Tuesday night calling for such a referendum and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is to vote on the measure before its current session ends on Dec. 15. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has long been the butt of jokes by Colombians as being corrupt and receiving payments from drug dealers. In an editorial headlined `` Faced with Crime, Terror and Moral Corruption,'' <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Espectador </PERSON> said the country's constitutional system no longer exists because it has been so damaged by traffickers' influence. Traffickers bombed <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 2 as part of a terror campaign to try to pressure the government into ending extradition. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> suggested in his speech that drug barons were intimidating legislators into following their demands. `` It is unacceptable from every point of view that drug traffickers are trying to subdue our legislators so that they make a decision that will only bring more death and destruction,'' he said. His administration has sent nine Colombian drug suspects to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> under a tough extradition policy, part of an anti-narcotics war decreed last August after traffickers assassinated a leading presidential candidate.

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> appeals court has upheld a federal judge's 1987 ruling that <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> must pay $ 215,000 in damages and grant tenure to a female professor who sued the university for sex discrimination The case was believed to be the first time a woman suing under the federal anti-discrimination law was reinstated with full tenure by an appeals court. <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Prewitt </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 41, was a member of <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION>'s English Department from 1974 until she was denied tenure in 1981. At one point, university president <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Silber </PERSON> termed the department `` a damn matriarchy'' although only only six out of 20 members of the department at the time were female, according to court testimony. In a 68-page decision, the <ORGANIZATION> 1st </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> unanimously agreed with a jury verdict and subsequent judgment by Judge <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> after a three-week trial in July 1987. The ruling was issued Dec. 1 but <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s attorney said she chose not to publicize it until Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cashman </PERSON> said the university will ask the court for a rehearing. `` <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> does not discriminate against anyone,'' <PERSON> Cashman </PERSON> said in a prepared statement. `` This case involves issues of academic freedom. We believe that it is wrong for courts to substitute their opinions or the opinions of the jury for the scholarly judgment of the university in determining who shall teach.'' <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION>'s official reason for not granting tenure was <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s alleged `` lack of academic excellence.'' But <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was unanimously recommended for tenure by her BU colleagues both inside and outside the department, according to the appellate decision. `` I think it's going to be a real shot in the arm for women as well as minorities,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, an attorney on the faculty at <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the author of `` Academics in Court.'' `` It's extremely difficult to win these cases,'' she said. `` Most times the judge accepts the universities' arguments.'' The decision, written by Chief Judge <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, touched on remarks made by <PERSON> Silber </PERSON> in tenure reviews of other female faculty members. According to the ruling, <PERSON> Silber </PERSON> told one female professor that a person with her credentials would do well `` and anyway ... your husband is a parachute, so why are you worried?'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> wrote that `` -LRB- <PERSON> Silber </PERSON>'s -RRB- comments reflected a patronizing attitude toward women.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who spent 10 years fighting her case, called the decision `` a victory for all of us.'' `` I am only one among many women at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and in the academy at large who have been held to a higher standard than male colleagues,'' she said in a prepared statement Thursday. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Franke </PERSON>, an attorney with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professors </ORGANIZATION> who filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the appellate court, said the ruling `` means there's a powerful remedy through the courts now for sex discrimination.'' <PERSON> Franke </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> both said the appeals decision was the first to their knowledge in which a professor's full tenure was reinstated under the anti-discrimination law.

 Sixteen savings and loans were permitted to sell $ 3 billion in uninsured debt to their customers, the same practice that cost many depositors at <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> their life savings, thrift regulators said Thursday. Despite the Lincoln debacle, the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thrift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION> this year allowed seven S & amp; Ls to begin selling debt to retail customers and another nine institutions to continue sales approved earlier, according to a two-page summary released by the office. Such sales are attracting heavy scrutiny because some 22,000 investors, many of them elderly pensioners and widows, lost an estimated $ 250 million by purchasing subordinated debt in <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the parent company of the <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, Calif.-based <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, in 1987 and 1988. In sometimes tearful testimony, <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> customers told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last month they were misled into believing the debt certificates were federally insured. The Lincoln debt was sold in the branch offices of the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L and offered in amounts as small as $ 1,000, a feature that appealed to unsophisticated investors. The thrift office said the approved debt sales, in addition to <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, totaled $ 3.017 billion. In some instances denominations as low as $ 1,000 were offered. Thrift office rules required that S & amp; Ls offering debt meet capital standards at the time of the approval. However, according to <ORGANIZATION> Sheshunoff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Austin </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, two of the 16 S & amp; Ls as of June 30 had no tangible capital. They are <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assocation </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Centrust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Two others fall short of new standards effective Thursday which require S & amp; Ls to hold capital amounting to 1.5 percent of their assets, the firm said. They are <ORGANIZATION> Cenlar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> TCF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Centrust </ORGANIZATION> was allowed to offer $ 50 million in notes in minimum denominations of $ 2,000, while <PERSON> Cenlar </PERSON> was permitted $ 20 million in $ 1,000 denominations. <ORGANIZATION> TCF </ORGANIZATION> and Security first sold their debt in minimums of $ 10,000. However, not all of the debt sales are suspect. <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheshunoff </PERSON>, the owner of the information firm, said the $ 1 billion offering in $ 100,000 minimums by <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, considered one of the best S & amp; Ls in the nation, is probably an excellent investment. <PERSON> Sheshunoff </PERSON> said S & amp; Ls should be permitted to offer their debt without going through an underwriter, but he said they should screen out unsophisticated buyers by offering the debt in large denominations and should clearly disclose that the debt is uninsured. The release of the information by the thrift office, which followed a story on the subject in Thursday editions of The Washington Post, drew criticism of the sales from a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Banking subcommittee chairman. Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the financial institutions panel, called on Wall in a letter to revoke his agency's permission for the debt sales `` There is no need for me to recite the damage that this kind of sale caused to thousands of purchasers in the Lincoln ... situation,'' <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> wrote. Wall, in a talk to the Association of Government Accountants, said his agency was obligated to approve the debt sales under existing laws and rules. `` There was no regulation that had been promulgated to prohibit it. So we could not have disapproved it other than for good and other kinds of economic reasons,'' he said. The thrift agency is planning within weeks to adopt regulations sharply limiting future subordinated debt sales by <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls because `` we've learned from our experiences,'' <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said. Bills restricting the sale of <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L debt have been introduced in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> by Reps. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillen </PERSON>, D-Md.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, who only a month ago was reviled by the official press, said Thursday he would accept the presidency if necessary to help resolve the country's crisis. Appearing at a crowded news conference in the <LOCATION> Laterna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Magika </LOCATION> theater, the playwright seemed tired but elated by his speedy transfer from the dramatic to the political stage. Thousands of supporters of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s Civic Forum opposition movement, which <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> heads, are now sporting Hungarian-made buttons declaring `` Havel for President.'' With characteristic humor, <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> told reporters, `` I do n't wear that badge.'' He said he had nothing to do with its manufacture because `` my connections do not extend as far as <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>.'' A shy man, he has repeatedly declined offers to seek political office. But, when asked Thursday if he would accept the presidency if offered, he said he would do so under certain circumstances. `` I have repeatedly said that my occupation is a writer and that I have no political ambitions. I do n't feel myself to be a professional politician but have always put the public interest ahead of my own. `` And, if <PERSON> God </PERSON> help us, the situation should develop in such a way that the only service I could render my country would be to do this, then, of course, I would do it,'' <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> said. He stressed that there is no organized group promoting his candidacy. `` The more democratic and more normal the condition in our country, the less my role will be,'' the mustachioed writer said. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> has avoided interviews the past two hectic weeks during a mass pro-democracy movement that forced the Communists to relinquish their 41-year monopoly on power, ousted most hard-line leaders and paved the way for a coalition government that could restore democracy. With characteristic caution Thursday, he ducked a question about when he began to believe that the opposition could triumph. `` We have a saying in Czech, ` You should not praise the day before the evening,''' <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> said, smiling. As a founding member of Charter 77, eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s oldest human rights movement, <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> has spent most of the last 13 years under police surveillance and served 4 -LCB- years in jail for his outspoken criticism of what he calls `` totalitarian Communism.'' Asked what he had learned from those years, <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> echoed the creed of one of his best-known essays chronicling the moral deformations of Stalinism, `` Living In Truth.'' `` I have learned that when a person behaves in accordance with his conscience, and when he tries to speak the truth, behave as a citizen even when citizenship as such is degraded. It may not lead to anything _ but it might,'' he said quietly.

 Angolan rebels Thursday objected to a summit of eight African leaders scheduled to discuss plans for ending the southwest African nation's 14-year civil war. `` The mediation of endless and inconclusive summits by the group of eight has already proved disastrous to the process of peace in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>,'' the rebels said in a statement distributed in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>. It was signed by rebel leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, leader of the U.S.-backed <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebels. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s state news agency, <ORGANIZATION> ANGOP </ORGANIZATION>, reported Tuesday that the government would present its latest cease-fire plan to leaders from <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tome </LOCATION> e Principe, <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> later this month at their fifth summit on Angolan peace prospects.

<TEXT>
 In a defeat for organized labor, a federal judge ruled Thursday in favor of a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> regulation that allows working at home in five apparel-related industries. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s ruling rescinds a ban on home work in the five industries. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> regulation represents a `` reasoned'' approach requiring firms seeking to institute home work to come forward and seek certification from the government. They also would be subjected to monitoring by department inspectors. The International Ladies Garment Workers' union and two other unions sued the secretary of labor last January, saying tens of thousands of workers, mostly immigrant women, would be exploited by the rule and that the working standards of other workers would be threatened. The five industries affected by the department rule are those making gloves and mittens, handkerchiefs, buttons and buckles, some types of jewelry and embroideries. The department this past year held several public hearings on its proposed rule and has yet to issue a final version. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said the concerns of labor unions about workers being exploited by home work `` are no doubt valid.'' A ban on home work in seven industries _ including the five affected by the department rule _ was adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in the early 1940s. Home workers in those industries are normally paid by piece rate rather than hourly wages. `` The evidence is strong that the conditions present in the 1940s regarding the exploitation of home workers have not disappeared,'' said <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>. But the judge said the `` sole issue'' before the court is whether the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` provided a reasoned basis'' for concluding that a certification system is a better means of enforcing federal labor law than a total home work ban. He said the department formulated the rule after nearly a decade of analysis. `` The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> is deeply disappointed'' by the court decision, said <PERSON> Lorrie </PERSON> <PERSON> McHugh </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the 14.1-million-member labor federation. `` Removing the ban on home work opens up new doors to exploitation of workers, doors that were closed over 40 years ago because abuse ran rampant.'' Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said in a statement she was most pleased. The department's rule, she said, `` is a step in the right direction toward reconciling some of the demands of work and family.'' The labor unions contend the rule contains inadequate safeguards to prevent violations of laws governing minimum wage, child labor, maximum work hours, workplace safety and other issues. The rule `` may well encourage home workers and their employers to come forward and comply'' with the Fair Labor Standards Act, said the judge. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said states that disagree with the department's conclusion remain free to ban home work in those industries The unions have pointed to evidence that the department has failed to vigorously enforce the total home work ban. The department attributes that to scarce resources and maintains that a certification system would be superior to a total home work ban. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> questioned the possible motives of both sides, saying that the department's decision to lift the ban may be motivated by `` its sympathy for certain constituences or a certain political philosophy.'' He said the unions may be motivated by concerns of its members about the `` threat of economic competition from home workers and firms employing them.'' But <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said his role is `` not to referee this dispute or to speculate on how it has shaded'' the debate between the unions and the government.

 The government on Thursday allowed for the possibility of a reunified <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, but said such a state must be formed gradually and respect <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s borders. In the Solidarity government's first definitive statement on the issue, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Krzysztof </PERSON> <PERSON> Skubiszewski </PERSON> told Parliament the two German states could be joined as part of the process of uniting <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He said German reunification `` can not go ahead'' of the reunification of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` A reunited <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will not be created tomorrow or the day after tomorrow,'' <PERSON> Skubiszewski </PERSON> said. `` Fears and concerns appearing every now and then, including in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, are unjustified, although alertness is recommended.'' Asked about German reunification at a news conference in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, Solidarity labor leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he prefers `` no political changes in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but there should be all kinds of economic integrations.'' Western <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries have agreed to form an economic union by the end of 1992. Sweeping democratic reforms have taken hold in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in the past several weeks under the pressure of mass protests, spurring talk of reuniting the two German states divided at the end of World War II. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has proposed a plan for greater unity, but East German leaders reject reunification. The specter of a powerful, reunited <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has troubed many Poles, especially the older ones who recall the 1939 Nazi invasion of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> that began World War II. A reported surge in anti-Polish sentiment in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in recent weeks has heightened Polish anxieties. <PERSON> Skubiszewski </PERSON>'s speech seemed designed to reassure Poles that the government does not see unification in the near future and will insist on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s current borders. <PERSON> Skubiszewski </PERSON> faulted West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s program for gradual German reunification, offered last week, for not making clear that reunification would respect the existing border between <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> Some right-wing West German politicians have called for recovering the 40,000 square miles of territory that <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> lost to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> at the end of World War II.

<HEAD>Ex-FBI Man Says His Affair With Soviet Woman Stupid, But He No Spy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, the only <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent ever convicted of espionage, said Thursday his affair with a Soviet woman was `` the stupidest thing I've done in my life'' but declared he never was a spy. `` I love my country,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` I'm a patriotic kind of guy. ... I know in my heart I'm not a traitor.'' The 52-year-old <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was released from prison last month after his conviction was overturned on appeal. While awaiting a third trial he agreed to be interviewed by a group of reporters. In the wide-ranging, two-hour interview, the portly former agent was alternately serious and wise-cracking as he discussed his five years in prison, his lackluster 20-year career with the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, his extramarital affair with <PERSON> Svetlana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON> and his devout return to the teachings of his Mormon faith. `` I am absolutely innocent of any and all of the charges the government put before me,'' he said, `` specifically that I never gave that young lady any kind of document and that is the truth of the matter.'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s lawyers, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, stood by to veto questions on the exact facts of the case, but he eagerly answered most queries. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was convicted of trading a secret <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> reporting guide for money, sex and gold. His attorneys claimed he was no spy but a bumbler who was trying to redeem his lackluster career by infiltrating the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> through Mrs. <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON>, a Soviet emigre. Asked during the interview whether he was a good <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent, he said, `` A lot of the time I was a good <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent. One of the exceptions was the stupid, idiotic thing I tried to do with <PERSON> Svetlana </PERSON>. It was one of the stupidest things I've done. In fact, it was the stupidest thing I've done in my life.'' He added, `` I was not a good <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent in the sense that I did n't have sense enough to protect myself. I try to be an open, honest person and that honesty and openness was misconstrued as a confession.'' He declined to blame the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> for his problems. `` I still have in my heart some loyalty to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said, later adding, `` I do feel I've been mistreated by a handful of people in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>.'' But he insisted, `` I do n't have any bitter feelings against anybody.'' After two trials, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was convicted in 1986 of passing secrets to Mrs. <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Nickolay </PERSON>. His first trial ended with a deadlocked jury. The Ogorodnikovs pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit espionage and are serving prison terms. In April, the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> overturned <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s conviction on grounds that the jury should not have been told that <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> failed lie detector tests. `` I feel I did n't get a fair trial,'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. `` I got the impression that the prosecution as well as the judge were not so much interested in a fair trial or the truth of the matter as to get a conviction.'' He refers to his upcoming trial in May as `` Miller three _ it makes me feel like Rambo.'' He conceded that his sexual indiscretions with Mrs. <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON> and other women brought on his career downfall and the end of his marriage. `` I probably have more guilt over that than any single thing,'' he said. `` I've always tried to be a very moral person and having five affairs in two years is not very moral. ... I guess I got caught up in the sexual revolution of the'80s. It could have partially been mid-life crisis.'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was excommunicated by the Mormon church for his extramarital affairs. But he said his faith is stronger now than ever and it helped him endure five years in federal prison which he called `` devastating.''

 A 6-year-old survivor of the Nimitz Freeway collapse during the Oct. 17 earthquake has been fitted with an artificial leg and `` is in high spirits,'' a therapist says. <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Berumen </PERSON> was given the replacement for his right leg Wednesday at <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where he has been since he was freed from the flattened wreckage of his mother's car. His mother was killed and his 9-year-old sister, <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON>, left the hospital two weeks ago after treatment for head injuries. `` He's going to hate us before it's over, but we're going to make him walk, walk, walk,'' said physical therapist <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> described him as `` tough and in high spirits. He is bouncing right back.'' <PERSON> Julio </PERSON>'s crushed leg had to be amputated to remove him from the wreckage. Forty-two people were killed when an elevated section of the freeway collapsed onto a lower roadway. A total of of 67 people were killed throughout <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in the 7.1-magnitude quake. <PERSON> Julio </PERSON>'s father, Pastor <PERSON> Berumen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, has taken a leave of absence from his construction job and is camped out on a sofa in <PERSON> Julio </PERSON>'s hospital room until the boy walks out.

He probably will eventually be able to ride the bicycle he won in a raffle a few weeks before the quake. A special fund to help pay for his medical bills and education has reached more than $ 160,000.

 A math teacher who was fired for refusing to wear a necktie will return to the classroom next week, school officials said Thursday. `` I'll be wearing a good pair of jeans, a cotton denim shirt and my boots,'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said Thursday. For most of his 20 years in teaching, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> has worn jeans and a work shirt. The school board instituted a new dress code during the 1988-89 school year calling for a tie and dress pants. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> refused, saying he had signed his contract before the dress code was in effect. He also contended that the school board should n't be able to regulate a teacher's choice of clothes. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> was suspended several times and then dismissed in December of 1988 for refusing to conform. The reinstatement came after the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> had to be given his job back while the <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> appeals a lower-court decision that overturned the firing. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mason </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> superintendent of schools, said the reinstatement wo n't halt the board's appeal to the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` One way or another, whether Mr. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> prevails or we prevail ... my goal is to get the system back to normalcy,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. `` And the system is about educating young people.'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> predicts it will take some time to get back into the swing of things. `` I think it will be a little awkward both for me and the students,'' he said. `` They've had a different teacher this year. ... It's unfortunate that they've had to go this type of thing for two years in a row.'' The board is to meet with <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> on Friday, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. Attorneys for the board and <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> are to discuss back pay, which <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> contends he is owed for his time off the job. Since his firing, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> has been farming at his home in <LOCATION> Gallipolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and running an auto body shop. <LOCATION> Gallipolis </LOCATION> is just across the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pleasant </LOCATION>, about 50 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>.

 The city's Armenian community gave an ancient tradition a modern twist, laying on a special meal for the homeless to honor victims of the Soviet republic's killer earthquake one year ago Thursday. `` We wanted to show our gratitude for all those who helped us,'' said <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Zahigian </PERSON>, member of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gregory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armenian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apostolic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. She referred to those in the community who contributed time and aid to victims of the Dec. 7, 1988, disaster. `` Feeding the poor is a good place to start,'' she said after helping serve the first of two meals at the City Mission. She estimated nearly 200 people would sit down to a turkey dinner. `` Forty days after a death, we have a requiem service and a dinner in honor of the deceased,'' said <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Karoghlanian </LOCATION>, church council president. Although the dinner is not 40 days after the deaths _ the biblical time period between the Resurrection of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> and the Ascension _ the meal stems from that tradition, she said. The church in suburban <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> collected $ 134,000 in cash for victims of the quake, which killed more than 25,000 people. The donations will be used as seed money to build a city in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, church treasurer <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Zahigian </PERSON> said. `` The <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> community was very generous in making contributions, not only money but also clothing and medicine,'' said <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatchadorian </PERSON>, local president of the Armenian <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benevolent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. He estimated that there are 1,000 people of Armenian descent in the area. `` We wanted to express our appreciation to all the people in this community for their response to a horrible tragedy,'' he said. Church members prepared turkey, candied sweet potatoes, Armenian-style rice pilaf, green beans and pumpkin pie for Thursday's meal. A dozen members volunteered to serve the dinners to 130 men at the City Mission downtown. `` They're expressing their appreciation to the community and we're thankful,'' said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, who supervises the homeless men who work at the mission and receive shelter in return. The church sent 26 teen-agers to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> over the summer to build a prefabricated house, the first new residence in the quake-damaged community of <LOCATION> Stephanovan </LOCATION>. The church also was host to five children who were treated at hospitals in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> for injuries suffered in the earthquake. All have returned home, Mrs. <PERSON> Karoghlanian </PERSON> said. The quake's one-year anniversary was also commemorated in other regions of the country. In the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area, several Armenian groups Thursday held candlelight vigils, memorial church services and fund-raising walk-a-thons for the victims of the earthquake. The observances will extend through the weekend with a blood drive and memorial services at the several Armenian Apostolic churches throughout the <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the Armenian Philharmonic Orchestra closed its first ever tour of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with a special benefit concert Thursday night at <LOCATION> Carnegie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The orchestra, along with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> pianist <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Watts </PERSON>, has already appeared in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Proceeds of the tour will be used for specific projects in the earthquake zones.

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The General Assembly voted overwhelmingly in favor of a resolution Thursday that calls on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to stop financing <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contra rebels. The assembly passed by a 91-2 margin the Nicaraguan-sponsored resolution against the U.S-backed Contras, who were to be disbanded this week under a regional peace plan. It asked <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to obey a 1986 judgment by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> ordering it to halt support for the Contras. Only the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> voted against the measure. The 41 abstentions included most of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, where an estimated 11,000 Contra forces are headquartered in jungle camps along the Nicaraguan border, also abstained. In a separate action, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> decided by consensus to approve spending up to $ 40.8 million over six months to send a 650-member border patrol force to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The peacekeeping force is intended to deter cross-border raids by the Contras or any other insurgents and to cut off weapons-smuggling. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accuses <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> of shipping weapons to leftist rebels battling <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON>'s government, and the Contras have acknowledged they are selling weapons to the Salvadoran rebels. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> told the assembly that the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling was one-sided, ignoring <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the Central American peace process. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had said it not believe the world court, based in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and serving as the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s judicial arm, could rule on national security issues. The court's 15 judges ruled <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had disobeyed international law by interfering in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s internal affairs with its support for the Contras. The court has no power to enforce its judgments, however. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the Contras ended two years ago, <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> said, and only non-lethal aid is sent to the rebels. By contrast, he said, `` <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s military assistance to the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> insurgents has again been revealed in the recent plane crash at <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Transito </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, which revealed weapons destined for the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> guerrillas.'' Two dozen Soviet-made SAM-7 anti-aircraft missile launchers were found in the wreckage of that light plane, which crashed Nov. 25. Nicaraguan Ambassador <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldera </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` aggression'' against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> continues today. He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> non-lethal aid to the Contras is actually logistical help in the war. In addition, <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldera </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> meddling in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s internal affairs continued when the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> appropriated $ 9 million for the opposition in national elections set for Feb. 25 Under an agreement signed by Central American presidents, the Contras were to be dismantled voluntarily by last Tuesday. However, neither the rebels nor the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were part of that accord. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has proposed extending the deadline to the end of the month. The region's presidents are meeting again Sunday in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> to take up the issue.

<HEAD>Foley Says Defense Budget Cuts `Inevitable'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, said Thursday that improvements in U.S.-Soviet relations make cuts in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s budget `` inevitable.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s comment came as he and other congressional leaders praised President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s actions at last weekend's meeting with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> briefed lawmakers on his talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and on events in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., said afterward that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` probably heard the most praise he'll hear from Democrats in a long time We're all proud of the fact he did a very good job in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s actions at <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> `` wise.'' As for the defense budget, the speaker said he does not anticipate a `` huge, immediate ... peace dividend'' from the lessening of East-West tensions. `` But, undoubtedly, the defense budget is going to go in a downward course relative to the gross national product and relative to government expenditure,'' said <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> expects that and `` I think it's inevitable,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for 40 years has faced a strategic situation in which the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> ... posed a threat, as we saw it, to the security of western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests around the world,'' he said. `` That has n't totally disappeared, but it has -LRB- been -RRB- so largely altered by events of recent months and the last couple of years that to maintain a defense posture ... based on that would be foolish.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> learned Thursday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has decided to seek a $ 292 billion defense budget next year. This year's <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget is $ 286 million; a $ 6 billion increase would not keep pace with inflation. Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` The president did an excellent job in converting what was just goiing to be a meeting, a rendezvous, into an actual summit with substantive discussions.'' <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> should `` meet every year, with or without an agenda,'' just as the president meets annually in an economic summit with leaders of the seven major industrialized democracies.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> voiced strong no-strings support Thursday for Philippine President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, but congressional leaders expressed concern about the depth of opposition to her. During a speech at a political fund-raiser, the president departed from his text to praise Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. `` Just last week democracy was challenged in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` And we stood with President <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and we continue to stand with her and with democracy now. We must not let the democratic process be overthrown by revolution and by military takeover.'' Earlier, press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, traveling with the president on a three-state trip to underline anti-drug efforts and boost Republican candidates, said the administration also has concerns about Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and certain of her government's policies. `` But that does not diminish the fact that we support her and her government and we hope they're successful. We support her government without reservations and do not put strings on that support,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He was asked about comments the day before by a senior administration official suggesting that Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s political future was in doubt _ and that she should be more attentive to eliminating sources of discontent in her country. `` There are a lot of people who are willing to speculate to that effect in private. But, on the record we would not speculate on that. She's a democratically elected leader and we want her to succeed,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters. Leases on the two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and the Subic Bay naval installation _ expire in 1991. Before leaving <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met at the White House with several congressional leaders who commented afterward. House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said, `` It appears that the immediate threat to Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government has been removed, but it's troubling that some of the rebel military elements -LRB- are -RRB- among the most professional and proficient Philippine military.'' Another Democrat, Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, said the coup attempt raised concerns about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, especially regarding the future of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases there. `` We're obviously concerned about what that money's going to be spent on, what the government's going to be there,'' said <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, R-Wyo., said the coup effort was the strongest so far and `` our intelligence shows us if they keep stepping it up grade by grade, she will be in deep trouble. At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> set a more optimistic tone, saying the <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> government `` has shown incredible resilience in this situation.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials expect `` that the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> people can pull together under President <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s leadership,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> concentrated on the anti-drug fight, standing in a park once overrun by drug dealers and likening domestic battles against addiction and crime to the struggles for freedom sweeping Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` As with the new freedom in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, freedom from drugs is n't something the government can give you. You've got to take a stand. You've got to take back the streets. And that's exactly what you did, right here,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He spoke to a civic association at <LOCATION> Winzer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> and praised the community for driving drug dealers out of the park. `` In recent years, the dream on Main Street became the nightmare on Elm Street,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` One thousand people swept into the park. One thousand people swept the drug dealers out. They have n't come back.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` You were united, you were determined, you were angry and you were right.'' On the trip, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also was asked about the senior official's comments on Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, called <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic views `` simplistic'' and said he displayed a lack of sophistication in his meeting at <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> last weekend with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the official should probably have not used the word simplistic and that `` we would n't use that word.'' At the same time, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` there is a lack of knowledge'' on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s part `` about how free enterprise systems work and how market economies work.'' Later, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a Republican fundraising dinner for Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> that his summit last week with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` was a success, a chance to improve an important relationship.'' `` Tensions have been reduced. But there was one area where I had to speak firmly and frankly and that was on <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. There can be no misunderstanding here,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has repeatedly accused the Soviets' allies in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, of funneling East bloc-built arms to the rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, who flew aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said that the event was expected to yield $ 2.8 million, which he said would make it the biggest political fund-raiser in history. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> decided to mix anti-drug speeches with <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> fund-raising appearances, here and then on Friday in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> `` to dramatize the efforts of the president in that area and keep the momentum going.'' Conducting such official business also will reduce the percentage of the cost of the trip that must be picked up by the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who claims <PERSON> Houston </PERSON> as his voting residence, told his Wenzer Park audience, `` It's always great to be back in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. And especially after that little storm in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> _ it's great to be back on dry land.'' `` The talks in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> remind us all that we live in dramatic and exciting times,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said under overcast skies. `` That's true not only in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where people are seeking freedom to travel and freedom to vote _ but right here in the <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION>, where brave men and women have used people power to fight for another kind of freedom. Freedom from fear. Freedom from crime. Freedom from drugs.''

 A Hispanic policeman was found guilty of manslaughter Thursday in the deaths of two black men, and black leaders praised the verdict as a just response to the shooting that set off three days of racial violence. <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Officer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, 31, showed no emotion when he heard the verdict in the Jan. 16 deaths of motorcyclist <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, 23, and passenger <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, 24. The two counts carry a total maximum sentence of 45 years. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Farina </PERSON> deferred adjudication on the jury's findings, an administrative formality to allow a pre-sentencing investigation He ordered everyone involved to return to court Jan. 24. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> remained free on $ 10,000 bond and had to surrender his passport. The televised verdict by the six-member, multi-ethnic jury brought relief to an inner-city black community that feared the trial would spark another round of racial unrest. `` It just shows that our system works if people will give it a chance to work and that there are other ways of impacting the system than through violence,'' said <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, a black community leader who is a member of <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s community relations board. When the verdict was announced, people in the <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> neighborhood where the shooting took place erupted with cheering, horn-honking and hand-slapping. Men and women broke into impromptu solo dances. By 9 p.m., the downtown area was calm. A report of a man wounded in the leg in <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> was possibly drug-related, but not related to the trial, said <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Villorin </PERSON>. About 100 blacks who had met at the shooting site for a march on the courthouse turned the event into a celebration. `` Everyone has been following this from day one,'' said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, 22, who lives in an apartment building across the street from spot of the shooting. `` When the verdict was announced, everyone was relieved and very happy.'' <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> has been racked by racial unrest four times this decade, including riots in 1980 and 1984 sparked by acquittals of police charged in the deaths of blacks. But community leaders praised the presence of two black jurors and the almost gavel-to-gavel live broadcast coverage of the trial as reassuring the community the trial would be fair. `` We were relieved that justice has been served,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubrin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>'s brother-in-law. `` We are very satisfied that the verdict came back guilty on both counts, and that the trial itself was very fair,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Greff </PERSON>, attorney for the <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> family. Some police were dismayed, feeling <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> was defending himself. `` Most of my members are in shock. We all felt <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> was justified,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinne </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Fraternal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, which represents most of the city's officers. Asked what the average officer thinks, <PERSON> Kinne </PERSON> replied: `` He's seriously thinking what he's going to do in a life-threatening situation They could become concerned and hesitant out in the street.'' The jury had deliberated six hours Wednesday and reconvened Thursday, deliberating for an additional 1 -LCB- hours. Defense attorneys and <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>'s family did not offer comment, but left the courtroom quickly, his wife in tears. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, who remains suspended with full pay, talked about his case later at his attorney's office. `` I was not given a fair trial from the beginning. There was a lot of evidence denied and quashed,'' he said. `` We're going to look for a new appeal based on the circumstances.'' He would not elaborate. Defense attorney <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said: `` From the beginning, every major ruling was against us. To even refuse us the right to present witnesses is bizarre. It was critical for the jury to know the motivation of <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> and why he did n't want to stop and why he tried to run over this officer. The jury got a false impression of this case.'' Prosecutors said <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> fired unnecessarily at <LOCATION> Lloyd </LOCATION>, who was fleeing a police car after a traffic violation. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> died of gunshot wounds and <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> died of injuries suffered in the resulting crash. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, said he fired in self-defense when the motorcyclist tried to run him down. The reaction from Colombians in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> was immediate. Colombian-oriented radio station WOCN-AM received 200 calls in the hour after the verdict, said afternoon news coordinator <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>. `` They were unanimous, not one call was against <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>. People were expressing their sadness, some were even crying,'' he said. But he said there was no talk of demonstrations or any violent reaction. `` The jury returned what we thought was a just verdict. It was a jury that represents all segments of our society,'' said Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>, the lead prosecutor. The January riot left one man dead and 11 others wounded. Thirteen buildings were set afire, others were looted, and 372 people were arrested. Announcement of Thursday's verdict was withheld for about two hours while police, social workers and community relations officials fanned out through the city's black neighborhoods. The courthouse was even evacuated of non-essential personnel. Tension was high in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> until the verdict was announced. Rumors of a verdict had grown so strong by Wednesday afternoon that anxious downtown workers reportedly left their jobs early, and <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> Chief Circuit Judge <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Wetherington </PERSON> went on the air to reassure people. For police, there were mixed emotions. `` This is a highly charged and emotional time,'' said Police Chief <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. `` It's only natural to have personal feelings, but as a law enforcement agency we have to abide by state law.'' He said police will continue their vigil. `` We do n't anticipate problems,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. `` We will remain on alert. We'll maintain a high visibility tonight and possibly down-scale our activities tomorrow.''

<HEAD>Consumer Advocates Skeptical About New Auto Insurance Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Insurance companies no longer will be allowed to weight their rates on where a driver lives, according to new state regulations which already are drawing a skeptical reaction from consumer groups. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s insurance commissioner announced a ban Tuesday on territorial rating, a move she said will lower rates for urban drivers and raise rates slightly for rural and suburban drivers. The changes stem from Proposition 103, which was approved by voters in 1988 and requires auto insurance rates based primarily on a driver's safety record, experience and miles driven. The ballot initiative allowed the insurance commissioner to specify other factors an insurance company could consider. That left Commissioner <PERSON> Roxani </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> to decide whether to allow companies to continue to take a driver's residence into account, a factor that has led to much higher rates for inner-city residents. `` The commissioner is promising what we want, but her regulations may deliver exactly what we do n't want and thus may be a fraud and an outright violation of Proposition 103,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Zelman </PERSON>, former executive director of Common Cause and a candidate for the insurance commissioner's job when it becomes an elected position in 1990. <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>, who said she will not run for the post next year, allowed insurers to rely on many other factors that consumer advocates said will play the same role as territorial rating. Those factors include repair costs, health costs and population density. She also limited any driver's annual rate increase to the percentage rise in the national Consumer Price Index and prohibited auto insurance rate discrimination based on sex or marital status. `` The net effect will be decreases for urban -LRB- drivers -RRB- and small increases for rural and suburban,'' <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> said. Drivers with no more than one moving violation in three years will be guaranteed rates at least 20 percent below those of other drivers, <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> told reporters. She said that while a wide range of experts recognize territory as `` a valid rating factor,'' reliance on area of residence under her new system would be `` a little softened from what it is now.'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Murgia </PERSON> of Voter Revolt, sponsor of Proposition 103, said the regulations are `` ninety percent of what we wanted.'' The outstanding question, he said, is how great a role a driver's place of residence will continue to play in rate-setting. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> of Consumers' Union said <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>'s rules would let geographically based rates continue almost unabated. The regulations take effect within 90 days unless blocked in court. A freeze on auto insurance rates will continue until the new rules are implemented, <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> said.

 The chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has written to Gov. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>'s mayor apologizing for an advertisement run in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> belittling the city. The Houston-based airlines also has changed its advertising policy to prevent a similar incident, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> officials said Tuesday. <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON>' press secretary, said an apology was the least <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> could do. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> also is chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company. The governor took exception to a jibe in the ads that asked how often someone would need to go to <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> called it a `` cheap shot'' in light of the 1987 <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> crash of a Boise-bound <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> flight that killed 28 people, 14 of them Idahoans. Mayor <PERSON> Dirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kempthorne </PERSON> said he appreciated the apology but still wanted follow-up advertisements in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> aimed at boosting <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>'s stock as a destination for air travelers. The advertisement, since yanked from publication, pitched 2-for-1 tickets from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and other destinations. The ad admitted there are a few places in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> does not serve, but asked, `` But be honest, how often do you really need to go to <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>?'' <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> pulled out of <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> and seven other Western <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities in September 1988, saying it would focus on more profitable routes. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> wrote in the letter to <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kempthorne </PERSON>, sent by fax machine late Monday, that `` my view of advertising does not include poking fun at any city. `` Furthermore, a copywriter could not have chosen a more unsuitable target for his weak pun. I was appalled to see the effect of these coinciding mistakes,'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> wrote. `` Both <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> share many unhappy memories brought on by the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> accident. I want to continue to do everything possible to mend the wounds that resulted from the tragedy,'' he wrote. Continental has maintained that the ad prepared by a British advertising firm was conceived by people who had no knowledge of the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> crash and was not reviewed at corporate headquarters until after publication. <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> vice president of corporate communication, said a new policy has been adopted. `` All advertising done overseas has to be approved and cleared before publication here at the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> headquarters,'' <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> said.

 Cervical cancer risks increase dramatically for women who fail to get Pap smear tests at least every two years, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> scientists report in a study released today. Women who get Pap smears only every three years run a risk that is 3.9 times greater that cervical cancer will go undetected than women who have the test annually, according to the study published in the professional journal Obstetrics and Gynecology. The study said the risks increase as the between-test interval increases and that for women who have no Pap tests for 10 years or longer, the risk increases by 12.3 times. `` The study shows that women should get Pap smears more frequently than every three years,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Chu </PERSON>, one of five physicians who conducted the study at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>. `` The risk of having advanced disease goes way down if the tests are conducted every two years or less.''

<HEAD>IBM Restructuring the Rule, Not the Exception</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> announced a multibillion restructuring this week it was doing nothing unusual, since almost all the largest corporations have realigned their forces in this decade alone. It was the third strategy shift in the 1980s for the big computer company, formally known as <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Almost a third of big industrial companies have changed three times in the decade, and 50 percent twice. In <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s case, it went after high costs with a plan to save $ 1 billion a year by eliminating 10,000 jobs and consolidating manufacturing facilities. It sought to support <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> stock with a buyback of up to $ 4 billion in shares. Rather than indicating that companies have lost their way, such moves illustrate the vast technological, strategic, financial and other forces that are making and remaking marketplaces. The latest spate of restructurings began in 1986 and is far more complex than any that preceded it, according to Prof. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, who has studied corporate changes for 35 years and advised executives on how to handle them. In strategic planning today, he says, four elements serve as a planning matrix. Two of them, market forces and share value, are externally oriented; two, core technology-expertise and financial resources are internal. These four strategical planning elements, he states, are most commonly found in today's restructurings, since all play vital roles in refocusing efforts on the new and developing realities of the marketplace. 1. Marketing. The big change is that corporations are finding they must give equal attention to three growing markets: <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. It creates a need to balance operating assets around three markets, not one. 2. Share Value. Corporations are realizing that discounted cash flow _ what's left over at the end of the year after paying expenses _ is more important than officially reported earnings in attracting investor attention. In <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>' opinion, the investing public is aware that earnings are too easily manipulated to disguise weaknesses in a company. Cash flow, discounted for the cost of capital, is considered a more reliable indicator of health. Companies are, of course, concerned about the price of their shares. A higher than average price for shares provides a financial advantage over the competition. 3. Core Technology and Expertise. These, says <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, `` must be preserved at all costs.'' Preserving them is not easy, since the hardnosed competitive atmosphere and changing markets mean they are constantly under attack. A common situation today, for example: A company whose core technology and expertise is to supply widgets does n't have the luxury of continuing to make only widgets when the marketplace demands widgets encased in a larger system. It must learn to make the system. Among manufacturers, subsystems of several components are `` in.'' For one thing, they may be easier to assemble, service, and replace.

This concerns the extent to which a company has access to debt financing and equity capital and at what cost. The lower the better, of course. Among other things, this places a premium on maintaining the share price of stock. Buybacks of outstanding shares is one way to do it.

The message is a harsh one for companies accustomed to a slower pace, but he sees no escape from the rapid rate of change. Companies simply can not stay put in their thinking; their environment is not static. They must restructure. An illustration of this can be found in the experience of the 40 `` excellent'' companies chosen early in the decade by author <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> for his book, `` In Search of Excellence.'' All but eight of the 40, according to <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>' count, have been through two restructurings since they were deemed excellent.

 It's 10 p.m. _ curfew time. Police in camouflage fatigues tell diners sipping coffee at the <LOCATION> Pivoli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION> they must leave the restaurant. Nobody complains. `` I do n't mind at all,'' said <PERSON> Omi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON>. `` It keeps all the troublemakers off the streets.'' Like others in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON> vividly remembers the three chaotic days after Hurricane Hugo devastated the island Sept. 17 when hundreds of looters plundered stores of everything from food and clothes to VCRs and jewelry. The authorities say some police officers and members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> took part in the looting. The turmoil prompted President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Sept. 21 to send 1,100 Army troops, most of them military police, along with 170 <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and federal marshals, to restore order in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territory. With most stores cleaned out, the looting had stopped by the time the troops arrived. More than two months after the storm, 80 percent of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> still lacks electricity, water and telephone service. But the troops were ordered home before Thanksgiving and were replaced by 146 National Guard MPs from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>. Many of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>'s 55,000 residents say it was too early to pull the troops out. `` There's no electricity and there are no phones and we have no way to call police,'' said waiter <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Ureta </PERSON>, 31. `` The island is not ready to have people move around like normal days.'' Maj. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said that before leaving the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> set up 14 citizens band stations equipped with telephones for emergencies. A curfew is to remain in effect until power and communications are restored. <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>, 40 miles east of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, was among the islands hardest hit by Hurricane Hugo as it swept up the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> before hitting the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION>. The territorial government has estimated damage at $ 1 billion in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> and its sister islands, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thomas </LOCATION> and <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>. While the other two islands are bouncing back quickly, officials say recovery could take years in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>, where the storm's 200-mph winds damaged or destroyed 90 percent of the houses and buildings. Tourism, <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Croix </PERSON>' lifeblood, is a writeoff this season for the most part. And, despite a construction boom, there are fears of soaring unemployment because scores of businesses were wiped out. <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, with 250 beds, remains closed and doctors are seeing patients in tents behind the building. Thousands live in roofless homes under temporary blue plastic roofs or in <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> tents as they wait for the relief checks from insurance companies and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> Amalie on <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thomas </LOCATION>, the top floor of <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Malley </PERSON>'s house was blown off, but a box containing his miters remained in place. In <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>, workmen had to retile the roof of the <ORGANIZATION> Cormorant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, a hotel and condominium complex, and it has been able to reopen for the winter season. Hundreds have fled the island, perhaps permanently. For those who have stayed to rebuild, life can be a struggle. `` When you go without electricity day after day, for weeks, and you do n't have water and you do n't have a roof over your head and there are no phones and you ca n't communicate with the outside world ... well, there's a lot of stress,'' said commercial photographer <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. About 400 linesmen from a dozen states, <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> are repairing lines of 15,000 downed electricity poles. The <ORGANIZATION> Virgin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> has said it could be spring before electricity is fully restored. Meanwhile, the utility is investigating reports of some workers charging homeowners up to $ 500 to turn power on. But children have returned to school, shelters for victims have closed, and many stores and restaurants along with a few hotels are back in business, using generators for power. Some Crucians, as residents are known, complain that accounts after the hurricane made the looting appear to be an uprising among blacks, who make up 85 percent of the population, against the wealthier whites. They scoff at reports of machete-wielding black gangs roaming the streets. `` I did n't see any white people attacked, but I sensed fear among the white people,'' said <PERSON> Rena </PERSON> <PERSON> Brodhurst-Knight </PERSON>, publisher of the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Croix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, who is black. She said machetes, commonly used in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> as tools, were probably mistaken by outsiders as weapons. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office has filed charges against 15 alleged looters, including <PERSON> Adelbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, commander of the Fredericksted police who was a gubernatorial candidate and a former St. Croix senator.

When he was in the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, he adds, `` not once did I hear somebody say, or did I read anything, suggesting that <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Claus </PERSON> did not exist.'' But then, the show, anchored and narrated by former <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, is about <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>, a syndicated one-hour special called `` There Really Is a <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>.'' Airing on various nights this month on stations in 123 cities, it's a light-hearted `` documentary'' about various facets of the man in the red suit and white whiskers, all of it an effort to prove he exists. Celebrities like <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmos </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mantle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Loretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> are participants, as are men of learning, one of whom believes in the possibility of flying reindeer. Even police in <LOCATION> Fairbanks </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, get in the act. One, responding to a call, asks a homeowner, deadpan: `` He actually was on your roof? In a sleigh?'' And, of course, kids periodically get a say in all this. The men of learning include a <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rassias </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> expert, and a <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>'s helper, Dr. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a psychologist who wrote his <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> dissertation on <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>. The reason he did that, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> explains, is that `` I was struck by the intensity of the children's belief and the joy and excitement that they experienced when they visited <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>.'' Conceived and produced by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a former `` 60 Minutes'' staffer, the show examines the matter of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> from all angles _ his origins, his flying reindeer, how he knows if you've been naughty or nice, and so forth In a section dealing with how Christmas toys get to less fortunate kids, it also slips in a gentle plug for the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s Toys for Tots campaign, founded 42 years ago by retired reserve Col. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendricks </PERSON>. The show has its faults, mainly that it gets a bit too cutesy now and then. But on balance it's a pretty good holiday special, particularly for tykes, who may find its findings reassuring in a world that sometimes seems populated by Grinches with souls of garlic. As <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, quoting a little boy, puts it: `` That there's somebody somewhere in this cruel world who loves children and cares about them _ that's what <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>'s all about.

<HEAD>`Catch 22' Trap Claimed in School Bible Club Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Some call it a `` Catch-22'' snare, zapped if they do, and zapped if they do n't. That's the predicament claimed for some students at <ORGANIZATION> Westside </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, who want an off-hours Bible club. The problem has surfaced at numerous public schools across the country. Federal courts have issued conflicting opinions about it, and although <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has passed a special law allowing for such clubs, the issue is now before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Several church groups, supporting student rights to form such groups, contend Westside put a double-nix on it, barring the club for lack of school sponsorship, although such sponsorship would make the club unconstitutional. Either way, it's out, according to the school board's position, amounting to a `` self-imposed Catch-22'' for the students, the church groups say in a brief supporting the students' appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Efforts at organizing such clubs, strictly by student initiative and without official school involvement, has had a rocky and litigious course in many communities throughout this decade. Trying to dispel the confusion, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adopted the Equal Access Act in 1984, guaranteeing student religious groups the same rights to meet in off-class hours as other non-academic, extracurricular groups. The law was based on rights of free speech _ that schools with a `` limited open forum'' allowing students to organize clubs about politics, dancing, archery, bridge or whatever also must allow clubs that talk religion. But schools have remained skittish about any religious inklings on campus ever since the 1962-63 high court decisions banning sponsored prayer or Bible readings. `` Some educators have come to believe that all religious speech must be extirpated from the schools,'' the churches' brief says, but such a view fails to distinguish between officially sponsored speech and individual rights. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> sought to end discrimination against student religious speech but the brief says `` this case shows that at least some local school officials fundamentally reject each and every premise on which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> acted.'' On the other hand, the American Jewish Committee, which opposes the act, has filed a brief contending that to allow a school religious club would `` open the door to organized religious activities in public schools.'' In a dispute at the <LOCATION> Wiliamport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, high school, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 affirmed the right of students to meet for Bible and prayer outside classtime, but the case was decided on a technical point not generally applicable. Early this year, a federal appeals court ruled against a student religious group at a <LOCATION> Renton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, high school, giving the school discretion to allow clubs considered even remotely related to education, but not if religious. In the dispute at Westside high school, a federal district court upheld the school board's refusal to allow a religious club while permitting about 30 other other clubs, such as for chess and scuba diving. But a federal appeals court overturned that decision, rejecting the school's position that the various clubs were curriculum-related. That claim, the court said, would allow a school administration simply to choose whatever clubs it wished for vague reasons, but then to `` discriminate against particular student groups'' because of religious speech. `` It would be tragic if the court allows a school board to eviscerate'' the Equal Acess Act `` by declaring all clubs except relgious ones to be ` curriculum-related','' says <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, general counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Public Affairs. Other groups joining in the brief were the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scoiety </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evangelicals </ORGANIZATION>, the Presbyterian Church -LRB- USA -RRB- and the Church of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> of Latter-day <ORGANIZATION> Saints </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Catholic Bishops have filed their own brief, affirming rights of students to form voluntary Bible clubs. The brief says the action of the school officials, instead of upholding the Constitution, have created a constitutional problem `` by inhibiting religious activity and conveying a message of disapproval of religious activity to both the students involved and the community at large.'' Oral arguments before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> are expected to be heard this month or early next year, with a decision by next summer. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Bridget </PERSON> <PERSON> Megens </PERSON>, who with friends initiated attempts for a Bible club at <ORGANIZATION> Westside </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 and is now married and the mother of a young daughter, says: `` I was afraid there might not be anybody to carry the torch.'' However, she says about 15 students still are pushing the effort. `` There are even some kids who are not Christians who are interested,'' she told the monthly Church and State. She says she hopes the dispute will be resolved so her daughter can belong to a Bible study group at her high school when she grows up.

<TEXT>
 This is a summary of the Disaster Assistance Act of 1988 and procedures farmers followed to collect aid. The program originally was written to provide cash to farmers who suffered crop losses of more than 35 percent `` due to drought, hail, excessive moisture or related condition in 1988.'' Farmers who lost more than 65 percent of their normal harvest were required to protect themselves with federal crop insurance this year. The bill covered all crops in all states, not just drought areas. As its regulations moved from the halls of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to the county offices where the checks were written, the list of weather conditions eligible for aid grew. It eventually included _ depending on the individual county _ insects, sandstorms, fungus, high winds and cold. The bill required farmers to state their acreage, whether it was irrigated and-or insured, the normal yield and the actual production on that acreage. They also had to state the cause for their loss, and in what manner the land had been farmed. Their applications for aid were approved or denied by three-member committees of locally elected farmers serving as the government's agents. Regulations require only 5 percent of aid applications to be verified for accurate information, although many offices said they routinely checked 15 percent. As with other farm payment programs, paperwork remained at the county offices; no regulation requires data on individual farms to be routinely forwarded to state or federal headquarters. The relief act stated that payments were limited to $ 100,000 per farmer and that no producer with gross revenues in excess of $ 2 million was eligible for aid. Checks were written at the county office. Only county totals of aid, not individual summaries, were fed into national computers. Federal agriculture officials have not yet compiled figures on the amount of aid disbursed based on the crops damaged or on the specific weather problems cited for crop losses.

<HEAD>Highlights of 1988, 1989 Disaster Relief Programs</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Cashing In on Drought II, b0389</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The 1988 drought assistance bill for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farmers set a record for disaster programs, totaling $ 3.9 billion in payments when all applications had been processed. This year, with the drought area reduced and the severity lessened, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> tightened eligibility requirements and pulled the purse strings tighter, authorizing less than 25 percent of the money released in 1988. Here are details of the two relief programs:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>The Money</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 _ Congress authorized $ 3.9 billion in cash payments to farmers who could prove crop losses in 1988; the 1989 authorization is $ 897 million _ Both programs set a $ 100,000 limit per producer on combined payments for crop losses and livestock relief
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Eligibility Requirements</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 _ Under each program, an applicant could not have a gross annual income greater than $ 2 million _ Growers had to absorb crop losses if they totaled less than 35 percent of normal production The programs differed for losses above 35 percent. The 1988 bill encompassed all crops, from such `` program crops'' as corn, wheat and cotton that the government supports with price subsidies to riskier crops like kiwi fruit or endive. The 1989 bill pays on losses of 35 percent to 50 percent only for program crops. Farmers of non-program crops are paid only if losses totaled more than 50 percent of a normal harvest. Whether producers receive aid also depends on whether they participated in federal commodity programs and bought crop insurance. _ The 1988 bill provided two tiers of payment Farmers received 65 percent of a pre-established payment rate _ based on such factors as market prices and subsidies _ for losses of 35 percent to 75 percent of normal production; they got 90 percent of the payment rate if losses topped 75 percent. In 1989, the highest payment for any loss was 65 percent of the payment rate.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Crop Insurance</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 _ Both programs required farmers with losses greater than 65 percent to buy federal crop insurance the subsequent year Each bill permitted some instances in which crop insurance could be waived.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Replanting Penalty</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 _ The 1988 bill permitted farmers to receive aid on the early loss of crops such as winter wheat or cotton, even if they replanted the same acres with different crops and had normal harvests To prevent such `` double dipping,'' the 1989 law sharply reduced benefits to farmers who chose to plant replacement crops due to drought or other weather conditions. Critics said this penalized farmers who were simply trying to help themselves, and the law was modified in October to be more generous. As modified, aid payments on damaged crops will be reduced only if the value of the replacement crop is more than half of the county's average yield, and then only by the value above the 50 percent threshold.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Livestock Provisions</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 _ Both programs provided help for livestock producers, expanding existing feed and water programs to relieve drought-related shortages for herds Eligible livestock include cattle, sheep, goats, swine, poultry, horses and mules, and fish raised in commercial ponds.

 The drought of 1988 hit hardest in the upper <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> _ perhaps nowhere harder than in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. More disaster relief aid went there than to any other state. The third story in a four-part series, `` Cashing In on the Drought,'' examines how the $ 3.9 billion disaster aid program helped farmers most in need.

 <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Grindberg </PERSON> survived the drought with a $ 45,000 dose of federal aid. But for this farmer and others, it was a give-and-take bailout: take the money with one hand, give it away with the other. `` The guy who sold me $ 5,000 of fuel, he got paid,'' <PERSON> Grindberg </PERSON> said. `` The business that sold me fertilizer and spray and chemicals and tires, they got paid. What I'm saying is, the farmer got the money directly, but indirectly a lot of others benefited.'' The 1988 drought relief program poured more than $ 400 million into <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, the nation's most agriculturally dependent state. The money not only helped rescue thousands of farmers; many say it also kept the state afloat. `` It's what carried us through in 1988,'' said <LOCATION> Cass </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> extension agent <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>. `` If it had n't been for drought aid, the economic situation all through <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> would have been disastrous. It was the major source of income for most farmers.'' `` I do n't think too many farmers took disaster aid and bought Cadillacs and went on vacation in my area,'' <PERSON> Grindberg </PERSON> added. A study of the $ 3.9 billion disaster relief program, conducted by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> over seven months, found that outside the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> drought area, lax rules and requirements led to thousands of farmers collecting millions of dollars for nothing more serious than the normal trials of nature. But money did reach areas <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> most intended to aid, including <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, where it kept some farmers on their land and may have prevented some business closures. `` You might say it kept the state alive,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Selberg </PERSON>, another farmer in this <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION>. `` Everyone in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> in some way or another was helped.'' <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, where the drought evoked memories of Dust Bowl days with tumbleweed dancing along the barren horizon, received the most disaster dollars. More than 49,000 producers shared $ 410.2 million _ about 10.5 percent of the total package. Almost all was for crop loss. The state, the No. 1 producer of hard-red spring wheat, lost two-thirds of its 1988 crop; millions of normally golden acres withered to pathetic rows of shriveled brown stumps. But drought aid cut farmers' losses from $ 1.1 billion to $ 706 million, a <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> study found. Disaster payments reduced statewide losses to businesses, banks and households from $ 3.4 billion to $ 2.1 billion, the study said. Each farm dollar triples as it travels down Main Street into the economy. Another university survey of 466 farmers said that without drought aid, the average farmer's net cash income would have been just $ 6,300. Drought payments added $ 15,000. Disaster aid and crop insurance also were critical to other drought-ravaged states, including <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. The five states together received nearly half the assistance allocated nationwide. Disaster aid and crop insurance pumped about $ 500 million into <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s economy, an <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> study said. `` There was no question it was needed to stave off a major new wave of bankruptcies and financial problems among Corn Belt producers,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, a university economist. `` Even the drought assistance for most farmers fell well short of bringing what their income would be with normal yields, but it provided a safety net,'' he said. It was the same in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, which has struggled with an exodus of young, educated people, declining revenues, fading small towns and the loss of nearly a fifth of its farms this decade. `` From'81 through'86, the bottom pretty much fell out of everything,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON>, who farms about five miles from <LOCATION> Grindberg </LOCATION>. Good crops the next two years started to reverse the trend, but drought stalled the recovery. `` It has a demoralizing effect when you have a disaster,'' said <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Aakre </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> State economist. `` Financial aid helps to alleviate that. The last thing <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> needed is more negatives to push us down.'' Despite relief and nearly $ 200 million in crop insurance, the state still needs `` a good year to get back on our feet,'' <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> said. `` We did n't get that in'89,'' he added, referring to continuing drought in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s west and south-central sections. In fact, while crops statewide are in better shape than 12 months ago, dollar losses will exceed 1988's estimated $ 530 million, <PERSON> Aakre </PERSON> said. Two reasons why: more acres of wheat were planted this year, and farmers do n't have grain reserves to sell at high prices as they did in 1988 to ease their burden. <PERSON> Cass </PERSON> <PERSON> County </PERSON> also had a better 1989 crop but expects higher losses in crop dollars. And while virtually all farmers here received government aid in 1988, far fewer will be eligible a second time. About $ 19.8 million in 1988 aid was divvied up among 1,847 farms in <LOCATION> Cass </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, the state's leader in crop acres. Wheat, corn, barley, soybeans, sugar beets and navy and pinto beans are grown here. Last year, production was 60 percent to 70 percent below normal. For <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, a 36-year-old father of three who farms 1,000 acres near the town of <LOCATION> Horace </LOCATION>, $ 39,000 in aid, even coupled with $ 55,000 in crop insurance, amounted to `` just enough to break even. We were able to cover all our bills. That's all I had really hoped for.'' If that seems like a lot, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, who grows wheat, soybeans and barley, notes it costs him $ 150,000 for rent, interest, seed, fertilizer, equipment and other necessities. `` You throw a lot of expenses way ahead of what your crop is going to be,'' he said. `` Our investment in farming is tremendous compared to the average businessman. At least they have a commodity to sell. We might not.'' <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON>, who farms 6,000 acres, said that without his $ 100,000 maximum payment he might have been forced to sell equipment or lay off help. Along with crop insurance and the sale of grain reserves, he said, `` I was able to mark time in'88. ... Last year we had a break-even type of year. This year it was break-even. Next year, we're going to have to start coming around to a profit.'' <PERSON> Grindberg </PERSON>, who farms 900 acres of wheat, soybeans and barley, was in the red last year despite $ 70,000 in aid and insurance. His 1989 crop was better but still below normal; he expects to get only $ 3,000 in relief payments. <PERSON> Grindberg </PERSON>, a 40-year farming veteran who also delivers mail part-time, thinks the government last year `` pushed the panic button on this disaster thing and went too far. In'89, they went too far the other way I think.'' `` Disaster aid is political,'' he said. `` Depending on when you have the disaster depends on whether they sweeten the pot or not. If it's an election year ... they all get on the bandwagon.'' But <PERSON> Grindberg </PERSON> will persist. `` As long as the banker says go on,'' he said, `` next year's always the best year.

 Not all who collected aid from the 1988 drought program were Midwestern farmers faced with ruin. Cotton farmers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, lettuce growers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> company that raised potatoes, all collected federal dollars _ completely legally _ even though, by their own admission, they could have weathered last year's drought. Here are some stories of aid that spilled beyond the boundaries of the 1988 drought:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Last year was n't so bad for Conowingo, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, dairyman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON>. Good rains in July rescued his feed corn from six weeks of no rain, and milk prices were up. But when he heard about the disaster program, he went over his records with county officials. Two hours of paperwork and he was told he qualified for $ 1,200. `` Six hundred dollars an hour,'' <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> said with a grin as he milked his 140 Guernseys in his long, open barn. `` That's not bad pay. About the same as a lawyer.'' <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> makes no apologies about taking the money. `` It was there and I took advantage of it,'' he said. But he does n't favor a repeat of the program. `` It would make people say, I can put crops in the ground and if it does n't grow, I'll collect,'' he said.

 <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Lathem </PERSON> and his family are what you might call diversified farmers. They run a real estate company; grow wheat, corn and milo; raise cattle; and own three oil wells that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> operates on their <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Panhandle land. To participate in federal price support programs for their main crops of wheat, corn and milo, they have to set aside some acres. In 1988, they planted potatoes on 125 of those acres _ and saw hail wipe out the crop. Other crops did well. But the <PERSON> Lathem </PERSON> family was far from being knocked out of farming by hail on potatoes planted on excess acres. Their farm, formally named the <ORGANIZATION> Lico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partnership </ORGANIZATION>, received $ 134,087 under the drought program, legally exceeding the $ 100,000 single-farmer aid limit because the partnership is owned by four family members. The potatoes were insured and were expected to gross $ 223,600 for <PERSON> Lico </PERSON>, according to <PERSON> Lico </PERSON>'s file at the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Insurance plus the disaster aid brought $ 214,153 _ without the expense of harvest, which <PERSON> Lathem </PERSON> said would have been two-thirds the cost of raising the potatoes. Still, he said he only broke even on the potato acreage. `` You bet it was necessary,'' <PERSON> Lathem </PERSON> said. `` We would n't have lost the farm over it, but we probably would have had to do some things differently. It would have been much tougher to go back and plant crops for the new year. I think it was a good program.''

 The 1987 growing year, plagued by heavy rain and high winds, was horrible for <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chaves </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, cotton grower, but no disaster payment program existed to help him then. White got luckier in 1988, because of the record-setting drought in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. Although he had a better crop in 1988, he was able to collect disaster aid. `` I had a cold, cold, cold rain and then that wind that comes down like on a runway and just cuts the cotton,'' said White. About half his cotton was wiped out last year, although his irrigated fields still yielded a healthy 355 pounds per acre and he made about two-thirds of his normal gross, based on government payment rates. Insurance paid $ 8,959, and drought aid approved by the local <ORGANIZATION> ASCS </ORGANIZATION> office paid $ 18,285 _ even though the disaster law included neither cold weather nor high winds.

A well that fed a special trickle irrigation system for some of his orchards dried up A pump that watered his corn failed at the height of the dry weather. Yet Race weathered the drought well; good production on other acres eased his losses. So he went to the county office with some trepidation to inquire about the 1988 drought relief program. He learned he was entitled to a payment, but he felt uncomfortable with government programs. `` It's kind of a personal pride thing. You think you're asking for welfare,'' he said. `` I was thinking some low interest loans of 4.5 percent, that would be great.'' Instead, he got cash, nearly $ 12,000. `` I sat and wondered, ` What am I going to do with $ 12,000?''' he said. `` I decided the best way to spend the money was to buy an irrigation pump.'' He spent $ 13,000 for a pump. Then came 1989 and its endless rains. `` It's been sitting out there, rusting ever since,'' Race, laughing, said of his new pump.

Months later, unexpected help arrived in the form of the drought relief bill _ a program that had n't even been considered when the winds took his wheat. He collected $ 11,499. `` If the wheat had been good, we would have made twice that much,'' <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> said. `` I'd rather have a big wheat crop than take a check from the government anytime.''

 When drought parched 1988 crops, a relief program was already in place. But that program, federally subsidized crop insurance, has been a shambles for years. The final story in a series, `` Cashing In on the Drought,'' shows even critics believe <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must rely on a stronger insurance network to eliminate big bailouts that follow natural disasters.

<TEXT>
 In 1980, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> expanded its 42-year-old federal crop insurance program. The goal was simple: farmers would better cover themselves against the vagaries of nature and taxpayers would be spared costly disaster payments to farmers. It has n't turned out that way. Sales of crop insurance are well below expected levels. The program is billions deep in red ink and under scrutiny after years of alleged mismanagement. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> still bails out farmers with huge relief programs like the 1988 drought bill. `` Farmers are just the same as <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>; they'll take a gamble if it means money,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a farmer and former <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> congressman who sponsored the 1980 bill. `` They do n't care about insurance if they think they are going to get a disaster payment. Last year was perfect illustration. With only 13 percent of the nation's estimated 3.3 million farmers relying on government-subsidized insurance, they collected $ 3.9 billion in direct aid and an additional $ 1.1 billion in crop insurance payments. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> study of the 1988 disaster program found farmers who said they were `` made whole'' by both programs, earning as much or more in insurance claims and disaster payments as they would have with normal harvests. `` While <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed a law for crop insurance to be the single source of aid in a time of disaster, that never happened because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> refused to let it happen,'' said <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, an assistant director at the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, which issued 20 reports on problems with crop insurance over the last nine years. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would come in with disaster payments _ a free bailout _ any time there was a disaster,'' said <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>. `` If you were a farmer, why would you buy insurance if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is going to bail you out for free?'' Farmers, wise to the ways of politics, agree. `` You'd be crazy to buy insurance if you can count on a disaster program,'' said <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Milton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, farmer who received a $ 100,000 disaster payment for peas and lima beans lost to drought last year. <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON> also collected insurance on some losses, but he is no fan. `` You could hit it close if you bought insurance on odd number years and did n't on election years when you're more likely to get aid,'' he said. Yet crop insurance is still considered the best protection for farmers. A September <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report said insurance `` is a more equitable and efficient way to provide disaster assistance than emergency loan and direct payment programs.'' Until this decade, crop insurance, begun in 1938, was limited to 26 crops on 10 percent of the nation's farmland. That changed with the Federal Crop Insurance Act of 1980, a bill to make insurance all farmers' first line of defense against losses from drought, flood, insects and blight. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> envisioned a self-sustaining program. Farmers would buy insurance to cover losses, just like any other business enterprise. Government clerks would be replaced by private agents, selling policies amid corn rows and wheat fields. Most importantly, disaster payments would be phased out. Banishing these expensive programs, essentially free insurance for farmers, would trim the budget and make growers more responsible. `` There were abuses ... examples of people planting even when there was no soil moisture and they knew there would be no harvest,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a former staff member with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` Farmers used bad management knowing there was this entitlement at the end of the crop year.'' Crop insurance coverage grew slowly over the decade. Last year only 25 percent of the nation's farm fields were insured, well under the 50 percent targeted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The figure hit 40 percent this year, but only because farmers who were paid for losses greater than 65 percent last year had to buy insurance for 1989. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has lost money every year since 1980, a total of more than $ 4 billion. Losses in 1988 alone amounted to $ 579 million. As the federal tab for crop insurance went up, so did the cost of the special disaster programs the insurance was to eliminate. From 1974 to 1980 farmers received $ 3 billion in disaster payments. The cost has soared beyond $ 7 billion this decade. Insurance rates are based on the risk insurance companies run of paying a claim. Car insurance rates, for example, are based on actuarial study of losses to accidents and theft, the amount of money the insurer is likely to pay, and the amount of premium money the company is likely to collect and invest. But the <ORGANIZATION> FCIC </ORGANIZATION>, without a certified actuary until 1986, made optimistic forecasts that did n't match experience. One example: premium income grew by only 10 percent from 1982 through 1986, never exceeding $ 440 million a year. Yet the <ORGANIZATION> FCIC </ORGANIZATION> predicted premium income of $ 700 million in 1987. It collected little more than half that. `` The program is actuarily unsound,'' acknowledged <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FCIC </ORGANIZATION> manager since 1988. `` To some extent our problems are the result of expanding too rapidly. We did n't get our rates, policies and procedures in place based on good research.'' <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Rehoboth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, insurance agent, recalls a policy that lumped lima beans and snap beans together, even though they have different growing seasons and risks. `` When I called to talk to the man who wrote the policy, he said, ` I did n't know there was a difference between a lima bean and a snap bean,''' she said. `` I told them I was going to put the policy under my desk. I was n't going to insult these farmers.'' The corporation has been criticized for not keeping a tight rein on the private insurers who sell and service crop insurance. A 1987 <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> study found farmers were overpaid an average of 31 percent on claims. At present, farmers can insure 50, 65 or 75 percent of their crop, in the way a car owner chooses a deductible on auto insurance. Farmers also choose what percentage of market price to be compensated for. The <ORGANIZATION> FCIC </ORGANIZATION> subsidizes 15 percent to 30 percent of premium costs depending on coverage. But rates and regulations change yearly. `` If you're going to insure a 1981 <LOCATION> Bronco </LOCATION>, you get a quote and it's done,'' said Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON>. `` With crop insurance you have different levels of coverage and different price selections. It can get really confusing.'' With all its problems, even critics believe crop insurance is improving. A recent <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> study found the overpayment rate had dropped to 16 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> FCIC </ORGANIZATION> is studying decades of weather and crop reports to bring premiums in line with the actual cost of insuring a crop. `` We are seeing some bright spots,'' said <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>.

 To hear <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> economists tell it, the nation's farmers, as a group, have n't had it so good in years. That would seem to go against all evidence in plain sight. The money crunches of the middle 1980s and the droughts of the last two years were painful, sometimes terminal, for thousands of farm families. No one is sure how many farmers had to leave the land. Annual estimates by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> indicate that about 267,000 farms `` disappeared'' in the 1980s, a decrease from 2.44 million in 1980 to about 2.17 million in 1989. Of those, 40,000 have dropped out since 1987. But not all of those left farming due to failure, bankruptcy, foreclosure or drought; each decade realizes some attrition. Compare the 267,000 dropouts in the 1980s with 516,000 in the 1970s, 1 million in the 1960s and 1.7 million in the 1950s. Drought in 1988 hurt vast areas, particularly the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and upper <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>. And in places, the land remains parched, with too little moisture soaking below the surface. But most farmers profited as the 1988 drought reduced crop yields and drove up prices. This fall, bigger corn yields have driven down prices of feed grains, making it cheaper to feed cattle, hogs and chickens but hurting the grain farmers. The 1989 corn harvest is up 54 percent from last year's drought-shriveled crop Wheat is up 13 percent, and the soybean crop is 25 percent larger. In 1987, according to the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, farmers' net cash income rose to a record $ 57.7 billion from $ 51.8 billion in 1986 and $ 46.7 billion in 1985. The climb marked a turnaround in farm fortunes after falling land values, high interest rates and heavy debts squeezed hard in the early 1980s. In 1988, net cash income rose further, to $ 59.9 billion, reflecting higher crop prices because of the drought, near-record government payments and sales of stored surpluses. This year, with government payments declining, surpluses running out and farmers spending more to expand crop acreage, net cash income is expected to decline to $ 53 billion. In 1990, according to the latest projections, net cash income may rise to almost $ 55 billion. Net cash income, as defined by the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, is the difference between gross cash income and cash expenses in a calendar year. It's money left over that can buy new equipment, retire debt and support the farm family. Another measurement is called net farm income. This includes the value of farm inventories of grain, cattle, hogs and other production in a calendar year, along with allowances for other `` non-money'' items such as the value of home-grown food and xisting dwellings. By that reckoning, net farm income rose to $ 32.4 billion in 1985, $ 38 billion in 1986 and $ 47.1 billion in 1987. Last year, according to this method, net farm income declined to $ 45.7 billion _ still the second highest on record. Net farm income this year is forecast at about $ 48 billion, and it may be in the range of $ 44 billion to $ 49 billion in 1990. These are national figures, and agency analysts are quick to acknowledge that many farmers are suffering financially, even when farmers as a group are enjoying the best of times. But even some state statistics show farmers have fared better in recent years than many would have believed likely in the early'80s. For example, net cash income increased in 33 states in 1988 despite the drought, even in some of the states that were hardest hit. On the basis of net farm income, which take farmer-held inventories into account, 27 states showed increases from 1987. `` Overall, the country's farm financial performance continued to improve in 1988, as it had in 1986 and 1987,'' said <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Morehart </PERSON>. <PERSON> Morehart </PERSON> noted that direct government payments to farmers, which peaked at $ 16.7 billion in 1987, dropped 13 percent to $ 14.5 billion in 1988. The latest estimates put direct payments at $ 11 billion in 1989 and $ 8 billion to 11 billion in 1990. Annual records kept by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> indicate that total farm assets, mostly land, have been increasing since they dropped to $ 787.1 billion in 1986. The record high was more than $ 1.1 trillion in 1981. This year's assets are forecast at $ 849 billion and may grow to as much as $ 890 billion in 1990. Total farm debt by 1988 was $ 138 billion and may drop to $ 136 billion in 1989. In the early and mid-1980s, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm debt was as high as $ 206.5 billion, including family household debt.

<HEAD>Bureaucracy Shifts Into Reverse To Dismantle Catastrophic-Care Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal bureaucrats and private insurers are scrambling to rework health insurance benefits, adjust premiums and spread the word that the end is near for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>'s year-old catastrophic health care program. In addition, millions of senior citizens are refiguring their expected 1989 tax bills, the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is scrapping Form 8808 before it hits the printing press, and states are trying to figure out how they will cover an extra $ 300 million to $ 400 million in health care expenses for the poor. The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act _ expected to cost $ 48 billion in its first five years _ was enacted with fanfare in 1988 to protect 33 million elderly and disabled people against financial ruin from the staggering costs of prolonged illness. But even before most of the benefits took effect, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> voted last month to dismantle the program because of a firestorm of protest from senior citizens who complained it cost them too much. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has promised to sign the repeal measure. Under repeal, the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> must take back the extended hospitalization and nursing home coverage it has offered <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> beneficiaries for the past year and scrap plans to provide expanded coverage of drug and doctor bills and other medical expenses. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hays </PERSON>, the acting <ORGANIZATION> HCFA </ORGANIZATION> administrator, said a top priority for the agency is to get notices out to <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> beneficiaries explaining the new limits on their hospital and nursing home benefits. `` We want to make sure that there is n't confusion,'' <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> said. The agency also can forget about providing additional medical benefits that `` we had invested enormous energy and time in preparing to implement,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, have the tasks of rolling back the income tax surcharge on the elderly and the extra Medicare premium that financed the catastrophic program. The surtax was canceled completely; the extra premium will be scrapped at the end of the year. <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said taxpayers will be instructed to ignore two lines on this year's 1040 tax forms _ lines 54 and 55 _ which refer senior citizens to the elusive Form 8808 that never got beyond the prototype stage. Higher-income senior citizens would have used 8808 to calculate their added income tax liability for the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> benefits. Senior citizens who paid extra amounts in quarterly income tax payments or through wage withholding to cover the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> surtax will get any overpayments back as part of their income tax refund, <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said. About 40 percent of the elderly would have paid some surtax _ $ 22.50 for every $ 150 of federal income tax liability _ with about 6 percent paying the maximum amount of $ 800 per person this year. Scrapping the tax is the type of last-minute change it is easy to spring on taxpayers, <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said. `` Everybody enjoys hearing news that they do n't have to pay a tax that was on the books,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, is complaining that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did not give the agency enough lead time to stop withholding extra Medicare premiums that helped finance the catastrophic benefits. It may be April or May before extra payments of about $ 5.30 a month no longer are deducted from Social Security checks, with the overpayments to be refunded later. The premiums of $ 4 a month during 1989 will not be refunded. `` The bottom line is that Social Security will unscramble this egg, but we did not lay it,'' said Social Security Commissioner <PERSON> Gwendolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>. The repeal also is causing last-minute maneuvering among private insurers who will pick up some of the benefits being canned by the government. About 70 percent of elderly Americans purchase private `` medigap'' insurance to fill the gaps in their Medicare coverage. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioners </ORGANIZATION> has until Dec. 15 to draft transition regulations for medigap policies, and private insurers have until Jan. 30 to revise their policies and premiums and notify policyholders of the changes. Any changes, however, will be retroactive to Jan. 1, when the government benefits expire. `` Insurance companies are doing their best, they're just grumbling about how long it took <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to make up their mind,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's kind of a ` We'll muddle through' situation. We just hope <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> does n't change their mind again next year.'' The association has estimated medigap premiums will rise 20 percent to 25 percent next year due to the combined effects of rising medical costs and the repeal of the catastrophic package. Fallout from the repeal also is reaching state governments. The repeal legislation left in place expanded Medicaid costs for the states, while scrapping provisions that would have offset some of the new expenses, said <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelrine </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> `` Grumbling is probably a tame word to describe what is going on out there,'' Ms. <PERSON> Pelrine </PERSON> said. `` States are already so maxed out on their ability to accommodate various -LRB- federal -RRB- mandates ... that a lot are saying, ` We do n't know how we're going to pay for this.''' <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION>, said the original catastrophic legislation would have cost states $ 900 million, but the repeal bill boosts those costs by an additional $ 300 million to $ 400 million.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is not letting its military guard down despite the easing of East-West tensions in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Even after the sessions between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> off <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, officials here say <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s defense budget will continue the decade-long upward momentum that has made this country one of the world's top military spenders. `` Our own efforts for improving our self-defense are not expected to change at the moment,'' <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Taizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> said at a news conference when asked if the <LOCATION> Bush-Gorbachev </LOCATION> meetings would affect <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s military spending. <PERSON> Seiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishihiro </PERSON>, vice minister of defense, said recent movements in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and developments in U.S.-Soviet relations would be considered. But he told reporters <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> must continue its policy to reach the minimum standards of military preparedness set out in 1976; <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have yet to sign a treaty to formally end World War II. `` There may have been a change in the Soviets' mood with the recent detente, but we have n't seen any practical reduction in force,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> official, who requested anonymity. `` We ca n't start cutting our forces just because they say they plan to cut theirs.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> agrees with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> about Soviet forces in <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> but is talking about cutting its own defense outlays. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, is calling on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to spend more to help make <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reductions possible. Under heavy pressure from <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has signed a defense bill that urges <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to increase its military spending and requires the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> executive to negotiate an agreement for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to completely offset the costs of maintaining the 50,000 American servicemen and women stationed here. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> currently shoulders about $ 2.8 billion, or 45 percent, of the annual expenses for the Americans in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The Japanese government has refused official comment on the bill signed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Because of sensitivities caused by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s defeat in World War II, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> generally has observed a self-imposed ceiling of 1 percent of gross national product on its defense spending. Although that mark has been surpassed slightly each year since 1985, critics in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> call the ceiling artificially low, and compare it to the annual <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense budget of $ 300 billion, or roughly 6 percent of GNP. Western estimates put Soviet military spending at roughly 15 percent to 25 percent of GNP. <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> has increased expenditures to support its 274,000 military personnel by about 5 percent in real terms every year since 1980, and its current defense outlays are roughly equal to those of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Expenditures under <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s current five-year plan will total $ 76.5 billion, and next year's budget is expected to top 4 trillion yen -LRB- $ 27.8 billion -RRB-. The increases have helped <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> create a sophisticated anti-submarine network in straits vital to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> navy in the <LOCATION> northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and build up an impressive number of advanced fighter jets, which by 1990 will reach roughly 300 _ about the same number deployed by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> to defend the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The buildup, however, risks alienating <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries that harbor bitter memories of Japanese invasions before and during World War II. At the same time, anti-military sentiment in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, coupled with a Constitution that bans the use of military force, has restricted the operations of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces, making it difficult for Japanese politicians to meet <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands or their own goals to expand the military. <PERSON> Katsuyoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimura </PERSON>, head of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deliberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview that Japanese troops should be allowed to take part in <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire missions, emergency rescues after natural disasters and other non-lethal tasks abroad. `` All we are suggesting is that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> do what is common sense for other nations,'' <PERSON> Kimura </PERSON> said. `` Some people abroad say that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is willing to put out the money, but not the sweat.'' After an unprecedented victory in Diet elections last summer, the leading opposition <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> called for declaring <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> a nuclear-free zone and conducting strict searches to ensure <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships entering Japanese ports do not carry nuclear weapons. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 7th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> is based in <LOCATION> Yokosuka </LOCATION>, just south of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, and a nuclear-free zone would challenge <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy of not revealing the location of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear arms. Like a wall between <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is both a first line of defense against the Soviet military and a crucial <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally should war break out. About 60 percent of all Soviet ground and air force divisions and 90 percent of the bombers in the Far East are deployed near <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, according to `` Defense of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> 1989,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> report. The Soviet Pacific Fleet, the largest in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> navy, has its home port in <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION>. The Soviets also have about 10,000 soldiers on the southern Kurils, several small islands off Hokkaido, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s northernmost island, the report said. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> claims the islands, known as the Northern Territories, which were occupied by the Soviets after World War II, and the territorial dispute has kept <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the Soviet Union from signing a treaty officially ending their World War II hostilities. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON>, in a recent interview, said Soviet forces in the region `` far exceed any defensive requirements,'' and meaningful reductions have not been made. `` To date, the reductions they have foreshadowed do not have much effect on the forces that are located in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> region,'' he said. Even so, <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s assistant <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> adviser, said `` no one but a fool'' would risk waging war with the U.S.-Japan alliance in the northern <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. `` If the two largest economies in the world can maintain relative harmony, all other potential adversaries must, of necessity, come to our table,'' he said in a recent speech in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s decade-long shopping spree is over for now, squelched by a government austerity program that has pushed the nation precariously close to recession. Color televisions, an item the Chinese once needed patience and good connections to obtain, are piling up by the millions in warehouses. The nation's top refrigerator maker, <PERSON> Wanbao </PERSON>, has slashed prices by up to 30 percent in some places because of poor sales. In <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, the nation's industrial hub, sales of televisions, washing machines and cameras were all down more than 50 percent in October compared with a year earlier. Retail sales totaled 607 billion yuan, or roughly $ 164 billion, in the first three quarters of the year, down 8.2 percent from the same period in 1988 if inflation is taken into account. Never before in the 10 years of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s market-oriented reforms have sales declined so sharply. On the contrary, the enormous demand for consumer goods in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had led to sales leaps over most of the past decade. Sales of televisions, for example, went from 1.8 million in 1979 to 26.6 million last year, a reflection of how consumerism has been an important element in the Communist Party's economic restructuring. But now it seems spending money is almost the exception, not the rule. `` People are saving their money because the economy is getting worse and they see hard times ahead,'' said a woman office worker in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. She said the bonuses she receives on top of her salary have been sharply cut since the `` chaos'' _ the military crackdown on the pro-democracy movement last June _ and that many workers were now receiving no bonuses. Western economists say consumers have been reluctant to spend money for a couple of reasons. First, they have been hit with mandatory purchases of government bonds, imposed by the state to finance rising deficits. Second, banks are offering attractive interest rates to depositors to keep money out of circulation and help restrain inflation. Urban incomes were down 4 percent in October from a year earlier due to inflation and disappearing bonuses, state statistics show. The conservative leadership that has gained dominance since June also has imposed new `` luxury taxes'' on some consumer goods to dull the nation's appetite for items no longer deemed appropriate for plain-living socialists. A 20-inch color TV now sells for 3,000 yuan, or about $ 810, double a factory worker's annual income. The cost includes a new 600-yuan consumer tax and a 300-yuan tax to cover imported parts. Outwardly, the government is complacent about the decline in retail sales, saying it is a sacrifice that must be made to cool the economy and bring down inflation. The government's spending slashes and tight money policy begun a year ago have reduced inflation from 30 percent to less than 10 percent. <PERSON> Gong </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhaorong </PERSON>, a senior official in the <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, told the Chinese press recently that sales of durable goods are down because people are `` no longer worried about inflation and many people have already made major purchases during last year's panic buying'' that accompanied the rapid rise in prices Bank deposits nearly doubled in the first three quarters to 100 billion yuan, or about $ 27 billion, another sign that the government had reined in the wild spending habits of 1988. But economic retrenchment has come at a heavy price. Industrial output fell 2.1 percent in October, the first decline in the past decade of reforms. Tens of thousands of smaller factories, lacking credit to pay debts or buy raw materials, have stopped production. Major machinery and electronics businesses alone accrued losses of 769 million yuan, or about $ 208 million, in the first nine months of the year, and built up stockpiles worth 23.8 billion yuan, or about $ 6.4 billion, up 68.9 percent from a year earlier. Many factories, committed to rigid state plans that oblige them to meet certain quotas, have gone on producing and piling up inventories. Refrigerator production was up 13.4 percent through October even though sales were down at least 16 percent. Factories produced 7.5 million color TVs, up 5.8 percent, even though 2 million sets sat in warehouses. One Western economist said the current credit squeeze and suppression of consumer demand could have the desirable effect of driving producers of shoddy, low-quality goods out of business. But the economist said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> should use its current economic breathing space to restructure outmoded, inefficient industries. `` We do n't see any concrete things happening,'' she said. The official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said Chinese analysts are concerned that the huge buildup in savings represents a formidable purchasing potential. That could deluge the market again in a panic buying spree if consumers felt prices might start rising sharply. Despite the current lull in buying, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> still faces a voracious consumer market of 1.1 billion people where vast numbers of people still do not own two of the hottest `` desirables'' _ a television and a washing machine. Slackened demand already has brought down prices on many consumer goods. The price of a washing machine in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s bustling Wangfujing shopping district, for example, now is about 920 yuan, or $ 248, vs. 1,000 yuan in May A saleswoman at one supermarket said a bottle of <LOCATION> Maotai </LOCATION>, a much-prized sorghum liquor, was marked at only 92 yuan, or $ 25, down from 200 yuan a few months ago. `` Since the ` chaos,' people are unhappy at heart, so they are unwilling to spend so much,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 After a remarkably peaceful campaign, Chileans will choose a president Thursday for the first time in 16 years. The door then will open for the departure from the presidency of Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, who has ruled since the armed forces overthrew the government of <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allende </ORGANIZATION> in 1973. But it does not necessarily mean the 74-year-old general will fade away. The election is seen as a vote on the Pinochet legacy, and virtually all polls give the opposition a substantial lead over a right-wing candidate. But even <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s critics are accepting some of the many profound changes brought by the military leader. Three men are bidding to succeed Pinochet: _ <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, a 71-year-old law professor and former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> president, supported by a coalition of 17 moderate and leftist opposition parties _ <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>, 40, a former finance minister under <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> backed by right-wing forces _ <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Errazuriz </PERSON>, 47, a wealthy, conservative businessman Voters also will pick 38 senators and 120 members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' lower <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, a decisive step in the long road back to democracy If no one wins the presidential race by more than 50 percent of the vote, a runoff will be held in January or February for the two front-runners. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> has been given a commanding lead in virtually all pre-election surveys, and his two opponents acknowledge they are in a race against each other for the second runoff slot should <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> fail to win half the total vote. The new government is scheduled to take office March 11. Although the election is certain to bring radical changes to the political life of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s 12 million people, much of the free-market economic program crafted by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s administration is expected to remain intact. `` So far, our transition to democracy is the most peaceful, less traumatic in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and that's the result of a stable economy,'' said <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravinet </PERSON>, a close aide and spokesmen for <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>. `` That's why the platforms of all three candidates emphasize the need for political changes to rebuild democracy, while, despite some differences, agreeing on the need of maintaining an open economy,'' he said in an interview. Chileans pitched themselves enthusiastically into the first presidential campaign since 1970, when <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> won by a slim margin. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> toppled the Allende government in a bloody coup Sept. 11, 1973, during a period of social and political disorder. In the current campaign, street vendors in the main cities have been doing a brisk business selling lapel pins, cigarette lighters, pens, stickers, match boxes and other objects with the names and photos of the candidates. Noisy motorcades have toured the streets, especially on weekends, with thousands of followers, mostly young people, waving party flags and promoting their candidates. Hundreds of campaign rallies have been held throughout the country. A spokesman for the <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> campaign said the candidate made as many as 15 speeches in a single day. <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON> ended his campaign with a marathon, 11-stop tour up and down the 2,800-mile-long country. Radio stations enjoyed a financial bonanza broadcasting the candidates paid political advertising. Television time was limited to 20 free minutes daily divided among the three presidential candidates, and the same amount for congressional contenders. Authorities have reported only very sporadic and minor incidents of violence. There was little of the open tension that was evident when voters in an October 1988 referendum rejected a military proposal to extend <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s presidential term to 1997. That defeat forced <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to call this presidential election. The first years of <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s rule were marked by harsh repression of leftists. Many were tortured and killed, and thousands were forced into exile. Human rights groups here and abroad say they have documented about 750 cases of dissidents who disappeared after being arrested by secutity agents. Dealing with the emotional demands for justice for human rights violations during the <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> years will be one of the most sensitive problems facing the future government. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> has warned he will not allow trials of the military and that `` if one of my men is touched, the state of law will be broken.'' <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> has said he would deal with the problem `` combining the virtues of justice and prudence,'' and `` we will not seek revenge, but truth and justice.'' Even after handing over the presidency, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> will retain considerable power. He has vowed to remain as commander of the country's 60,000-man army until 1998, which is permitted by the constitution written by his government in 1980. The opposition, and even some moderate rightists and retired military officers, have called on <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to retire. Under <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s instruction, the army command across the street from the presidential palace is being refurbished, and <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s opponents fear it will be just one of several power bases he will continue to control His administration has been pushing through a series of last-minute laws that would limit the powers of the future government. `` As do all dictators, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> is trying to leave essential matters firmly tied up after his departure,'' said <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagos </PERSON>, a socialist and a leading opposition figure. One new law gives the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> autonomy in setting monetary and credit policies. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, however, agreed to include two opposition economists in the bank's five-member council. Another law allowed <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to create a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to control the issuing of TV broadcasting licenses. Yet to be passed is controversial legislation giving the military virtual independence. It prevents the government from cutting the defense budget, limits the presidenti's power to appoint commanders-in-chief and strips the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> of any right to approve the promotions of generals and admirals. The opposition has said it will work in the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to repeal or change those laws. <PERSON> Ravinet </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>'s spokesman, said one of the `` basic tasks'' of the new government will be `` to work in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> along with democratic forces, even right-wing ones, to change that legislation.'' Pre-election surveys give <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> 47 percent to 57 percent of the total vote. His principal threat comes from <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>, who is shown in the polls with 27 percent to 37 percent of the vote. The polls indicate <PERSON> Errazuriz </PERSON> has only a remote chance of capturing more than about 15 percent of the vote. <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON> is credited with the economic policies that have produced five years of growth, stability and low inflation and has won praise among bankers and businessmen at home and abroad. However, the economic bonanza does not seem to be helping his campaign, in which he tried to stress his independence from <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> after 12 years in his administration.

 Here are brief sketches of the candidates in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s presidential election:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> PATRICIO </PERSON> <PERSON> AYLWIN </PERSON> _ An ex-senador and former president of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest, <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> was nominated by an opposition alliance of 17 leftist and centrist political groups. Virtually every opinion poll gives him a commanding lead over his two opponents. At 71, he is the oldest candidate and was already a prominent politician when Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> seized power in a 1973 coup. Considered somewhat right-of-center, <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> initially supported the military takeover, but became disillusioned with <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s strong-arm tactics and reluctance to hand power back to civilians He gradually joined the ranks of the government's outspoken critics. He is known as an able negotiator with a low-key, conciliatory style, and he was the official spokesman for the opposition alliance when it successfully campaigned for the `` no'' vote in a referendum in October 1988, on a proposal that <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> remain president until 1997. That defeat forced <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to call elections to pick a successor. In the campaign <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> has pledged to re-establish full respect for human rights and civil liberties and to increase spending on social programs. He has said he plans no major changes in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s free-market economic program
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> HERNAN </PERSON> <PERSON> BUCHI </PERSON> _ <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s finance minister from 1985 until last May, <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON> is considered the principal architect of a free-market economy that has produced five years of steady growth and low inflation. <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>, 40, is an all-around athlete who runs several miles daily, climbs mountains and jumps horses. With a master's degree from <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s business school, he joined the <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> adminstration in 1975 as an Economy Ministry aide and rapidly ascended the bureaucratic ladder. He is considered highly intelligent but slightly eccentric. His trademark is a roughly trimmed page-boy haircut that once prompted <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to dub him `` my Prince Valiant.'' One of the slogans of his campaign has been `` Buchi is different.'' Despite an international reputation as an able technocrat, he entered the race as a political novice. Indeed, he withdrew for several weeks in May and June, declaring he was too shy to be a candidate. He returned, he said, because of a sense of patriotic duty. Backed by conservative businessmen and rightist political groups, he has campaigned as the `` can-do'' candidate. He has promised a million new jobs during the next four years and said he will spend more on health and education.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> FRANCISCO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> ERAZZURIZ </ORGANIZATION> _ From a prominent Chilean family that has produced several presidents, <PERSON> Errazuriz </PERSON> has dedicated most of his adult life to amassing wealth. The 47-year-old entrepreneur has built a commercial empire that consists of some 30 businesses including mining and fishing interests, automobile concessions, a fruit exporting company and a supermarket chain. All told, he employs about 8,000 workers. Characterized by his opponents as a populist, he has promised free health care and education to all Chileans. He is backed by a few small political groups. He describes himself as a `` centrist-centrist'' and says his candidacy offers Chileans an alternative to the traditional choice between leftist and rightist candidates. His nickname is `` Fra-Fra.'' One of his principal campaign slogans is `` No more bla-bla. Vote for Fra-Fra.''

<HEAD>Andrew Young Candidacy To Put New Formula to Test</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Looking back, black political analysts see two threads linking the major victories of 1989 _ seasoned candidates who came up the Democratic ladder the methodical, old-fashioned way, and campaign themes that de-emphasized race in favor of broader, mainstream issues. Looking ahead, they see <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. The two-term mayor of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> will test that strategy next year, a black candidate in quest of white votes to become governor of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. A month after the elections in which <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> chose a black governor, and black mayors were elected for the first time in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and three other cities with white voter majorities, the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> sponsored a forum on what those contests may tell future candidates. `` The next test is going to be <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>,'' said political scientist <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> II of <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Young's style and strategy reflect some of the winning ways shown by <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> this year. But political campaigns are not portable, and there are major differences, too. Young plays down the comparison, saying that except for the fact that all three of them went to <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, `` and we all happen to have the same skin color, there is n't a lot we have in common.'' One thing they have in common is a record to run on, political apprenticeships the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> analysts saw as vital ingredients in the black victories of 1989. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> has been in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> politics for 19 years; <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> has a 23-year record in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Among other black mayors elected last month, two were incumbents, two were state senators, two had long experience on city councils. `` In their political experience and their coalition approach, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> represent a growing trend among black politicians,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a visiting scholar at the Joint Center. `` An increasing number of them are becoming viable candidates for top positions by climbing the conventional political ladder.'' Young came to politics from the civil rights movement after serving as an aide to the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. He was elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, became <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, and has served two terms as mayor of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Another thread is the course the analysts called `` de-racialization,'' playing down what are seen as black issues in favor of themes that appeal to a broader constituency. Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Old </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dominion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said the <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> campaign was designed around issues without racial implications. He ran as a centrist, gaining vital votes for his support of abortion rights while at the same time advocating a balanced budget, supporting the death penalty and backing <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s right to work law. For <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, the issues were different but the style was similar, campaign aide <PERSON> Hulbert </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> said. Both candidates kept their distance from <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> during the fall campaign, although <PERSON> James </PERSON> said the political structure and cadre built for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 1988 presidential primary campaign was essential to the <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> organization. <PERSON> James </PERSON>, who also worked for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, counseled against de-emphasizing the black vote in the process of reaching out to white voters. That's a challenge for any politician trying to broaden his base by reaching out for new supporters without ignoring or offending old ones, especially for a black candidate seeking a breakthrough to white voters. In his effort to turn out black voters in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> appeared each Sunday in seven to 10 black churches, campaign visits he made with as little fanfare as possible, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. As Young begins his race for governor of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, there are parallels in both issues and strategy. Race obviously will be a factor, but it wo n't be an issue in the Young campaign; he is telling voters he can bring to <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> the kind of progress in economic development <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> has seen in the past eight years. His emphasis is on experience, qualifications and his record in office. Young boasts of his support in the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> business community. His campaign chairman is <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, the former attorney general, a white, conservative Democrat. <PERSON> Hobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Stripling </PERSON>, the former mayor of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, once president of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, is to manage his campaign. Young promises to go anywhere and talk to anyone to get his message across. As if to demonstrate, he dined one night last month at a redneck cafe in <LOCATION> Marietta </LOCATION>; for the occasion, the owner _ a supporter _ took two racist records off the jukebox. Young's recognition and approval ratings give him an early edge in what is likely to be a five-way Democratic primary next year. But he faces a major obstacle that did not confront <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, the likelihood of a runoff primary. Just under a quarter of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s voting age population is black. Young is a skilled and attractive campaigner. There's a good chance he will get more votes than any other Democrat in the primary, but the crowded ballot would make it unlikely any candidate could gain the 50 percent-plus that is needed for nomination without a runoff. And in a two-way Deep South race against a white candidate, the odds would be tougher. Win that, and he'd have to do it again next November against a white Republican. And if a centrist black candidate loses next time? <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> had an answer. `` One thing that's going to happen is <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s going to say ` I told you so.'''

 As the 1980s dawned, communism was on the march again, this time on the backs of Soviet soldiers entering <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was on his way to exile for saying it was wrong. As the decade closes, the red tide that <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> dreamed would cover the world appeared to be receding. Some even said that 72 years after the Bolshevik Revolution, the dream already had died, despite the determined efforts of a peasant's son from southern <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> to remake it for the 1990s. In the 1980s, years of official lies, brutality, empty store shelves and mind-boggling inefficiency caught up with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and then with its allies. Promising paradise for the laboring masses, Soviet-style socialism could not save three out of four potatoes from rotting before they reached the plate. Meanwhile, the West prospered. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s selection as <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief on March 11, 1985, divided the decade between the cozy downward spiral of <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> and his proteges, and a revolution in the revolution. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> exorcised from Soviet hearts the terror of the midnight knock on the door. He declared <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and materialism, the ideology could not exploit that world view for the good of the working man. <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s revolution, said <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Pestov </PERSON>, a 23-year-old <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> worker, `` was just a seizure of power by one party, the <ORGANIZATION> Bolsheviks </ORGANIZATION>, and nobody else needed it.'' A East German man watched police beat people trying to jump aboard a train to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` I saw them beat children,'' he said. `` That was when my wife and I decided to leave.'' British communist <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> said the system that regarded itself as the deepest expression of the laws of history had been `` overtaken by history.'' Defenders of the system claimed that it could be reformed. `` I do n't think socialism is kaput,'' said <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>, named in mid-October 1989 to reform <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` I think the disfigurements of socialism are kaput.'' But several weeks later, <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> himself was kaput, swept away by the party on the same day it expelled <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, the Czechoslovak communist leader whose reforms were crushed by Soviet tanks in 1968, could stand before a half-million people on <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s Wenceslas Square 21 years later and proclaim, `` The ideals of democracy, freedom and humanity live on.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> acknowledged the events of the 1980s as the fruit of communism's stormy history. `` Our past defies a simple, straightforward interpretation,'' the Soviet leader said. But he conceded, `` This country has failed to create for its people the conditions of life which are natural for a civilized state.'' A few Soviet politicians proposed the heretical _ to remove <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s body from its Red Square mausoelum and bury it. But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> kept faith in the dynamism of Leninism to direct the world on a new path of using the scientific revolution for the benefit of all. `` The idea of socialism as we understand it today is, above all, the idea of freedom,'' he said. His foreign minister and close adviser, <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, said the era of worldwide struggle with capitalism was over. `` As for the question of which of the two existing social systems will ... prove to be the best in giving people greater freedom and well-being,'' he said, `` let us leave that for future generations to decide.''

<HEAD>A Mounting Toll: Victims of a Plague</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 It was the great untold story of the 1980s. Or was it in the newspaper every day? Suddenly, an unusual number of people in their prime were dying _ `` after a long illness,'' their obituaries often said. Though frequently written with respect for personal or family wishes, the vague death notices deflected early public attention from a toll that would mount to almost 70,000 Americans, victims of a virus, discovered only in 1983, that infected an estimated 6 million to 8 million people worldwide by the end of the'80s. Halfway through the decade, the death of movie star Rock Hudson personalized for many Americans what had been a faceless plague, seemingly limited to `` risk groups'' of homosexual men, hemophiliacs and intravenous drug users. By then, the infections and cancers that could drastically shorten the lives of those infected with the virus had a name, acquired immune deficiency syndrome _ AIDS. Quickly, other well-known names in the arts and public life were drawn into the patchwork of torn lives symbolized by an immense quilt spread in front of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Monument. Just as the quilt has grown too large to be shipped around the country for display, the roster of the dead can only be represented symbolically by this short list:

<HEAD>Scientific Camps Still Sorting Out Cholesterol</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As Americans wend their way through the season of holiday goodies and then decide what diet to choose for the New Year, they face a smorgasbord of scientific updates and debate over cholesterol. A 2-year-old government campaign to get people interested in knowing how much of the fatty substance is in their arteries has made cholesterol a popular topic from cocktail parties to medical-screening booths in shopping malls. Researchers are releasing new studies detailing how excess cholesterol _ an essential building block of cell membranes, sex hormones and Vitamin D _ in the blood clogs vessels and causes heart attacks. Food manufacturers are devising new products to capitalize on the findings, splashing `` cholesterol-free'' banners across items ranging from cupcakes to peanut butter, which never contained cholesterol anyway. News media have kept the public's curiosity piqued with the views of a small but vocal group of critics, including scientists. They say the public is being frightened needlessly, many people wo n't benefit from the low-cholesterol diets, and money is wasted to try to get <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to change the way it eats. How bad is cholesterol? How hard should people work to avoid it? And how much will that help increase their chances of living longer? Researchers have spent hundreds of millions of federal dollars trying to answer those questions; many top scientists are convinced of the results. `` The evidence linking elevated blood cholesterol to coronary heart disease is overwhelming,'' a group of them said recently in a statement by the American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the National Heart, Lung and <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. Population studies, clinical trials, genetic tests and animal experiments show that high levels of blood cholesterol clog arteries and increase the risk of heart disease, they said, adding clinical trials show lowering cholesterol levels by diet or drugs decreases subsequent occurrence of heart disease. `` The direct evidence ... is strongest in middle-aged men with high initial cholesterol levels,'' but also strongly suggests cutting cholesterol is likely `` to decrease coronary heart disease incidence in younger and older men, in women, and in persons with more moderate cholesterol levels,'' they said. Two of the largest studies to date suggest that a 1 percent reduction in blood cholesterol translates into a 2 percent reduction in the risk of developing coronary heart disease, they added. Those studies _ the <ORGANIZATION> Coronary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Primary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trial </ORGANIZATION>, involving more than 3,800 middle-aged men, and the Framingham Heart Study of over 5,000 women and men _ have been supported by others suggesting greater benefit, they said. However, critics of the anti-cholesterol campaign contend it has misled people by excluding mention of other major contributors to heart disease, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s No. 1 killer, which claims more than 500,000 lives a year. One critic, Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, professor of medicine and pharmacological science at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Stony </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>, says only about 20 percent of a person's heart-disease risk is attributable to blood cholesterol. An estimated 40 percent is hereditary and the rest is due to other causes, chiefly smoking and high blood pressure, he said. `` We think there's too much hype in the marketplace and even in these educational agencies. Everybody's sort of afraid of their food and afraid of their cholesterol, often without medical surveillance.'' Dr. <PERSON> Fredrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stare </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> nutrition professor emeritus and co-author of `` Balanced Nutrition: Beyond the Cholesterol Scare,'' agrees. `` We do n't think the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cholesterol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> gives enough attention to other risk factors that are more important _ smoking, high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, lack of a reasonable amount of activity and stress.'' Dr. <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Corday </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, past president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cardiology </ORGANIZATION>, said he objects to cholesterol-lowering efforts for people over 65. `` Over 65, there's no proof there's any benefit,'' said <PERSON> Corday </PERSON>, formerly a member of the advisory council to the National Heart, Lung and <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, where he felt `` very, very outnumbered'' by ardent cholesterol opponents. Elderly patients `` try very hard not to touch a bit of cholesterol,'' <PERSON> Corday </PERSON> said, even though `` it's a damn fool thing to stop eating eggs and meat when they need the nutrition. They get anemic.'' The <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION> recommended in February that checking family histories for heart attacks is more important than cholesterol testing, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON>, professor of medicine at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. `` I agree with them. If a lot of people in the family did n't have heart attacks, you're not going to have one. Cholesterol testing becomes appropriate if the family history suggests a genetic tendency to heart attack, he said. Cholesterol-modifying efforts should begin only if blood levels are high for so-called `` bad cholesterol'' _ LDL, or low-density lipoprotein _ and low for so-called `` good cholesterol'' _ HDL, or high-density lipoprotein. <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Corday </PERSON> and <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> were on a panel assembled in September by the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, a consumer education group partly funded by the food industry, to offset what they call the cholesterol `` scare.'' Part of their message was that only 15 percent of the population have blood-cholesterol levels putting them clearly at greater risk for heart attacks. That level is generally agreed to be 240 milligrams per deciliter of blood, and people testing that high `` should be seeing a physician ... They should not be self-medicating themselves'' with diet changes, said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whelan </PERSON>, the council's president. Besides, lowering cholesterol dietarily is difficult at best and impossible for many; not everyone responds the same way. Confusion also prevails about what to modify in the diet, with undue emphasis placed on cholesterol, <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> said. `` We make three times as much cholesterol from dietary fat as from dietary cholesterol. Too much -LRB- dietary -RRB- cholesterol is not the culprit. Too much saturated fat is the culprit.'' Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRosa </PERSON>, chairman of the task force on cholesterol issues for the American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, says critics `` are not really saying anything different'' from the government scientists. Their guidelines are unchanged since being introduced two years ago as part of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cholesterol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, which recommends that all adults learn their blood-cholesterol level and aim for a level below 200 milligrams per deciliter of blood. Those with levels of 200-239 are considered borderline high, not requiring treatment unless they have two other traits that increase their risk for heart disease, including hereditary tendency and being male. People who head for shopping malls or other public places to get their cholesterol checked should be wary, though. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> said last month that such screenings can be inaccurate, pose health risks and frequently fail to provide counseling or physician referral. Those with confirmed levels of 240 or above are at high risk and should get HDL and LDL testing. If warranted, treatment should begin with diet and exercise, and should proceed to drugs only if that approach fails. The scientific basis for the guidelines `` is probably more solid than for any public health venture that I know of,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, a professor of medicine at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> was chairman of the federal 1984 <ORGANIZATION> Concensus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> panel that gave rise to the assault on cholesterol. `` It has been tremendously effective in bringing in people who have been previously unwilling to listen to lifestyle modifications,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> board member. Seventeen European nations in 1987 reached the same conclusions as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> panel, and the Canadians did so later, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said. `` This is not sort of an off-the-wall conclusion by Americans who are gung-ho against cholesterol.''

<HEAD>Restoration Ecology: Turning Back the Clock on Nature</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Leaving nature to repair itself wo n't counter the damage caused by people, say park managers hoping to restore the grassy marshes and hardwood hammocks of the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> to their turn-of-the-century condition If nature were allowed to take its course in <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, the hardy melaleuca tree, an Australian invader, could take over and displace every native plant _ already the condition in some tracts near the park's borders. Proponents of restoration ecology call it the park management philosophy of the future, and say park managers abdicated their responsibility when they left <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, for example, to recover from fires that damaged more than two-fifths of the 2.2 million-acre park. `` Basically they're doing nothing,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonnicksen </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M professor who recently lectured to a group of Everglades scientists. `` By and large, they're standing back and proclaiming every little blade of grass that comes up a masterpiece of God's work. `` Restoration is nothing more than looking back at what we had when we set the areas aside,'' he said. `` In many cases, particularly in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the national parks resemble very little what they were when they were set aside. `` Our goal is to replace and increase the biological diversity on this planet that we've lost, and we are convinced that simply declaring places as reserves, putting fences around them and standing back and watching them is going to lead to a reduction in biological diversity because the areas around the preserve are ignored and the areas in the preserve are degraded.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> sees `` a lot of value in some of the principles'' of ecological restoration, said spokesman <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. For example, the agency is trying to eject some unwanted, non-native animals _ notably burros in the Grand Canyon and <LOCATION> Death </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and European wild boar in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Smoky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON> said. `` Some of the major intrusions which seem to be susceptible to management we have already undertaken to remove. Others we are looking at finding ways that might work. `` You'd have to temper what seem to be desirable goals with some sense of what can, in fact, be accomplished.'' Restoration ecology is practiced most commonly on a small scale, on grasslands, wetlands, lakes and forest tracts. But the Canadian park service adopted the concept for its sprawling <ORGANIZATION> Banff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Bonnicksen </PERSON>, a director of the 1,200-member, 18-month-old Society for Ecological Restoration. In choosing a target date as a guide to what a restored park should look like, 1900 has been a common reference point for the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>. `` What is it that we really want to do? Until we can put this down straight in our minds, we're going to flounder,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gann-Matzen </PERSON>, who grew up on the edge of the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>, worked in the park and now is a consulting restoration ecologist. Tree ring studies, soil chemistry, old photographs, historic land surveys, an analysis of pollen and charcoal fragments in pond sediment and other methods offer clues to the type and prevalence of vegetation at a given point in time. Restoration work can involve anything from planting vegetation that was known to be in a disturbed area at the benchmark date to managing lightning fires to leave a historic blend of trees. At the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>, hydrologists tinkering with water delivery for 10 years have been trying to re-create a natural rainfall-driven system they hope will bring wading birds, alligators, panthers, deer and fish to old haunts. `` It's a tradeoff. The alligator prefers deeper water conditions than the wading bird,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, the park's hydrologic program manager. `` The idea is to come up with some range of hydrologic conditions.'' The Nature Conservancy estimates a minimum $ 10 per acre for minor restoration, <PERSON> Gann-Matzen </PERSON> said. His firm charges $ 100 per acre, and highly disturbed areas cost $ 10,000 to $ 15,000 an acre to reach a maintenance condition, which then requires regular followup. Restoration may be more attractive in the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> than other parks because the signs of trouble _ a stunning drop in wading birds and threats to numerous animal and plant species _ are obvious, <PERSON> Bonnicksen </PERSON> said. `` The changes that take place in the forest are not as easily seen by the untrained eye as the changes that take place in a place like the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>.'' If restoration ecology is pursued in the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>, he said, `` It may in fact turn out to be the first national park that actually is managed to restore its historic integrity, and it may serve as a model for other national parks.''

<HEAD>Federal Lab Develops Devices to Track Bees</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OAK RIDGE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Behind the security gates at <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, researchers are quietly preparing for an invasion. They've come up with one device to tell friend from foe and another to track the enemy. The invaders began their advance about 40 years ago and now are massing in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for a final assault expected some time next year. No need to hustle down to the gun shop _ these invaders are aggressive Africanized bees, sometimes known as `` killer bees'' because they have killed animals and people. They've also disrupted honeybee colonies. Researchers at the federal laboratory here have developed a hand-held sensor that can distinguish between the tamer domestic honeybees and their more aggressive cousins, and a prototype of a device to track the Africanized bees using a solar-powered, infared-pulsating, microchip bee backpack. Neither device falls directly into the work done by the nuclear engineers and electronics specialists at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> lab </ORGANIZATION>. But they were intrigued by parallels with their work in connection with radiation monitoring. The $ 339 noise sensor, dubbed a `` Buzz <PERSON> Buster </PERSON>,'' is ready for market, said engineer <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON>, who developed it largely in his spare time. `` I've been to <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> twice and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> once with this thing and it works like a top.'' <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON>, an amateur beekeeper, got started a few years ago when told by a federal agricultural official that for some unexplained reason the Africanized bees that were released from a Brazilian lab make a louder sound in flight. The resulting <PERSON> Buzz </PERSON> <PERSON> Buster </PERSON> allows monitoring of a bee colony from a distance to determine whether there are any Africanized bees buzzing inside. While working on the Buzz <PERSON> Buster </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ker </PERSON> called in <PERSON> Chip </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> bee expert, who said what researchers needed was a way to track bees, particularly during mating. That sparked the idea for the microchip backpack. After a year of research and $ 100,000 in seed money from the lab, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>'s team has developed a transmitter about one-fourth the size of a postage stamp that sends an infrared beam more than a 1 kilometer. An 8-inch telescope with a special sensor detects the beam, which ca n't be seen by the naked eye. Alley allows that the transmitter, at about 65 milligrams, is still 15 milligrams too heavy for a bee to carry, and work on a computerized tracking system has n't even begun. But `` I think we have proven the concept,'' he said. `` There are certainly some refinements that need to be made. But I think the concept is feasible. `` Today, I could n't give you a field demonstration of putting one on a bee. But several major hurdles have been crossed.'' But he said the hardest work has already been done, and the main job now is to get more funding to carry on. `` We've gotten interest from a broad spectrum of agencies, none of whom are interested in honeybees,'' <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON> lamented. `` There's a lot of things that people would like to be able to track with a very inconspicuous transmitter attached to it.'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> thinks the transmitters might be used for equipment inventories aboard spacecraft, and there have been inquiries from people who would like to use the microchip to track animals, birds and insects, <PERSON> Alley </PERSON> said. There also has been interest from the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and `` how would you characterize it? _ the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. Even if the transmitter is n't ready by the time the Africanized bees reach the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said, it will be developed eventually because of the number of possible applications. `` This is a technology that has to come along. If it does n't come along right now, it's got to come along in the future.''

<HEAD>Scientist Develops Process To Clear Up Blurry Pictures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A computerized process to sharpen blurry photos by breaking them into millions of pieces and reassembling them could be a boon not only to family albums but also to police who use photographs to solve crimes. State police used <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murat </PERSON> <PERSON> Tekalp </PERSON>'s process when they investigated the death of a 7-year-old boy who was struck by a vehicle while he was camping out on a hill behind his home. The only evidence was a faint trace of tire marks on the boy's tent. Police clarified the photographs and concluded that the boy was struck by his father's pickup truck. The case has not gone to trial, but state police Investigator <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> said the process was essential. There are `` dozens of scenarios'' in which it could be used, such as photographs of license plates, documents and vehicles, said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s special photographic unit in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` If you've got one big case it works on, it's golden,'' he said Tekalp, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION> electrical engineering professor, has only developed the process for still photographs, but he said moving pictures are his next subject. The computer process uses a high-resolution scanner to divide a negative into more than 2 million pixels. Calculations then are made about what caused the blur, the computer sorts the information and produces a clearer image, and then a new negative is made.

<HEAD>Scientists Show How Acid Rain Kills Red Spruces</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nitric and sulfuric acids in rain are killing mountain forests in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> by damaging the foliage _ crippling photosynthesis _ and by upsetting trees' nutritional balance, a researcher says. `` This finding is a surprise because sulfuric acid from acid rain was shown in previous studies to be harmless to crop plants,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>, who based his findings on five years of field and greenhouse experiments. `` We have demonstrated that sulfuric acid at concentrations similar to those found in acidic mist and cloud-water seriously weakens the foliage, thus impairing the tree's photosynthetic process. At high concentrations, it kills the needles outright,'' said <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>, a plant physiologist at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Boyce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thompson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. While sulfuric acid destroyed the foliage, nitric acid _ a form of nitrogen fertilizer _ upset the trees' balance of nutrients, he said. `` All plants need nutrients from the soil to grow. If we give them too much of one nutrient such as nitrogen fertilizer from the atmosphere and not enough of others the trees would develop chronic nutritional deficiencies, a factor detrimental to the health of the affected tree in the long run.'' Scientists have long suspected that acid precipitation has been the cause of mountain forest decline. Red spruce, which grow at high elevations across the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, are important for the pulp and paper industries. Sulfuric acid is formed in the atmosphere when sulfur oxides from the combustion of coal and oil undergo chemical reactions. Nitric acid is produced by internal combustion engines and from the combustion of oil and coal. <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>'s findings will be published next year in the <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, the Water, Air and Soil Pollution Journal, and Physiologia Plantarum in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>.

 When <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> pulled a whopper rainbow trout from the <LOCATION> Elkhorn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> last summer, his state-record catch spawned an idea. Officials marveled that the 11-pound, 3-ounce beauty thrived in springwater fed in part by an abandoned coal mine, and want to make it a fish hatchery. `` Trout are extremely fragile,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamrick </PERSON>, director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>. `` They need so many factors in order for them to perpetuate themselves naturally.'' `` Most people, when they think of a coal mine, do n't think of a hatchery,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Phares </PERSON>, state assistant chief of cold water fisheries. Good sites for trout hatcheries are hard to find because many count on natural springs for water, <PERSON> Phares </PERSON> said. He and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahall </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> mining and natural resources subcommittee, insist water conditions at some old coal mines are just right to produce the big Water draining from coal mines is usually very acid because of the residue of high-sulfur coal. The mine that feeds the <LOCATION> Elkhorn </LOCATION> was always low in sulfur. <PERSON> Phares </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rahall </PERSON> refused to name the mine or give its location until it can be purchased. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will take up the project next year; it must approve $ 2.5 million to buy the mine and build the hatchery. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> would build the hatchery, with a series of concrete runways eight feet wide by 100 long to produce up to 200,000 fish a year, <PERSON> Phares </PERSON> said. The mine drainage would be recirculated, with some outside water added for volume. The prototype hatchery could spawn new life for many old mines, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Zoia </PERSON>, staff director of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. `` There's a lot of potential in the Appalachian area. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, vice president of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s southern chapter of Trout Unlimited, said there are high hopes for the hatchery `` Being a big trout fisherman, I think it's needed and it could very well turn out to be a big economic boost to <LOCATION> McDowell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Conference Board: Consumer Confidence Off in November</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Consumer confidence in the economy fell in November but remains relatively strong, the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said. A survey of 5,000 households nationwide showed that buying plans for houses and cars are soft and that Americans are slightly less optimistic about their expectations for the economy in the coming months. The <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s consumer confidence index, released Wednesday, registered 114.4 for November, the lowest since November 1988. Twenty-six percent of survey participants said current business conditions are good, down from 28 percent in October and the lowest level in more than a year. But the percentage who thought the economy was bad also fell, to 15.3 percent from 16.9 percent. Respondents' outlook for economic conditions six months from now showed 17.4 percent thought conditions would improve, the lowest since April. In a separate report, the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said the volume of help-wanted advertising in 51 major newspapers increased in October. The group said want-ad volume was rising in 69 percent of the newspapers, compared with 55 percent in September and 35 percent in August 1988, but down from 84 percent a year ago. The board's help-wanted advertising index rose to 150 from 148 in September, but was down sharply from 161 a year ago. `` There is no question that labor market activity is slowing down, as is the economy in general,'' <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> said. `` The data on want-ad volume suggests that while the labor market is cooling off we are not on the verge of a recession.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> is a non-profit business organization that conducts economic research and provides forums for businesses to exchange information.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has sharply criticized a major credit-rating company for reportedly telling wholesalers to stop shipping merchandise to <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s department stores _ an action that could do severe damage to the chains. The criticism came in a letter Wednesday from <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> executive <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bradstreet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Moritz </PERSON>. A copy of the letter, which was dispatched in response to a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> article, was made public by Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in Wednesday editions that <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bradstreet </ORGANIZATION> had informed its clients that it no longer was advising them to ship goods to retailers owned by the Canadian retail and property company. The newspaper quoted <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bradstreet </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Doscher </PERSON> as saying the company `` is no longer providing guidelines on shipments to the <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> stores to our clients.'' He declined to elaborate, the Times said. Calls late Wednesday seeking comment from <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bradstreet </ORGANIZATION> were n't immediately returned. Goods for the peak holiday shopping season are already stocked in <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s 140 stores around the country, including <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s, <LOCATION> Burdines </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Goldsmiths </ORGANIZATION>'s, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>'s. But if manufacturers hold back on further shipments of clothing, home furnishings and other items, Campeau-owned stores could be short of spring merchandise. Previously, <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Bradstreet </PERSON> advised manufacturers that they could sell each of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> divisions as much as $ 250,000 worth of merchandise at wholesale cost. But the Times said <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Bradstreet informed manufacturers by telephone on Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s financial situation looked bleak because it had n't received any formal bids for <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s, the 17-store upscale chain that <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> has put up for sale to generate much-needed cash. <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bradstreet </ORGANIZATION> also reportedly mentioned the interest payments <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> owes early next year on its heavy debts as a reason for concern. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, chief financial officer of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> and Allied, said <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bradstreet </ORGANIZATION>'s advisory was based on `` wholly inaccurate and misleading information _ information that ... has the potential for doing considerable harm to our business.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Bradstreet should have contacted <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> to get the facts before altering its position. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> suppliers so far have been very supportive despite a `` preponderance of market rumors and the uncertainty created by the spread of misinformation ...'' The actions reportedly taken by <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Bradstreet are `` professionally irresponsible and entirely inexcusable,'' he said. Plans for the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s are on schedule, he said. Friday is the deadline by which initial bids must be submitted and <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> has received expressions of interest from numerous parties. `` In fact, the process for the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s is moving along exactly on schedule,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said in the letter. `` Further, we have every reason to believe that the sale of <PERSON> Bloomingdale </PERSON>'s will be concluded satisfactorily, and within the publicly stated timeframe, which anticipates definitive action in the early part of next year,'' he said. The head of <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s, <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Traub </PERSON>, has said he would like to lead a buyout of the chain but there has n't been any indication that he has secured adequate financial support for his plan. <PERSON> Traub </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> last week and said he had `` serious, constructive conversations with parties'' that may join in a possible buyout. Another party that has publicly disclosed an interest in <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s is Crown <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a privately held company that is one of the country's major shopping mall developers and owns the <ORGANIZATION> Hess </ORGANIZATION>'s department store chain.

<HEAD>Fed Sold Dollars Heavily In August-October Period</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> spent nearly $ 6 billion from August through October to stem the dollar's rise and keep the currency in the trading range set with other major industrialized nations, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> reported. The quarterly foreign-exchange report released Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> showed the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> sold $ 5.871 billion in exchange for West German marks and Japanese yen during the three months ended Oct. 31. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the government sold a total of $ 3.289 billion for Japanese yen and $ 2.582 billion for West German marks. The move, the government's second-largest unloading of dollars ever in a three-month period, comes on the heels of the record-setting sale of $ 11.92 billion in the quarter ended July 31. The dollar initially got a boost during the August-October quarter from a spate of favorable economic data. Because of the figures, which indicated the economy was not as sluggish as previously believed, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> was not inclined to push interest rates lower _ which kept returns relatively attractive on dollar-denominated securities. Gains in retail sales and employment and a better-than-expected trade report helped boost the dollar to its high during the period of 2.00 West German marks and 148.98 Japanese yen on Sept. 15. But a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> industrial nations in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> later that month produced a sharply worded statement criticizing the dollar's rise. The group _ which includes the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> _ favors a relatively weaker dollar, which is seen as helping reduce the huge <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. The Group of Seven called the dollar's rise inconsistent with long-run fundamentals'' and said a further rise could `` adversely affect prospects for the world economy.'' The bulk of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s intervention, which was coordinated with other leading central banks, occurred in the weeks leading up to the G-7 meeting and in several weeks following the gathering. `` Activities after the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> G-7 </ORGANIZATION> meeting -RRB- were forceful,'' said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Y </PERSON>. Cross, a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> executive vice president who presented the report to reporters. `` We did act quite forcefully to reinforce the policy statement'' of the group. `` Since that time the dollar has trended downward,'' <PERSON> Cross </PERSON> said. By early October the dollar had plunged to 1.8650 West German marks and 138.60 Japanese yen. By mid-October, the upward pressure on the dollar had fully eased. Interest rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> _ traditionally far lower than <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rates _ were higher, thereby shrinking the advantage the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had in terms of return to investors and reducing demand for dollars. Furthermore, more recent reports indicated sluggishness in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy that raised speculation the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might ease credit to help prevent a recession. The spotlight shifted to foreign currencies, particularly the mark, which was bolstered by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s bright economic prospects and the beginnings of a massive reform movement in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The dollar now is trading at about 1.76-1 .77 marks and 143-144 yen Currency traders are often keenly aware of the activities of central banks in the open markets, but the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s policy is to comment only well after the fact. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> does not provide any data on intervention by foreign central banks.

 Publishing and information services giant <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is trimming more than 1,000 jobs, or 7 percent of its full-time positions, and taking a big charge against its earnings in a cost-cutting realignment.

The company did not specify where the job eliminations would be, but indicated many would be corporate positions rather than in operating units, which include <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Week </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's debt rating service. `` The effort to improve productivity and make the organization leaner is a step in the right direction,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Appert </PERSON>, a media analyst for <PERSON> C.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grenfell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. But he said the company should do more. `` Operating margins in some of their units are low by industry standards,'' <PERSON> Appert </PERSON> said, citing TV station operations and some information services units. He said the stock market's negative reaction to the announcement would do nothing to discourage speculation that the company may be a takeover target. <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> said it would deduct $ 220 million from its pre-tax earnings, or $ 152 million after taxes, in the fourth quarter for writing down the value of assets, including those at its DRI-McGraw-Hill economic forecasting unit. The charge also reflects the closing of a unit that publishes general-interest books and the establishment of a reserve for employee severance payments. Several publishing companies recently have taken writedowns, including <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jovanovich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Schuster. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> recently agreed to sell its <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foresman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> textbook division for less than it paid for it three years ago and expects to take a pretax charge of $ 175 million on the deal. <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> said it would scrap its current internal structure of three operating companies _ publishing, financial services and information services _ and have all operations report to two new corporate executive vice presidents responsible to <PERSON> Dionne </PERSON>. One new executive vice president is <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGraw </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, great-grandson of the company's founder. <PERSON> McGraw </PERSON> is in charge of overseeing the financial services, Business Week and broadcasting groups and the aerospace and defense information units. He had been head of financial services. The other, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Serwatka </PERSON>, will be responsible for divisions that provide information on the construction industry, education, law, computers and communications. He also will oversee the professional publishing group. He had headed information services. `` Adopting this streamlined corporate structure eliminates an entire layer of staffing and related expenses associated with the three operating companies,'' <PERSON> Dionne </PERSON> said in a statement. The rest of the jobs being eliminated will result from previously disclosed plans to automate delivery of the F.W. <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> reports on the construction industry and from corporate staff reductions, spokesman <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Trisler </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> employs about 13,700 people, meaning the reductions would amount to a 7 percent cut in staffing. The company earned $ 54.97 million, or $ 1.13 a share, on revenue of $ 507.4 million in the fourth quarter of 1988. It earned $ 185.5 million, or $ 3.83 a share, on revenue of $ 1.82 billion for all of 1988.

<HEAD>Fed Says Economy Stable to Expanding Modestly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic activity ranged from stable to expanding modestly last month, although the manufacturing sector showed signs of weakness, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said in a report that provided no damaging news about inflation. In its latest survey of economic conditions, the central bank said Wednesday that only two of its 12 districts showed `` some recent softening'' in the economy. The districts were not named, but summaries provided by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> indicated they were the ones based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. `` Consumer spending has varied among districts,'' the survey showed. `` Strength has been mostly confined to nondurable items, while sales of autos and other durables have generally been weak.'' Higher interest rates have dampened sales of durable goods _ big-ticket items expected to last more than three years _ because such items often are financed through borrowing. `` The majority of districts report some softening in manufacturing activity but there are pockets of strength,'' The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Construction is strong or improving in the West and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> but somewhat sluggish in other areas.'' Referring to inflation, the report said `` those districts that reported on price developments generally noted flat to modestly increased input prices, with several mentioning the continuing escalation of medical insurance costs.'' The survey by the 12 district banks was conducted prior to Nov. 28 in preparation for the Dec. 18 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. As the central bank's monetary policy-setting arm, the committee sets goals for monetary growth which in turn govern interest rates. It was the tighter monetary policies that pushed up interest rates recently as the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> sought to restrain inflation. The manufacturing and housing industries were most affected by the tight-money policies, although the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has eased its grip recently and the housing industry has picked up as mortgage rates fell. Retail sales were described as on target or healthy in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> districts and unchanged in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> noted some softening. `` Some slowing in manufacturing activity has occurred in most areas,'' the survey showed. `` Weakness in the auto industry and among its suppliers was the most commonly cited as a major factor in the manufacturing slowdown.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> survey showed agriculture improving in much of the country, although drought was reported in south <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and along the Gulf coast. It also reported increased natural gas exploration in the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> district and said the oil and gas industry is optimistic about expanding in the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> district next year. Loan demand at commercial banks, the survey said, varied by type and region. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> region, hit by the strong earthquake in October, `` reports strong loan demand in most areas though the rate of growth seems to have slowed from its earlier robust pace,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> reported.

<HEAD>US to Protect Banks Against Long-Term Foreign Risks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal <ORGANIZATION> Export-Import </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> says it is willing to protect private banks against political violence and other risks in countries where they make loans to support purchases of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods. The bank did not specify any countries in its announcement Wednesday. The new guarantee could be given to lenders to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other East European countries if, as many business people hope, laws are repealed that limit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to those nations. In the past, the bank required the borrowing government to make a guarantee against financial loss from violence and foreign government actions when the money was lent over five years or more for a government purchase. Private projects required a guarantee from a private bank in the borrowing country. On loans made for less than five years, the <LOCATION> Export-Import </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> has sometimes covered political risks. On Tuesday the bank told its <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that there have been several requests that it take over the long-term political guarantee. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Macomber </PERSON>, the bank's president, said he expected there will be many more such requests in the future. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Frey </PERSON>, a press officer at the bank, explained that this was because projects in some countries that had been delayed by international debt problems are now being brought up again. Foreign governments are unwilling to take on the risk of additional debt themselves, she suggested. She said requests for the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> guarantees have come from <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and some Latin American countries. An Export-Import Bank guarantee often makes the difference in closing a deal. Other governments of industrial countries, especially <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, compete vigorously for international orders. Political risks include war, rebellion, confiscation, nationalization and the refusal of a foreign government to allow payments to leave its country. The bank said the new long-term guarantees will be available after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and the borrowing government have made an agreement that provides a way to settle disputes. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> already offers similar insurance to Americans who make direct investments, not loans, in other countries. Some governments, especially in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, have been reluctant to make agreements on dispute settlement because they are unwilling to see trade disputes handled anywhere but in their own courts.

<HEAD>Eastern Objects to Methods Used in Investigation of Finances</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An extensive financial investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> being made under the supervision of a federal bankruptcy court has raised objections from the airline. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boies </PERSON>, an attorney for Eastern, told <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> at a hearing Wednesday that the investigation's objectivity has been compromised because a large part of the work has been delegated to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unions Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, the examiner appointed by the bankruptcy court, has been conducting the inquiry into <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and their parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> since early September. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> and more than 20 associates have been interviewing current and former officers of the companies, union leaders and others. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> told <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> he has received a list of complaints from <LOCATION> Boies </LOCATION> which contend, among other things, that the investigation has been `` too tough'' and `` too prosecutorial.'' The examiner said the magnitude of the task has led him to delegate some work, such as interviews, to union attorneys but that practice has n't hurt objectivity. Also at the hearing, <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> postponed for two months consideration of a union request for a special trustee to be appointed to run Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> postponed from Dec. 15 to Feb. 15 a hearing on the trustee issue, in accordance with a request by <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>. He also gave <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> until Feb. 15 to submit a report on his investigation. `` It's clear that the underlying examinations are proceeding with vigor, with a great deal of discomfort,'' <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> said. The unions at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> had asked that a trustee be appointed to run the airline in place of current management soon after they went on strike on March 4. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> has postponed hearings on the question several times since then. Union attorneys objected Wednesday to <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>'s request that the trustee issue be put off again, but they agreed that he needed more time to complete his inquiry. Attorneys for Eastern's major creditors supported both of <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>'s requests. Eastern filed for bankruptcy protection on March 9 and has been rebuilding as a smaller airline by hiring workers to replace the striking Machinists, pilots and flight attendants. Contract talks are ongoing between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and its pilots and flight attendants unions, which decided to end their 8 1 @ 2-month sympathy strikes shortly before Thanksgiving. The <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union is still on strike against the airline. The unions have accused <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> of stripping assets from Eastern. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> is looking into past transactions between <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and sister carrier <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. They include, for example, the transfer of the System One computer reservation system from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> in April 1987 for about $ 100 million. The key question is whether <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has been treating the three companies as one airline, <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> told the court. He and his staff have interviewed around 70 people and examined more than 200,000 documents, he said. In October, <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> had said he expected to complete the investigation by early December, and said his schedule had been delayed several times by lawyers for the parties involved.

<HEAD>Raise MaxSaver Fares; Temporarily Drop Advance-Purchase Requirements</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 While they are raising discount MaxSaver fares, the nation's big airlines are softening the blow by eliminating advance-purchase requirements for the popular tickets during the holiday period. Following a move a week ago by <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a number of airlines said Wednesday they plan to raise MaxSavers by $ 10 per round trip on flights of less than 1,000 miles and $ 20 on longer trips. The new fares take effect Dec. 16. Spokesmen for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> said those carriers had decided after a week of deliberation to match <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s increases Most of the airlines also are following <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s initiative in temporarily dropping advance-purchase requirements for the MaxSavers, the most deeply discounted fares popular with vacationers. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest carrier, moved Tuesday to match <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s change. American's new MaxSaver fares between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, for example, will be $ 398 to $ 438 round trip, up from $ 378 to $ 418. Fares between <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> will go to $ 258 to $ 298 from $ 248 to $ 288. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, however, emphasized that the airline was matching the MaxSaver hikes only in selected markets. Passenger traffic normally increases this time of year, a peak travel season. The airlines have been under pressure to hike fares because their costs, mainly fuel prices, have increased sharply in recent months. `` I do n't think it was too much of a surprise, given the way costs have been escalating,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Starkman </PERSON>, an airline analyst at <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Two weeks ago, a number of big carriers led by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> said they planned to raise fares on most domestic routes and eliminate discount fares used mainly by business travelers The increases did n't apply to the MaxSavers, however. The airlines said Wednesday they are waiving the usual 14-day advance-purchase requirements for travel between Dec. 20 and Jan. 5 when seats are available. No refunds are allowed, and passengers must buy tickets within 24 hours of making a reservation and must stay over a Saturday night.

<HEAD>Coke Classic Remains Top-Selling Soft Drink, New Coke Off Top 10

 Coca-Cola Classic was tops in 1989, but the drink known as <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> that was introduced to replace it in 1985 fell out of the annual Top 10 soft drink rankings for the first time, an industry newsletter says. The rankings released Wednesday by <ORGANIZATION> Beverage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Digest </ORGANIZATION> indicated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>, which had tied with RC Cola and Caffeine-Free Diet Pepsi for 10th place in 1988, failed to make the 10 top rankings this year. Publisher <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON> said <PERSON> Caffeine-Free </PERSON> <PERSON> Diet </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepsi </PERSON> broke the tie this year, capturing 10th place with a 1.5 percent market share and leaving <ORGANIZATION> RC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cola </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> in a close fight for 11th at 1.4 percent each. The Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> introduced <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> in 1985, saying that it improved on the flavor of it regular cola. But the company said fans of the original <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> taste deluged the company with protests, and the company put the original drink back on the market three months later as Coca-Cola Classic. New <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> was kept alive, but its share of market rapidly fell to the low single digits after capturing an estimated 15 percent of 1985 soft drink sales. In 1989, Coca-Cola Classic retained the top ranking for the fourth consecutive year, although its market share fell to 20.0 percent from 20.1 percent in 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> was second at 18.3 percent, down 0.4 percentage point from 1988. Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> placed third with 8.9 percent share of market, <ORGANIZATION> Diet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> was fourth at 5.7 percent and Dr Pepper was fifth at 4.6 percent, according to <ORGANIZATION> Beverage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Digest </ORGANIZATION>, published from <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>. Filling out the rest of the Top 10 list were Sprite in sixth place at 3.6 percent, followed by <PERSON> Mountain </PERSON> <PERSON> Dew </PERSON> at 3.5 percent, 7Up at 2.9 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Caffeine-Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> at 2.4 percent. The retail value of the soft drink market is $ 43 billion, according to <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON>. That is up 2 percent from 1988, when sales rose 4.5 percent. <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON> said the slower growth was due to cooler weather in many parts of the nation this past summer, a prime sales season for soft drinks. He noted that the four diet soft drinks in the Top 10 this year had combined market share growth of 1.7 percentage points, while the six sugared products saw their combined market share fall 0.3 percent. `` We are watching our calories,'' he said. He said diet soft drinks are gaining ground in part because people like the taste and because the soft drink makers are offering diet drinks in more forms than ever. Counting all soft drinks sold by individual companies, <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> commanded the biggest corporate share of the industry in 1989 with 41.1 percent, up from 40.5 percent a year earlier, the rankings indicated. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION> was second in corporate share of the soft drink business with 31.1 percent, up 0.4 percentage point from 1988. Dr Pepper-Seven Up ranks a distant third with a 10 percent corporate share of the market, according to the Beverage Digest rankings. Cadbury Beverages was fourth at 3.1 percent and Royal Crown was fifth at 2.8 percent.

<HEAD>Sun Needles IBM About Cutbacks, Takes Partial Credit for IBM Woes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> McNealy </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microsystems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, is needling rival <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> over its huge job cuts and said his computer company can take some of the credit for Big Blue's woes. <PERSON> McNealy </PERSON>, who introduced two important additions to Sun's SPARC desktop computer family Wednesday, predicted a bright future for his $ 1.8 billion company in the 1990s despite problems elsewhere in the industry. <PERSON> McNealy </PERSON>'s uncharacteristic jabs at <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> and Wall Street traders came in response to questions about the effect on the computer industry of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement Tuesday that it would cut 10,000 jobs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and set aside $ 2.3 billion from its pretax profit to pay for the cuts. Asked in an interview Wednesday whether Mountain View-based Sun might make any cutbacks, <PERSON> McNealy </PERSON> quipped, `` Maybe we should and make the stock go up.'' <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s stock rose 37 -LCB- cents on Tuesday's announcement, but fell $ 1 Wednesday to $ 98.62 -LCB-. `` Look at what the analysts did,'' <PERSON> McNealy </PERSON> said. `` <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> made a statement yesterday that something is very wrong. They laid off a whole <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microsystems </ORGANIZATION> worth of employees and they wrote off from profits more than we have in annual revenue. And their stock went up. `` That's a fundamental statement that, ` We do n't know what to do with our cash, so we might as well pay it out in dividends.' Which is what they're doing. `` Their stock went up because -LRB- analysts -RRB- said, ` <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> just washed all their dirty socks, they took huge reserves and they padded their balance sheet and income statement massively so that they're probably not going to have a bad quarter the next couple of quarters So I'll get in, ride it up ... then get out before they do the next one.'' <PERSON> McNealy </PERSON> noted that <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s moves were typical of many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies. `` There are lots of -LRB- chief financial officers -RRB- in industry who say when you take a bath, take a big bath because that makes your stock price go up,'' he said. `` But is that any way to run a company? I do n't think so.'' That type of thinking, and the short-term opportunities it provides traders on Wall Street, he said, results from the rules set by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm not blaming the traders. It's the rules,'' he said. The answer, he claims, would be to impose heavy income taxes on profits from stock held less than a year or two. <PERSON> McNealy </PERSON> said he has long predicted that the type of workstation computers Sun sells would cut into the sales of mainframe and minicomputer systems of companies like <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>. Workstations are powerful desktop computers that can be used for various applications, such as spreadsheets, word processing and database programming. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s mainframes and minicomputers are time-shared systems hooked to a large number of terminals, and all the applications are handled by the main processor. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> also makes personal computers. The three fastest-growing computer companies of the 1980s, <PERSON> McNealy </PERSON> said, were <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and Sun, all of which are desktop-oriented. That growth came at the expense of the companies that get most of their profit from the bigger, costlier computers, such as <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Amdahl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Wang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> Many industry analysts agree with <PERSON> McNealy </PERSON>'s views. `` It's fair to say that companies like <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>, Sun, <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> and others can take appropriate credit for <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s decade-long problems,'' said analyst <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> brokerage <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Stephens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` What's basically happened at <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> is their technology is obsolete,'' he said `` The model of computing on which they have built is no longer the preferred model.'' Sun's latest entries into its SPARC line are the powerful SPARCserver 490, which is priced at $ 113,900 with 32 megabytes of main memory, and an entry-level SPARCserver 1, priced at $ 18,900 with 8 megabytes of main memory. Founded in 1982, <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> has had only one quarter when it did n't show a profit Sun lost $ 20.3 million in the fiscal fourth quarter ended last June 30, blaming the slip on product transition and foulups in an internal computer management system. That cut its fiscal 1989 profit to $ 60.8 million on $ 1.8 billion in sales. The company recovered quickly, though, earning $ 5.2 million in the first quarter of its 1990 fiscal year. <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> expects Sun will post $ 93 million in profits in fiscal 1990 on $ 2.5 billion in sales.

 The dollar was little changed in light European trading early today. Gold bullion prices were higher. Dealers said the dollar firmed in late-morning trading amid short-loss buying by investors who had earlier sold borrowed dollars on expectations of further declines. The market also appeared to be squaring positions before Friday's release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment rate figures for November. Analysts predicted the unemployment rate will rise from 5.3 percent to 5.4 percent.

<HEAD>Stocks At Another Record High, Dollar Edges Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s main index closed at a record high for the 11th time in the last 12 trading days today, and the dollar edged up against the Japanese yen for the fifth consecutive day. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 203.82 points, or 0.54 percent, closing at 37,858.11. The index has risen 725.43 points, or 1.95 percent, in the last four days alone, and 1,964.53 points, or 5.47 percent, since Nov. 20. On Wednesday, `` trust fund managers were placing large orders, which contributed to the Nikkei's advance,'' said a dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. Dealers said investors were reassured by an <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> announcement that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s real gross national product grew 2.9 percent in the July-September quarter from the previous quarter. The rise in inflation-adjusted GNP was equivalent to a 12.2 percent annual growth rate, the highest since 1973, the agency said. Large capital shares and blue-chip electricals remained at the center of trading activity, but investors also were turning their interest to sectors that had been lagging in the last few weeks, such as textiles and food issues, dealers said. `` Trading is becoming more active and broader,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> dealer. `` I expect the bullish trend to continue for some time.'' In the currency market, the dollar closed at 144.13 yen, up 0.38 yen from Wednesday's close of 143.75 yen. It opened at 143.95 yen and ranged between 143.94 yen and 144.33 yen. The dollar now has gained 1.23 yen in the last five days. Currency dealers said the dollar opened higher in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> after gains on overseas markets, and continued to rise on buying by insurance and trust banks. Dollar-buying was triggered by warnings by the East German military that it would not tolerate attempts by citizens to seize munitions from security installations, the dealers said. They said fleeting worries that the military might block the country's reform movement led some to sell West German marks. Investors had been buying marks in a belief that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would benefit from economic and other reforms in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. <PERSON> Takashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanagami </PERSON>, manager of foreign exchange dealings at <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said the West German mark would strengthen further if next week's <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> summit decides to help East European countries.

 The former chairman of publishing giant <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and two current executives of the company have settled <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> charges alleging they filed misleading documents. The three _ <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>'s chairman from 1980 to 1988; <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>'s chief operating officer; and <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chell </PERSON>, the publisher's general counsel _ were accused of filing misleading or incomplete documents concerning the purpose for buying 1.2 million <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> shares for a company employee stock option plan in 1987. In a civil complaint filed Wednesday at federal court in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> sought an injunction to prohibit the trio from violating federal securities rules. But simultaneously with the charges, the three _ without admitting or denying wrongdoing _ settled and consented to an injunction barring them from violating securities disclosure rules. A spokesman for <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> did not have an immediate comment on the settlement Wednesday evening. `` We believe it to be the first action the commission has brought in a filing by an <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION>, which are increasingly being used as a takeover defense,'' said <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Janick </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> attorney in the case. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> complaint alleged that beginning in May 1987, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chell </PERSON> began to develop a plan to recapitalize <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> in anticipation of a possible hostile takeover. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> later headed a <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> management group that lost a takeover battle for <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> media lord <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>. In 1988, a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> court blocked a restructuring <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> proposed as a defense against an unwanted $ 1.9 billion bid from the <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. Bass later dropped his bid after competing offers were launched by the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Maxwell </LOCATION>. According to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> complaint, as part of the alleged recapitalization proposal, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chell </PERSON> caused <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION>'s employee stock ownership plan -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to buy 1.2 million <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> shares, which was more than 5 percent of the then-outstanding stock. By law, persons or companies acquiring 5 percent or more of a company must disclose their stake and state their intentions in an <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> document known as a 13-D. But the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> charged that the 13-D filed by the trio did not disclose `` that a purpose of the acquisition was to further the recapitalization.'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>' lawyer, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, issued a written statement concerning the settlement, which said: `` Since the <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION>'s purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> shares was extremely profitable to <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> employees, it satisfied the stated purpose of the transaction to allow ` employees to acquire stock ownership interest in the company.' `` Mr. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> is pleased that the -LRB- SEC -RRB-'s action, alleging that a further statement of purpose was necessary, could be settled without spending the time and resources that would be required to litigate the commission's factual allegations and legal theories,'' the statement said.

<HEAD>SEC Says It's Ready and Waiting to Catch Illegal Short Sellers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said it is ready to prosecute market manipulation by the practice of short selling _ but the evidence is n't always there. `` We're committed to identify short selling abuse wherever it may occur,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sturc </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s Enforcement Division told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel Wednesday. But he and another <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> official also told a subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> `` short selling also provides the market with two vital benefits.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ketchum </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s Division of Market Regulation, told the panel those benefits are market liquidity and price efficiency which help prevent volatility _ the steep price rises and drops that can panic investors and send the market plunging. But <PERSON> Sturc </PERSON>, an associate director of the enforcement division noted that he and <PERSON> Ketchum </PERSON> were `` not here to defend or attack short selling.'' In short-selling, an investor tries to take advantage of an anticipated drop in the price of a company's stock. The investor borrows stock from a broker and sells it, hoping to replace it with stock purchased at a lower price. The investor's profit would come from the difference between the price obtained for the borrowed stock and the lower price paid to replace it. Short selling is not illegal and stockholders are allowed to lend or borrow stock they are holding for customers, if the stock has been purchased on margin _ the buyer did not put up the full purchase price. But in testimony last week before the commerce, consumer and monetary affairs subcommittee, some witnesses complained some professional short-sellers often break the rules to get a stock to drop quickly and spread false rumors about a company, its products or its management. That testimony was about the over-the-counter market, which does not have the same rules governing short sales as do the stock exchanges. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION>, a private, self-regulating group oversees the over-the-counter market. <PERSON> Sturc </PERSON>, however, noted that the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> considers all complaints of short selling abuses, but often investigations `` do not lead to sustainable evidence of violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.'' At the beginning of the hearing the subcommittee chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Ga., said he was not sure `` that the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> is on the same wavelength as the subcommittee. But <PERSON> Sturc </PERSON> explained that often when companies complain they are the victims of short sellers spreading false rumors, there is no proof where the rumors originated or whether it has had an effect of the company's stock. `` We have a strong enforcement interest,'' said <PERSON> Sturc </PERSON>, adding `` I regret to say, Mr. Chairman, we have not received allegations of misconduct to quite the degree of specificity as has been presented to the subcommittee by several of the witnesses. We would be happy to receive them. My job is to try find violators and catch them and that's what I like to do.'' After the session, <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> told reporters that the hearings were `` not a witchhunt as far as the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION> were concerned. I thought there was good explanations.''

<HEAD>West German Mobile Phone License Awarded to International Consortium</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> today awarded a license to build and operate a private mobile telephone system that analysts estimate could be worth more than $ 5 billion to a four-nation consortium. Led by <ORGANIZATION> Mannesmann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>, the group also includes <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telesis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wireless </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lyonnaise </PERSON> <PERSON> des </PERSON> <PERSON> Eaux </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Genossenschaftsbank </ORGANIZATION>, a major West German bank. The Post Ministry chose the consortium from a large field of contending groups, which included several of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s largest companies and international telecommunications concerns. The private network, called D-2, will compete with the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s own D-1 system. It will be the second digital cellular system in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The German government now operates an analog cellular network and plans to build its own digital system. <ORGANIZATION> Mannesmann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kienzle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GmbH </ORGANIZATION>, the electronics subsidiary of the West German engineering concern, will hold a majority stake in the consortium, called <ORGANIZATION> Mannesmann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mobilfunk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GmbH </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts have said that operating a mobile phone network in densely-populated <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will be an extremely profitable business in the 1990s. The value of the license has been estimated at 2 billion to 10 billion marks, or the equivalent of about $ 1.1 billion to $ 5.6 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Mannesmann </ORGANIZATION> has said construction of the network will require initial investments of $ 2.2 billion. Rumors that the consortium won the bidding war spurred a rally in <ORGANIZATION> Mannesmann </ORGANIZATION> stock in recent days. Since last Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Mannesmann </ORGANIZATION> stock has surged some 25 percent to close at 340.00 marks a share, or about $ 192, on Wednesday. The decision by Post Minister <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarz-Schilling </PERSON> was based on a recommendation of a special advisory panel that ranked the <ORGANIZATION> Mannesmann </ORGANIZATION> consortium first among the bidders. <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telesis </LOCATION>, which holds a 26 percent interest in the consortium, has not put a dollar value on its share of the license, but analysts estimate it could increase the per-share value of the company's stock by $ 3 or $ 4 as the financial market reacts to the announcement, company spokeswoman <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Damianakes </PERSON> said. `` We view the cellular business as an ` <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>' opportunity,'' <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginn </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> PacTel </ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive officer, said in a news release today `` This license expands our reach into the international cellular market and provides significant potential for increasing shareowner value during the 1990s,'' <PERSON> Ginn </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pacific </PERSON> <PERSON> Telesis </PERSON>, one of the `` Baby Bells'' created after the breakup of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, has a contract with the consortium to design, engineer and manage the new system's construction <ORGANIZATION> PacTel </ORGANIZATION>'s 26 percent interest covers about 16 million potential cellular subscribers, compared with its nearly 30 million potential subscribers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ginn </PERSON> said. Other partners in the consortium are <ORGANIZATION> Mannesmann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Genossenschaftsbank </ORGANIZATION>, Cable and <ORGANIZATION> Wireless </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lyonnaise </PERSON> <PERSON> des </PERSON> <PERSON> Eaux </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> and Automobile Trades.

 <PERSON> Nadia </PERSON> <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> will need her nimblest footwork since her perfect score on the balance beam to salvage her marketing potential, now that her relationship with a married father of four kids has been made public. `` I think there are some problems. No one is going to touch her right now,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogden </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which handles endorsements for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gymnast <PERSON> Bart </PERSON> <PERSON> Conner </PERSON>. `` She's an intriguing sports figure. But advertisers and companies have to be very careful,'' <PERSON> Ogden </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` There have to be some answers. She's got to avoid the negatives.'' Sports agents believe there may still be marketability for <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON>, the first gymnast to score a perfect 10 in the Olympics. She slogged six hours through mud and ice Nov. 28 to flee her native <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and now has refugee status in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Time will tell. If it's a one-day furor, it wo n't make any difference,'' said <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> agent who represents about 100 athletes, including 13 professional quarterbacks. `` This is entirely an issue of her private life. Prior to that disclosure, she would have been very hot and marketable,'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said. ` If romantic peccadilloes disqualified someone from being perceived as an attractive personality, half the people who do endorsements would not be doing them.'' <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON>'s flight around what's left of the Iron Curtain was arranged by Romanian emigre <PERSON> Constantin </PERSON> <PERSON> Panait </PERSON>, 34, a self-employed south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> roofer who has a wife and four children. The two met at a party in 1987 in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> knew he was married. `` So what? It did n't matter,'' said the 28-year-old <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON>, who left behind her three gold medals from the 1976 Olympics, her family and a life of privilege for a chance to `` settle down together'' with <PERSON> Panait </PERSON>. The relationship may matter to corporations, who routinely insert escape clauses that can void endorsement contracts if athletes engage in compromising behavior. `` If anyone has a bad image with public or does something distasteful, it makes it difficult to endorse a product. The name of the game is selling,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Grey Advertising, whose clients include <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasorda </PERSON>, <PERSON> Orel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hershiser </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Butkus </PERSON>. `` We prefer people to be squeaky clean,'' said <PERSON> Vangie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hay </PERSON>? e, they do it, too.

 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says it wants to return to its roots, and some industry analysts are praising the move. The nation's third-largest automaker announced Wednesday that it has put its <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary on the block, sharply scaling back the company's diversification drive of earlier this decade. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> said it has hired <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to advise it on the sale of the aerospace and military technologies division. It did not disclose what price it might seek. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> is comprised of <ORGANIZATION> Gulfstream </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a corporate jet maker that was acquired for $ 637 million in 1985; <ORGANIZATION> Electrospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a maker of defense and electronics products and systems bought for $ 367 million in 1987; and <ORGANIZATION> Airborne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, formed in January 1989 by combining military aviation-related functions of <LOCATION> Gulfstream </LOCATION> and Electrospace. The vast majority of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION>' 1988 revenue of $ 1.3 billion stems from <LOCATION> Gulfstream </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stellman </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION>. Total <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> revenues in 1988 were $ 35.47 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> also said Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> Gulfstream </ORGANIZATION> founder and Chairman <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Paulson </PERSON> resigned from the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> board of directors and took a leave of absence from <LOCATION> Gulfstream </LOCATION> to pursue a potential purchase of all or some of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Paulson </PERSON>, in a meeting Wednesday with <ORGANIZATION> Gulfstream </ORGANIZATION> employees in <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, said he mainly was interested in acquiring <ORGANIZATION> Gulfstream </ORGANIZATION> but would make a bid for all of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> if necessary. <PERSON> Paulson </PERSON> told the workers that if he made a successful bid for <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION>, he subsequently would attempt to sell <ORGANIZATION> Electrospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> and Airborne Systems. He said he believes he will need about a week to prepare his offer but is working with banks about possible financing. Since Oct. 1, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> has been involved in an aggressive cost-cutting program to slash at least $ 1 billion from its budget by the end of next year, including the elimination of about 2,300, or 8 percent, of its salaried work force. In September, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> sold about half of its stake in the Japanese automaker <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, gaining about $ 310 million after taxes. Sales of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> cars and light trucks for the year through Nov. 30 were 6.4 percent behind last year's pace, reflecting an industrywide slowdown. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> sale had been under consideration for some time. `` We've had some informal inquiries,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. `` But we've never had any firm offers.'' <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said the vehicle market is going to be fiercely competitive in the future. `` We intend to go head-to-head with the Toyotas and Hondas of the world as well as anybody else in the market,'' he said. `` And this is the right time to take this step. `` The only way to succeed in this kind of environment is to concentrate all our energies and resources on the task of satisfying our customers and insuring that our dealers have the best line of cars and trucks we can possibly produce,'' <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> shares rose 12 -LCB- cents to close at $ 19.12 -LCB- a share Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Although <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> accounted for a relatively small chunk of the parent company's overall earnings, analysts said the businesses had been acquired as a way of helping diversify from the cyclical auto industry. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> had about $ 149 million in pre-tax profits last year and the company had projected earnings of about $ 121 million this year. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> had after-tax profits of $ 1.05 billion in 1988. The company said the hoped-for sale was unrelated to cash needs, but analyst <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> questioned that assertion `` I do n't see how they can say this is n't for cash,'' she said. `` It just seems like a big contradiction. They made the acquisitions so they can be less dependent on the auto industry.'' When <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> announced the <LOCATION> Gulfstream </LOCATION> acquisition in 1985, <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> called it `` an important step in our long-range plan to diversify into high-tech industries like aerospace and electronics.'' Analyst <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Sudol </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Fitch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said the decision to sell <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> was a sound one. `` Since they bought it, the world has changed,'' she said. `` In the current thawing in the Cold War and the anticipated cuts in defense budgets, an operation like that, which is small relative to <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s size, makes less and less sense,'' she added. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> has about 8,300 employees, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gulfstream </PERSON> has about 5,000 workers, Electrospace has about 2,000 and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airborne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> has about 1,300.

<HEAD>Phelps Dodge Announces $375 Million in Pre-tax Charges</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says it will take pre-tax charges of about $ 375 million in the fourth quarter to write down the value of certain assets that have been idle for several years. After deferred tax benefits, these charges will reduce net income in the quarter by about $ 250 million, or $ 7 per common share, the copper company said Wednesday, adding it still expected to report a profit for the period. `` The decision to take these charges at this time is unrelated to our outlook for copper and other market factors _ we remain bullish on the future,'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yearly </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement. Yearly noted that the Phoenix-based company `` has achieved record results for each of 1987, 1988 and the first three quarters of 1989, and there is a continuing strong market for copper and most of our other products.'' Included in the charges are about $ 145 million for reserve provisions for the <LOCATION> Morenci </LOCATION> smelter, about $ 50 million for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cornelia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION>, Concentrator and Smelter in <LOCATION> Ajo </LOCATION>, and `` certain other facilities that have been rendered obsolete by environmental requirements or other economic considerations.'' The charges also reflect the reduction of about $ 115 million in assets stemming from the company's decision to indefinately defer any further pre-operating mine development work on the <LOCATION> Dos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pobres </LOCATION> underground copper deposit near <LOCATION> Safford </LOCATION>. `` These assets are assets that have been idle since 1984,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, a company vice president. `` Consequently, this is a non-cash charge to earnings that we feel we are not going to reactivate in the forseeable future.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Moolick </PERSON>, who retired as president of <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> in 1984, questioned the move. `` The Ajo mine, at the prices we've been experiencing, is a viable property,'' <PERSON> Moolick </PERSON> said. He closed the mine in 1984 when faced with plunging copper prices. However, <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> <PERSON> Alton </PERSON>, a managing general partner of the investment banking firm L.H. <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, praised the action. `` You figure they have new people at the helm, earnings are phenomenal ... and you get the opportunity to clean up the balance sheet. Why not do it when you have the chance?'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION>'s net income for the quarter ended Sept. 30 was $ 115.4 million, or $ 3.26 a share, compared with net income of $ 93.3 million, or $ 2.53 a share, for the same quarter last year. In addition to its copper operations, <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> produces carbon black, fabricates steel wheels and rims for trucks and manufactures magnet wire.

<TEXT>
 Grain futures were lower and soybeans were mixed at the opening today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Wheat prices fell as a result of the release yesterday of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s six - to 10-day forecast The outlook calls for increased chances for rain in the winter wheat region. The lack of export business is putting pressure on soybean futures, although strong demand for soybean oil may be a boost to prices. Corn futures drifted lower on follow-through from the weak closing yesterday, with little news to stimulate buying, said analyst <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Kouba </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. At the open, wheat was 1 -RCB- cents lower to \ cent higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.08 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 1 -LCB- cents lower with December at $ 2.35 cents a bushel; oats were 1 cent lower to \ cent higher with December at $ 1.43 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 1 -LCB- cents to 3 cents lower with January at $ 5.78 a bushel. Livestock futures were lower and pork futures mixed in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Pork belly futures drifted lower after opening higher, with profit-taking wiping out the earlier gains. Movement of bellies into storage and falling belly prices also put pressure on futures. Livestock futures were slightly higher due to concerns over cold temperatures in the Plains, which could affect feeding. Live cattle were .17 cent lower to .10 cent higher with December at 75.52 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent lower to .13 cent higher with January at 82.90 cents a pound; hogs were .15 cent lower to .25 cent higher with December at 51.50 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .90 cent lower to .10 cent higher with February at 55.55 cents a pound. Livestock and pork futures settled mixed in Wednesday's trading.

<HEAD>Hooker Seeks Bankruptcy Court Permission to Sell Two Retail Chains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 L.J. <ORGANIZATION> Hooker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which tried unsuccessfully to sell its <ORGANIZATION> B. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Altman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> department store chain, on Thursday said it wants to find buyers for two other retailers, Bonwit Teller and <PERSON> Sakowitz </PERSON>. The proposed sale of Bonwit Teller reverses <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON>'s previous plan to retain the century-old 16-store upscale chain. <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON>, which is operating under bankruptcy law protection from creditors, said it has determined it would be best to seek buyers for New York-based Bonwit Teller and <PERSON> Sakowitz </PERSON>, a specialty retailer based in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigoloff </PERSON>, chief executive of <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON>, said that while the Bonwit Teller and <PERSON> Sakowitz </PERSON> operations have been doing better, <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON> management felt the best way to maximize returns was through a sale. He said Bonwit Teller would be a more attractive property to potential buyers than <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> was. `` <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> required an investment of approximately $ 100 million to bring it to the point where it could compete,'' <PERSON> Sigoloff </PERSON> said in a news release. `` Bonwit Teller and <PERSON> Sakowitz </PERSON> each has markedly better physical facilities, a more focused business and an up-to-date image with its customers.'' The sale of Bonwit Teller, a wholly-owned <ORGANIZATION> Hooker </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, and <PERSON> Sakowitz </PERSON>, in which <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON> bought a controlling interest two years ago, should be completed within `` a relatively short period of time,'' <PERSON> Sigoloff </PERSON> said. The Bonwit chain has its flagship store in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s Trump Plaza and operates 15 branches scattered throughout the East, <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, South and West. <PERSON> Sakowitz </PERSON>'s main store is in the Post Oak Galleria in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and its six other stores are mostly in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The plan to sell Bonwit Teller and <PERSON> Sakowitz </PERSON> must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON> said it is seeking the court's permission to retain <ORGANIZATION> Financo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based investment banking firm that specializes in retail transactions, to handle the sales <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Financo </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, said information about Bonwit and <PERSON> Sakowitz </PERSON> would be available for prospective bidders within two weeks. `` We have received numerous inquiries concerning the possible sale of both <PERSON> Bonwit </PERSON> <PERSON> Teller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sakowitz </PERSON>,'' he said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakowitz </PERSON>, the chain's president, has indicated he would lead a group of investors in making a bid for the company, <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON> said in its news release. A Hooker spokeswoman, <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, said the company has n't disclosed how much it wants for the two chains L.J. <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON> filed for Chapter 11 protection under the federal bankruptcy code in August after its financially distressed Australian parent company <ORGANIZATION> Hooker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was turned over to a provisional liquidator. Last month L.J. Hooker announced it had not received a suitable offer for <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> and would close down six of the chain's seven stores. A going-out-of-business sale started the day after Thanksgiving. The goal is to liquidate all inventory by Jan. 29. The Altman store in the Forest Fair Mall outside <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, which <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON> owns, is staying in operation so as not to impair business at the shopping mall. The Bonwit and <PERSON> Sakowitz </PERSON> chains will lengthen the already long list of retailers on the selling block. Friday is the deadline for initial offers for <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s, the crown jewel of the retail empire owned by highly leveraged <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> is selling its <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> chains. By selling Bonwit Teller and <PERSON> Sakowitz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON> will have virtually withdrawn from retailing in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Since entering the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retail business in 1986, analysts say <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON> spent more than $ 1 billion to build up its presence. Recently, <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON> sold its <ORGANIZATION> Parisian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> department store chain based in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>. Its Merksamer Jewelers was taken over in a leveraged buyout by the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, Calif.-based chain's Assuming <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON> succeeds in selling Bonwit Teller and <PERSON> Sakowitz </PERSON>, the company's remaining <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assets will be three shopping malls, various commercial real estate properties and a commercial real estate brokerage. Hooker spokeswoman Ms. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said a private investment group has made a bid for most of those assets.

 The stock market drifted aimlessly today as traders awaited the latest report on employment. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dipped 4.69 to 2,732.08 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.

<HEAD>Four-Nation Group To Build Mobile Phone Network Worth Billions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A four-nation consortium Thursday won the rights to build and run a private mobile telephone network in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, a license that some analysts say could amount to a $ 6 billion gold mine in the 1990s. The group led by <ORGANIZATION> Mannesmann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> also includes <PERSON> Pacific </PERSON> <PERSON> Telesis </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wireless </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lyonnaise </PERSON> <PERSON> des </PERSON> <PERSON> Eaux </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Genossenschaftsbank </ORGANIZATION>, a major West German bank. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s current mobile phone network, operated by the government, is suffering from severe capacity restraints. A new network in the densely populated, economically strong country is considered certain to be a highly profitable enterprise in the next decade. But many analysts warn that implementation could face unforeseen delays or obstacles dueto changing regulation and increasing competition. `` We view the cellular business as an ` <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>' opportunity,'' <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginn </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telesis </ORGANIZATION>, said in a news release issued from the company's <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> `` This license expands our reach into the international cellular market and provides significant potential for increasing shareholder value in the 1990s,'' <PERSON> Ginn </PERSON> said. The Post Ministry chose the consortium from a large field of contenders that included several of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s largest companies and international telecommunications concerns. The private network, called D-2, will compete with the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s own D-1 system. Plans call for <ORGANIZATION> Mannesmann </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to start building separate networks in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1991 and complete them by 1994, Post Minister <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarz-Schilling </PERSON> told reporters. The two systems will be integrated into a larger European network so the same cellular mobile phones can be used all over <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. That consideration is significant because of plans by the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, known as the Common Market, to drop internal trade barriers by 1992 and create a unified market. Schwarz-Schilling said the new project will require investments of $ 1.1 billion to $ 2.3 billion. The private network should break even by 1995, he said. Analysts say D-2 could have 500,000 or more users by that time. <ORGANIZATION> Mannesmann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kienzle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GmbH </ORGANIZATION>, the electronics subsidiary of the West German engineering concern, will hold a 51 percent stake in the consortium, called <ORGANIZATION> Mannesmann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mobilfunk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GmbH </ORGANIZATION> and based in <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The final license agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Mannesmann </ORGANIZATION> will be signed in January, Schwarz-Schilling said. <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telesis </ORGANIZATION> will hold 26 percent of the consortium, DG-Bank 10 percent, Cable and Wireless 5 percent, and <PERSON> Lyonnaise </PERSON> <PERSON> des </PERSON> <PERSON> Eaux </PERSON> 2.5 percent. The remaining 5.5 percent will be held by various smaller shareholders. Other bidders for the license included German heavyweights like <ORGANIZATION> Bayerische </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motoren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Werke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>, the maker of <ORGANIZATION> BMW </ORGANIZATION> cars; <ORGANIZATION> Axel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Springer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Verlag </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>, a major West German publisher; and several big industrial firms. Under a formula used by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> analysts to value mobile phone licenses, the order could be worth $ 6 billion. But others said that amount is too high because it does not consider necessary outlays and risks. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Verghese </PERSON>, electronics analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, cautioned that a Europe-wide network could be delayed by disagreements within the European Community. He also said growing competition in coming years is likely to put pressure on profit margins. `` On paper it all looks wonderful, but the implementation could be delayed,'' <PERSON> Verghese </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telesis </LOCATION> shares were up by 75 cents at $ 48.50 a share in late <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. But <ORGANIZATION> Mannesmann </ORGANIZATION> shares dropped by nearly 2.8 percent in domestic trading after the announcement, on what traders called profit-taking following a recent runup in the stock due to speculation about the phone license. `` Everybody got carried away by the idea that <ORGANIZATION> Mannesmann </ORGANIZATION> got a license for printing money, but for the next three years we will see only costs,'' said <PERSON> Beate </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Seipen </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stock analyst.

 <ORGANIZATION> Pinnacle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> agreed to inject $ 450 million into its troubled thrift subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION>, just hours before tough, new federal capital standards for thrifts took affect Thursday. The agreement, announced late Wednesday, settled months of negotiations between <ORGANIZATION> Pinnacle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thrift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION> over the federal agency's demand that Pinnacle West inject $ 510 million into <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION>. Pinnacle West has received a $ 1.87 billion takeover offer from <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION>., the utility company based in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION> executives were upbeat that the settlement would clear the way for a `` This agreement ... should free Pinnacle West to devote full attention to addressing the offer from <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION>. We are eager to move ahead,'' <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION> Executive Vice President <PERSON> Verl </PERSON> <PERSON> Topham </PERSON> said in a statement. Under terms of its agreement with regulators, Pinnacle West will give <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION> $ 300 million by March 31, 1990 and a $ 150 million unsecured note. The <ORGANIZATION> OTS </ORGANIZATION> said the `` fair and reasonable'' settlement would avoid costly litigation. Pinnacle West had threated to seek bankruptcy protection if it could not reach an agreement with bank regulators. Pinnacle West said its board will consider the <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION> offer on an unspecified date. The bid, which is conditioned upon Pinnacle West disposing of <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION>, is an expansion of an earlier <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION> offer to buy <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pinnacle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary and <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION>'s largest utility. Pinnacle West Chairman <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Turley </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION> settlement would not affect the <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION> offer even though <ORGANIZATION> APS </ORGANIZATION> common stock would be used as collateral to secure financing for the cash infusion into <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Renz </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, chairman of the three-member <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates utilities, voiced concern over the link with <ORGANIZATION> APS </ORGANIZATION>. He said the commission `` is deeply concerned about the possibility that <LOCATION> Pinnacle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> creditors will look to -LRB- APS -RRB- for repayment.'' But <PERSON> Turley </PERSON> countered that `` it's illogical for anybody to think that <ORGANIZATION> APS </ORGANIZATION> would assume the debt obligations of Pinnacle West. It's impossible and illegal for <ORGANIZATION> APS </ORGANIZATION> to raise its rates to pay our interest on debt. <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> called the infusion `` an important beginning of the recapitalization of <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION>'' and said the thrift, which has been hard hit by <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s real estate slump, would be able to get back on its feet eventually. But he cautioned that the market `` is going down, and we will continue to have losses in the short term.'' <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 209 million in 1988 and $ 105 million in the first six months of this year, with a projected loss of about the same amount in the last six months. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> criticized the settlement for saddling Pinnacle West `` with additional debt at a time when the company can ill afford it, and leaves ownership of <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION> in the hands of Pinnacle West with no assurance that losses will not continue to mount.'' In addition to <ORGANIZATION> APS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION>, Pinnacle West also owns three small subsidiaries involved in mining, real estate development and investments.

 One of the customers on <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> <PERSON> Grinwald </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> charter boat this summer put the hard times facing the lake's sport fishing businesses into painfully clear perspective. `` He said, ` Captain, I understand there's bad news and good news on the lake. ... The bad news is I ca n't eat the fish I catch. The good news is I'm not going to be able to catch one.''' <PERSON> Grinwald </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, is n't laughing. What was, by <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> estimates, the cornerstone of a $ 1.6 billion Great Lakes fishery for <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> in 1985 has weakened dramatically. A bacterial disease seems to be decimating the lake's bread-and-butter sport fish, chinook salmon And this summer, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> issued a controversial warning that chemical contamination was making the fish a risky meal. Low catches and fish consumption warnings drove 140 <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> charter boats off the lake this year, leaving 876 operators where two years ago there were more than 1,000, <PERSON> Grinwald </PERSON> said Wednesday. More are expected to leave by spring. `` I know at least six boats from <PERSON> Ludington </PERSON> that will go to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> next year,'' <PERSON> Ludington </PERSON> charter captain <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacko </PERSON> said. `` That's bad. When you lose charter boats, you start losing motel rooms.'' <PERSON> Lacko </PERSON> estimates he lost half of his business in the past two years. `` The fishing is just not there,'' he said. <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s creel surveys show a 50 percent drop in the number of chinook salmon caught, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> fish specialist in Madison. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> surveys map a drop in the amount of time sport fishermen spent on the lake _ down from 3.5 million hours spent at nine ports in the mid-1980s to an estimated 1.8 million hours this year, said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakoczy </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> biologist in <LOCATION> Charlevoix </LOCATION>. The chinook catch alone in the region from <LOCATION> Ludington </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Frankfort </LOCATION> _ along the middle western coast of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> along <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Lower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> _ dropped from 242,000 fish in May and August of 1986 to 34,000 chinook the same period this year, <PERSON> Grinwald </PERSON> said. Chinook salmon, introduced into <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> more than 25 years ago to control an alien alewife population, are the dominant sport fish in the lake and make up more than half the catch, according to <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> record keepers. The salmon sport fishing industry supports not only charter operations but has helped revitalize many coastal towns. `` I've always felt the economic clout of the Great Lakes sport fishery is greatly undervalued,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kitchell </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin-Madison </ORGANIZATION> researcher. `` You see potted geraniums on the pilings in <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION> -RRB- where before that was nothing; you get boatels in marinas. It is the single most remarkable thing that's happened in fishery management.'' Dramatic declines in the salmon population can only be bad for the coastal economy, <PERSON> Kitchell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he is unsure the lake again will host the fishery _ created by overstocking of chinook salmon and an abundance of alewife _ that kept charter boat operators booked solid in the early 1980s. `` Some of the marginal operations obviously are going to drop out,'' he said. `` The hard core _ 270 to 400 charter operations _ are still going to be there. They'll fish for what is available.'' <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> is still a good place to fish, <PERSON> Grinwald </PERSON> said. `` It's just not the fantastic, incredible fishery it was.''

 Grain and soybean futures prices closed lower in sluggish trading Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Grand Met's Profit Up 23 Percent in Fiscal Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that its net profit jumped 23 percent during its fiscal year, boosted by higher revenue from its food, beverage and retailing operations. The British conglomerate said its profit for the year ended Sept. 30 rose to 508 million pounds, or around $ 823 million, from 412 million pounds, or $ 667 million, the year before. Per-share earnings increased 18.6 percent to 55.6 pence, or 87 cents, from 46.9 pence, or 74 cents. Grand Met bought <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for $ 5.75 billion earlier this year. Revenue for the year soared 54.2 percent to 9.3 billion pounds, or $ 14.6 billion, from 6.03 billion pounds, or $ 9.5 billion. The gains included proceeds from the sale of the company's <ORGANIZATION> Intercontinental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clubs </ORGANIZATION> in December 1988 for more than 500 million pounds, or $ 810 million The greatest impact on the company's results came from <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>, which contributed 2.5 billion pounds, or $ 3.9 billion, to total revenue. Grand Met said intense activity to integrate <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> has included the sale of non-strategic businesses, such as its Bumble Bee and <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> foods operations. `` All parts of the business are performing strongly and management morale is high,'' the company said. Burger King, the fast-food chain which was owned by <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>, contributed 76 million pounds, or $ 119 million, to Grand Met's operating profit The parent company said it will take time for the benefits of a recent restructuring and quality improvement program to bear fruit, but `` the fundamentals of this business are very sound.'' Grand Met said sales from its food businesses, including those that were part of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>, were strong in all divisions and are expected to climb 5 percent in the current quarter. But the slowdown in the British economy has been especially evident in the company's liquor sales over the last 12 to 15 months, said Grand Met Chairman <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON>. The company likely will make further acquisitions and sales in the coming year but it is now prepared to consolidate its current businesses in food, beverages and retailing, <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> said. Grand Met did n't report quarterly or half-year results. It is not required to do so under British law.

<HEAD>Truck Maker Takes Fourth-Quarter Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday reported a $ 13 million fourth-quarter loss and said reduced industrywide demand for trucks and higher costs for purchased components contributed to the decline. The truck and diesel engine maker said it lost 8 cents a share on sales of $ 1 billion compared with a profit for the year-earlier period of $ 82 million or 29 cents a share on sales of $ 1.2 billion. For fiscal 1989, which ended Oct. 31, <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 87 million or 23 cents a share on sales of $ 4.2 billion, down from 1988 annual profits of $ 244 million or 84 cents a share on sales of $ 4.3 billion, the company said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotting </PERSON> blamed the fourth-quarter performance on reduced demand for medium and heavy trucks, higher costs for components and lower sales of service parts and diesel engines to other vehicle makers. Annual earnings were lowered by the `` excess costs'' of adding 27 new truck models and of phasing in a new paint system at <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, plant, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenhouse </PERSON> said the company underestimated the cost of introducing the new models. The company also said it expects to post a 1990 first-quarter loss, because of `` lower truck and engine sales, increased material and component costs, and continued intense price discounting by truck manufacturers.''

<TEXT>
 Diet <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>'s new `` The Right One'' advertising jingle has become a battle hymn for the cola wars, with the ad agency for rival Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> disputing who owns the idea for the tune. The song was picked up for Diet <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> after a similar version apparently was offered to rival Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> as well as Budweiser beer. <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>'s ad agency, <PERSON> Lintas </PERSON>: <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, complains that it should have been given the chance to buy the song before it was offered to anyone else, while <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> is calling the protest a simple publicity stunt by its rival cola maker. <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, executive vice president of Lintas: <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the song used in the Diet <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> television spot was written last year for <ORGANIZATION> Diet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>, although it never was used publicly. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said he fired off a complaint letter to Sunday Productions, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> music house that developed the song, after hearing the similar song in a Diet Pepsi ad during the Thanksgiving weekend. `` I'd like to believe they -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- did n't know it was ours and did n't buy it in a direct attempt to copy the industry leader,'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said Thursday. But <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipsitz </PERSON>, president of Sunday Productions, said it was ludicrous for <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> or its ad agency to say they own the song. <PERSON> Lipsitz </PERSON> said he offered the song to other companies, including Budweiser brewer <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, after <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> rejected it for a possible ad campaign dubbed `` The Real One.'' `` There was no interest from <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>. It was our song,'' <PERSON> Lipsitz </PERSON> said Thursday. `` It's pretty much as if they came to <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and said, ` Write me a song' and did n't use it. Whose song would it be?'' <PERSON> Lipsitz </PERSON> said the tune was among several he presented to <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> wanted a song as a back-up to its current ad campaign `` if and when the day came where we needed a substitute.'' `` Sunday Productions brought back some pieces of music developed from our concept,'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said, adding that Sunday was paid a $ 10,000 `` demo fee.'' A commercial was prepared and then `` put on the shelf'' for possible use later, he said. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lintas </PERSON> should have been given the opportunity to buy the song outright before it was offered to anyone else. The agency is considering legal action, he said. Officials at the ad agency <ORGANIZATION> BBDO </ORGANIZATION> Worldwide who work on the Diet <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> account, did not immediately return telephone calls Thursday. <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> <PERSON> Madeira </PERSON>, a spokeswoman at <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cola </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Purchase </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, headquarters called the complaints a publicity stunt by Atlanta-based rival <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's hard to find any other reason for all of this,'' she said. `` I understand the press had copies of the letters of complaint before the principals.'' Ms. <PERSON> Madeira </PERSON> said <PERSON> Diet </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepsi </PERSON> has been using the `` Right One'' slogan since August but had n't heard any complaints until the television commercial appeared last month. She also said <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>'s application for a trademark for `` The Right One'' was made in July and drew no objection from <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> She said it is not unusual for companies to choose from several songs when considering an ad campaign. Ms. <PERSON> Madeira </PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> looks for music that reflects the character of its products, so it would be pointless to seek a song belonging to a competitor. `` It's hard to imagine that would make sense for either company,'' she said. `` Why would you advertise the personality of a competitor's product?''

<HEAD>Dollar Closes Higher In Dull Dealings</HEAD>
<HEAD>Precede: LONDON</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar closed marginally higher against most foreign currencies Thursday, but trading was light and uneventful. Gold prices scored large gains in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dealings after finishing somewhat higher in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Technical factors were cited for driving prices higher. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold for current delivery ended at $ 410 a troy ounce, up $ 5.10 an ounce from late Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a troy ounce of gold bullion at $ 409.60 as of 4 p.m. EST, $ 5 higher than Wednesday's late bid Traders said the dollar traded within a very narrow range throughout the session, closing near the highs of the day partly on technical factors. Most dealers were awaiting the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s release on Friday of unemployment data for November. The consensus is that the report will show an increase of roughly 150,000 jobs, lower than the 233,000 jobs added during the previous month, and an unemployment rate of 5.4 percent. Unfavorable employment data indicate the economy is slowing and could help encourage the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to lower interest rates. Lower interest rates are bearish for the dollar because they decrease the value of dollar-denominated securities. `` Everybody is convinced that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -LRB- interest -RRB- rates will go down,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Separately, the West German mark continued to flex its muscle. Traders noted the mark remained extremely strong, particularly against the Japanese yen. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar edged up 0.38 Japanese yen to a closing 144.13 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 144.33 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 144.31 yen, up from 144.03 yen on Wednesday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound fell to $ 1.5750, from $ 1.5765 late Wednesday. But in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> it cost $ 1.5780 to buy one pound, more expensive than Wednesday's $ 1.5765. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday included: 1.7725 West German marks, up from 1.7660; 1.5900 Swiss francs, up from 1.5895; 6.0515 French francs, up from 6.0335; 1.1618 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1612, and 1,307.25 Italian lire, up from 1.303.25. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday, included: 1.7720 West German marks, up from 1.7648; 1.5920 Swiss francs, up from 1.5875; 6.0560 French francs, up from 6.0315; 1.9935 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0010; 1,308.00 Italian lire, up from 1,301.15, and 1.1625 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1602. Gold rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 404.25 a troy ounce from $ 402.25 bid late Wednesday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the metal rose to a closing bid of $ 404.00, from $ 403.75 bid late Wednesday. Earlier in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose $ 4.30 to close at a bid $ 405.01. Silver bullion rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 5.60 a troy ounce from $ 5.56 bid late Wednesday.

<HEAD>Soviet Deputies Talk With Boeing About Buying Long-Range Jets</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto SE1</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The inability of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s national airline to provide the service and comfort its citizens want has created the market for a new carrier _ one that might fly American-made jets, according to two members of the Soviet parliament. <PERSON> Valeri </PERSON> <PERSON> Voskoboinikov </PERSON>, vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, and commission member <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Yerohin </PERSON> were part of a delegation representing Aviakompania Sverkhdalnikh Avialiniy, or <ORGANIZATION> ASDA </ORGANIZATION>. The new company was formed last summer to explore creation of a new, long-range Soviet airline to be run independent of the government and compete with government-owned <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION>. The delegation has been gathering information about possible acquisitions of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> jetliners. The idea for <ORGANIZATION> ASDA </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Voskoboinikov </PERSON>, came from <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> pilots and aircraft engineers tired of the carrier's bureaucracy. `` In this situation, <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> is the only airline in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` It can not provide good service for the Soviet citizens and can not provide satisfactory management.'' This year alone there were 20 million potential passengers who could n't be served by <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Yerohin </PERSON> said, noting that was the official figure and `` the real number is probably higher.'' In addition to being the non-communist world's largest maker of jetliners, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> in the past 40 years has produced some of this country's deadliest weapons for use against the Soviets, including the B-52 bomber and Minuteman and air-launched cruise missiles. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> already sells jets to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and other communist nations. <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest airline, already has ordered <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION> A-310 jets and has talked with <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> about possible commercial jet purchases. <PERSON> Voskoboinikov </PERSON>, 34, from <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, is a helicopter pilot and aeronautical engineer. <PERSON> Yerohin </PERSON>, also 34 and an aircraft engineer, is from <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON>. Neither is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Neither they nor <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> would say much about their talks, including how many planes <ORGANIZATION> ASDA </ORGANIZATION> might want or what type. Nor would they say much about the airline's financial arrangements. Much of that has n't been decided, <PERSON> Voskoboinikov </PERSON> said, including whether the new carrier might have some Western investment or be a joint venture with a foreign airline. The goal is to have an airline `` totally independent financially'' of the Soviet government. He and <PERSON> Yerohin </PERSON> stressed the delegation came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> only to gather information to study later. They said it was invited by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and did not plan to visit <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> on this trip. <ORGANIZATION> ASDA </ORGANIZATION> officials previously have said they were interested in 25 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747-400s, but neither of the two <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> deputies would say how many of those long-range jumbo jets or other planes <ORGANIZATION> ASDA </ORGANIZATION> might want to buy or lease. A 747-400 costs $ 125 million or more and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is booked solid with orders through the mid-1990s. <ORGANIZATION> ASDA </ORGANIZATION> hopes to start up by late 1991. `` Right now, negotiations are in process and we can not really tell you what the plans and operations are,'' he said. `` But I can tell you the atmosphere of the negotiations is good.'' The Soviet aerospace industry produces a wide variety of passenger and cargo jets and both <PERSON> Voskoboinikov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yerohin </PERSON> said they are about the same as <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> planes in reliability. But they ca n't match the levels of comfort in Western aircraft, and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> planes are far more economical to run, <PERSON> Vokoboinikov </PERSON> said. He also says Soviet planebuilders wo n't like the competition. `` They will not be happy about it. But at the same time, they will realize they should improve their service,'' <PERSON> Vokoboinikov </PERSON> said. `` Ultimately, the usage of new foreign airplanes will cause improvement of the domestic industry, which will be good for it.'' Routes and destinations have n't been decided, but <PERSON> Voskobionikov </PERSON> said they want to fly `` to practically all parts of the world'' with both passenger and cargo service. <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> flies an estimated 8,100 aircraft to more than 3,700 destinations. <ORGANIZATION> ASDA </ORGANIZATION> wo n't be able to replace that, <PERSON> Voskobionikov </PERSON> said, but there is a market. `` There probably will be clientele for both airlines. ... And our passengers are not used to good service, like they are here,'' he said.

<HEAD>Oil Futures Finish Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Energy futures prices ended mixed Thursday as heating oil staged another weather-related advance. The No. 2 heating oil contract for January delivery shot up 1.01 cents to 65.47 cents a gallon on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The contract traded as high as 65.80 cents during the session after closing up 0.41 cent on Wednesday. Contracts for February through April delivery also gained while longer-term contracts declined. Among other refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale unleaded gasoline for January delivery, which gained 0.33 cent on Wednesday, fell 0.36 cent to finish at 52.81 cents a gallon. Most other contracts also declined. The January contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the main grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, edged up 4 cents to $ 20.51 per 42-gallon barrel. The contract traded as high at $ 20.65 during the session after Wednesday's gain of 13 cents. Other contracts closed mixed. Energy analysts said cold weather as well as strength in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s gasoil market continued to make <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> heating oil attractive to buyers. Heating oil's strength gave the overall market a lift, they said. Low water levels in the <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> have created problems for barges transporting gasoil, the European version of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> home heating oil. Bullishness in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s gasoil market has trickled into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market. `` Today saw continued strength in heating oil due to cold weather here and in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the low <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, assistant director of the energy group at <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Redoglio </PERSON>, energy analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION>, said profit-taking helped depress prices in the gasoline pits `` People were selling gas against heating oil,'' <PERSON> Redoglio </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Westinghouse Broadcasting Buys Eight Radio Stations for $360 Million</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it had completed its previously-disclosed plans to buy eight <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan-Legacy </ORGANIZATION> radio stations in a $ 360 million deal that it called the biggest ever in radio. The purchase gives <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> 21 radio stations with an average cumulative audience of 14.1 million people a week, second only to the 15 million-plus commanded by the 21 stations owned by <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities-ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>, also known as Group W, is buying the stations from <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Legacy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>, which are controlled by broadcaster and financier <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F.X </PERSON> <PERSON> Sillerman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sillerman </PERSON> and his partners will retain a minority interest in <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> W </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, which a source familiar with the deal said was less than 10 percent. Group W, which is an operating unit of <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, announced in April it had agreed to buy 10 <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan-Legacy </ORGANIZATION> stations in a deal reportedly valued at about $ 385 million. But in the meantime, Metropolitan found a local buyer for its two radio stations in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and they were dropped from the deal with Group W. The newly-acquired stations are WNEW-FM in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; WMMR-FM in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>; WCRX-FM and WCPT-AM in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>; WLLZ-FM in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>; KILT-AM and KILT-FM in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and KTWV-FM in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` Our acquisition of these extremely successful stations allows us to compete for radio advertising revenue in nine of the top 10 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets,'' said <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Staniar </PERSON>, chairman of Group W. He said the addition of the youth-oriented FM radio stations in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> to the company's AM news-format stations in those cities will enable <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> to offer appealing package deals to advertisers in those markets. <PERSON> Staniar </PERSON> said the deal also gives Group W programming diversity and size `` that makes our entry into the radio network and program syndication businesses more financially attractive.'' As it completed its purchase of the eight stations, <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> relinquished control of <LOCATION> KODA-FM </LOCATION>, its FM radio station in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Federal regulations prohibit companies from owning two FM radio stations in the same market. The station was placed in a trust and is being sold in a separate transaction to New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> for $ 22 million. Group W Radio's other stations are: <ORGANIZATION> WBZ </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>; WINS, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> KYW </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> KDKA </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> WMAQ </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; KQZY, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>; KQXT, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>; KMEO-AM and <ORGANIZATION> KMEO-FM </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> KFWB </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>; KFBK-AM and KAER, <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>; and KJQY, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>'s other units are <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> W </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, which owns five network-affiliated television stations; <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> W </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION>, a programming and synidication company, and <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> W </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Satellite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, a cable programming, marketing and distribution business based in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Stock Market Plunge Send Precious Metals Higher</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Precious metals futures prices rose sharply Thursday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to a decline in prices on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. In other markets, grains and soybeans were lower; cotton plunged; livestock and pork futures were mixed, and energy prices were mostly lower. Gold settled $ 4.10 to $ 5.10 higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 410.00 a troy ounce; silver was 6.5 cents to 7.2 cents higher with December at $ 5.623 a troy ounce. `` The sharp fall in the stock market caused a flight to quality buying ... in the precious metals market,'' said analyst <ORGANIZATION> Jim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Steel noted that many things have caused movement in precious metals prices, including dollar strength or weakness, interest rates and inflation. `` But what has given gold its bold moves -LRB- upward -RRB- have been the declines in the stock market,'' he said Silver prices followed gold in Thursday's upward surge, helped along by the perception that the metal has been sharply oversold in recent sessions, <PERSON> Steel </PERSON> said. Cotton futures were sharply lower on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as traders had difficulty unloading offerings because of a lack of buyers. At one time, the March contract was down the limit before recovering some losses, said analyst <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON> noted that commission houses were active sellers as prices moved below several support levels. Cotton was .23 cent to 1.55 cents lower with December at 63.97 cents a pound. Grain and soybean futures prices closed lower in sluggish trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. The slide in wheat prices was due to the release Wednesday of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s six - to 10-day forecast, which calls for precipitation in the winter wheat crop areas, said analyst <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Leighty </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Wheat futures received little support from news the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> has approved an offer by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for 410,000 metric tons of wheat under the department's Export Enhancement Program. Under the program, private exporters can sell <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in some markets and collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies. Corn futures traded in a narrow range, finishing lower as professionals and commission houses liquidated their long positions. Soybean prices continue to be weighed down by a lack of export business and continuing good planting conditions in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Wheat was -LCB- cent to 2 -RCB- cents lower with December at $ 4.08 a bushel; corn was 2 -LCB- cents lower to a \ cent higher with December at $ 2.36 \ a bushel; oats were a \ cent lower to a -LCB- cent higher with December at $ 1.44 a bushel; soybeans were 3 -LCB- cents to 7 \ cents lower with January at $ 5.75 -LCB- a Energy futures were mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as prices fluctuated widely during moderate trading. Heating oil continued to provide strength to the market, as another blast of cold weather is expected in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> in coming days, analsyts say. West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 3 cents lower to 4 cents higher with January at $ 20.51 a barrel; heating oil was .30 cent lower to 1.01 cents higher with January at 65.47 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .36 cent lower to .07 cent higher with January at 52.81 cent a gallon. Livestock futures were mostly lower and pork futures down sharply on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Pork belly futures were down the limit in a wave of commission house selling. The selling was prompted by continued concern over the large amount of bellies going into storage and accelerated by the activation of sell-stops. Live cattle were .30 cent lower to .20 cent higher with December at 75.62 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .03 cent higher with January at 82.95 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent lower to .72 cent higher with December at 51.22 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 2 cents lower with February at 54.45 cents a pound.

 <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has announced that it has suspended talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Injury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Settlement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> and will not pursue the company's announced offer to repurchase $ 500 million of <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> preferred stock from the trust. <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> said talks will continue with the trust on ways to improve the trust's financial flexibility and increase value for all shareholders. <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, a spokesman for the trust in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said the trust was trying to raise cash to pay claims. She said <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> has stipulations on how stock can be sold to raise money, and <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> wanted to buy some of its stock back. However, the two sides disagreed over how much that stock was worth. She said the fund is scheduled to receive profit-sharing funds in 1991 based on 1990 profits, but in the meantime, the fund is running short on cash. `` We're exploring our options,'' she said. <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> wanted to help, `` But we're dealing with reality. We want to do what's right for the trust fund,'' she said. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Samson </PERSON>, spokesman for the company, said the two sides disagreed on some of the restrictive covenants but declined to be specific. The trust was created as part of <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy reorganization to compensate victims of asbestos, who had filed suit against the company. The trust was created Nov. 28, 1988, when <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> emerged from its Chapter 11 reorganization proceedings. So far, the trust has paid more than 15,000 personal injury claims totaling more than $ 600 million. The trust has assets including 50 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION>'s new common stock, convertible preferred stock, a $ 1.8 billion bond, and 20 percent of net profits, beginning in 1992.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply rose in the week ended Nov. 27, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,207.9 billion from $ 3,200.7 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 4,052.3 billion from $ 4,049.7 billion. The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 792.9 billion from $ 790.8 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In judging its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures. The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 4.8 percent, which is within the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s target range of 3 percent to 7 percent. The annual growth rate in M3 is 3.8 percent, which is within the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has not set a target for M1 growth since early 1987. For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $ 3,175.2 billion, a 8.0 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13 weeks. M3 averaged $ 4,027.5 billion, up 3.3 percent, while M1 rose 5.5 percent to an average of $ 785.7 billion. In other reports: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> reported commercial and industrial loans at major <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> banks rose $ 3.188 billion _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said bank borrowings from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> at the discount window, excluding extended credit, averaged $ 150 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from $ 656 million the previous week _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said net free reserves averaged $ 569 million in the two weeks ended Nov. 29, down from $ 618 million in the previous two-week period _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> reported that the monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation, was $ 294.5 billion in the two-week period ended Nov. 29, up from $ 292.4 billion two weeks earlier

 <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> stock fell sharply Thursday amid reports of a huge recapitalization plan that would inject up to $ 1 billion into the ailing brokerage. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> has been under increasing pressure in recent weeks to take steps to improve its profitability and avoid a credit downgrading that would tarnish the firm's reputation and increase its borrowing costs. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns 61 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>, reportedly is planning a public sale of 10 million to 22 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> stock and a direct investment of about $ 300 million to raise new capital. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON> reportedly is holding talks about buying a 9.9 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> for about $ 250 million <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Armour </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> senior vice president, confirmed his company is `` reviewing a number of options'' in regard to <LOCATION> Shearson </LOCATION>. But he said it would be `` inappropriate to discuss any details.'' <PERSON> Armour </PERSON> said the review process has been under way for several weeks. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> declined comment on the recapitalization reports. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> closed down $ 1.75, or about 10.6 percent, at $ 14.75 a share in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. The stock rose $ 1.37 -LCB- Wednesday on reports that <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON> might buy up to a 20 percent interest in the company. Analysts pegged Thursday's drop to the lower stake <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON> would have in the latest purported proposal _ reducing the possibility of a takeover _ and to the potential dilution of shares under any new stock issue. ` There's no way the common shareholder comes out well in this,'' said analyst <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckenfelder </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> stock has slumped for several months because of poor earnings reports. The company began searching for new capital after <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in October said it was considering downgrading its credit on $ 4.8 billion in long-term <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> debt. Shearson recently began laying off 800 workers, reducing the size of the nation's second-largest brokerage to 35,700, reshuffled its senior management and slashed stockbroker commissions for the first time in 15 years. A downgrading by <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s would increase <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s cost of borrowing by about $ 10 million to $ 15 million a year, <PERSON> Eckenfelder </PERSON> said. Securities firms borrow heavily to finance finance trading and other activities. More important, analysts said, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> wants to avoid any loss of reputation. `` There's a sense that it's important for the owners to maintain <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> as a top credit,'' <PERSON> Eckenfelder </PERSON> said. Under the reported recapitalization proposal, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> would reduce its <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> holding to under 50 percent through the new offering and the <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON> deal. That would allow the credit card, travel and financial service company to remove <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> from its financial statements. <PERSON> Eckenfelder </PERSON> said selling securities in a brokerage might prove difficult because of slumping conditions throughout the industry. The proposed recapitalization would dilute the holdings of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s second-largest stockholder, <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>, to about 10 percent from 13 percent. The proposal was reported in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and The <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, which cited unidentified sources. Earlier reports said <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON> would have been able to obtain about 20 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s stock if he exercised all of his stock options under the deal as originally proposed. But the Times said the proposed transaction was altered to make it less complex. While any such deal would provide needed capital for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>, some analysts have cautioned that further dividing the ownership of Shearson among three or more large outsiders could prove to be a headache for executives under pressure to turn around the firm's slumping profits <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s said it was mulling a possible credit rating downgrade for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s bonds and commercial paper due to the firm's low level of capital, low profits and exposure in commercial real estate loans and investments, as well as the general slump in brokerage activity.

 <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, using cash won in a lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, revealed Thursday it had purchased $ 2.1 billion worth of stock in <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's fourth largest oil company. <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>'s purchase amounts to about 8.8 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> said it was considering spending another $ 500 million to buy more <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> stock. That would boost its stake to more than 10 percent and use up all the net proceeds of its payment from <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>. The disclosure came in a letter to shareholders and filings with the federal <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` This position has been acquired as a long-term investment,'' Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> told shareholders. `` <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> has no interest in attempting to take over <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>.'' The company said it analyzed the possibility of buying up to 18 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>'s stock but `` has no current plans or proposals'' to do so. The announcement helped deflate takeover speculation that had surrounded <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> stock dropped $ 5.25 to close at $ 66.75 in composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> rose 62 -LCB- cents to close at $ 83.25 as some investors speculated that <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> might try to turn the tables and buy <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>'s stake or even buy all of <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>. `` The perception by some investors is that <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>'s response will be to turn around and buy <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> to make the problem go away. No one believes for a minute that <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> intends to buy <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>,'' said analyst <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Escott </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Rauscher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pierce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refsnes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> investment firm. `` There is n't any way <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>'s going to come in and take <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> over,'' agreed another analyst, <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gaspar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> W. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baird </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>. However, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Londe </PERSON> with <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Sons in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> said the purchase nevertheless could be a good move. `` <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>'s notorious for being a very astute investor. San Francisco-based <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> declined to comment on the announcement. Only Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> announced a $ 1 billion sale of 14.1 million shares of common stock to an employee stock owner plan that could make any takeover more difficult. The stock, about 5 percent of the company's outstanding shares, was added to 11 percent already held by an employee profit-sharing plan. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>, which paid $ 13.3 billion to buy <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> four years ago, has seen its stock climb in recent weeks on rumors of a possible takeover bid, with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> mentioned as a likely suitor. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> received $ 3 billion in an out-of-court settlement of its lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> over <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 and observers have been watching closely to see what the company would do with its windfall. <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> had sued <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> claiming <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s 1984 acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> interfered with its plans to buy part of <LOCATION> Getty </LOCATION>. In 1985 a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> jury awarded <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> $ 10.3 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> appealed but eventually settled with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> for the smaller amount. `` Over the past several months, your management and board of directors have reviewed numerous business situations in an effort to find an investment opportunity similar to <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>'s former stake in <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>,'' said the letter signed by <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Liedtke </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Randal </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>. `` After thorough study, we have concluded that <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> is by far the most appealing company in the entire spectrum and particularly in its peer group.'' Noting <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>'s profitability has not matched its market position, <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> said, `` <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> has demonstrated expertise in dealing with strictly financial affairs. In the past, it has not seemed to focus that expertise on its operational divisions. If it now does so, we believe the results could be pleasantly surprising.'' <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> said the company had until the end of 1990 to reinvest the money from <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> to avoid tax liabilities. <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> said it believed it could provide `` constructive support'' to <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Derr </PERSON>'s plans to improve the company's performance. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>, rich in oil and gas reserves and a high-performing chemicals unit, had sales in 1988 of $ 28.9 billion, down from $ 29.1 billion in 1987. Earnings last year totaled $ 1.8 billion, or $ 5.17 a share, up about 40 percent from $ 1.3 billion, or $ 3.65 a share. In its latest quarter, <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings edged down to $ 417 million, or $ 1.22 a share, from $ 420 million, or $ 1.23 a share, a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>, whose main business is in motor oil and sulphur, reported third quarter income of $ 35.4 million, or 87 cents per share, compared to $ 39.3 million, 93 cents, for the same period a year ago. Revenue rose to $ 644 million in the third quarter compared to $ 617 million in 1988.

 <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorp </ORGANIZATION>, hammered by loan losses at out-of-state subsidiaries, said Thursday it would speed up its program to sell bad loans in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and add $ 400 million to its reserves to cover the costs. First Interstate, whose <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> unit lost $ 174 million last quarter and whose <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> subsidiary also has shown big losses in the past, also said it intended to offer 7.5 million shares of new common stock to raise about $ 400 million. First Interstate, the nation's largest retail banking system with offices in 21 states, said the program will cut the costs of carrying the bad loans. That, combined with existing unused tax benefits, should provide up to $ 367 million of potential future tax benefits, the company said. Of the $ 400 million in added reserves, $ 300 million was to go toward the program to eliminate the bad loans in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and another $ 100 million `` to address the risk inherent in the company's real estate portfolio.'' First Interstate showed a loss of $ 15.5 million last quarter, or 57 cents per share, after its <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> took a $ 350 million provision for loan losses due to plunging real estate values in the state.

<HEAD>Analyst: Government Report Sees `Potential Problems' At Drug Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The price of <ORGANIZATION> Abbott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> stock slipped Thursday after a brokerage firm said a government report showed one of the company's drug plants might be `` a little sloppy'' in adhering to federal standards. <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> stock closed at $ 67.12 -LCB- a share, down $ 1.25, in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. `` We did n't tell people to sell, we just said here is some information about something that is going on,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Harshbarger </PERSON>, vice president and senior health care analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a brokerage. A day earlier, <PERSON> Harshbarger </PERSON> obtained through the Freedom of Information Act a copy of a 41-page <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> report on an <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> facility in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> that produces drugs given intravenously. `` Our consultants pointed out where it looked like standards had been becoming a little sloppy _ where it looked like there could be potential problems,'' <PERSON> Harshbarger </PERSON> said. He said 56 citations were listed in the report, written after an <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> inspection July 5 through Nov. 3 at the plant. He said 80 percent of the issues cited were `` nit-picking, minor problems and 20 percent potentially had some serious implications.'' He declined to be specific. <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ekvall </PERSON>, consumer affairs officer at the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> regional office, said: `` The only thing we can say at this point is it's an ongoing investigation. This report is observations, and from it the regulatory people have to determine what type of regulatory action has to be taken.'' <PERSON> Harshbarger </PERSON> said the brokerage firm's sales staff was told in a meeting Thursday morning to advise clients of the report. <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Babington </PERSON> said later Thursday that the report's observations were technical in nature, but she did n't elaborate `` The bottom line for customers and patients is that the products are safe and they are effective for what they are intended to be used for,'' <PERSON> Babington </PERSON> said. She said the plant referred to in the report is `` one small section of one building on an <LOCATION> Abbott </LOCATION> campus that has many, many facilities.''

 Faced with momentous change by its East European neighbors, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> must accelerate its drive for closer economic ties, a top official of the trading bloc said Thursday. `` We are facing the shock of necessity,'' said <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Delors </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the community's executive body. `` We must maintain the community as a magnet ... as a stabilizing factor,'' he told reporters on the eve of a summit of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> leaders in <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. `` This is our historic duty.'' <PERSON> Delors </PERSON> appealed to the leaders to move forward with controversial plans to forge a tighter economic and monetary union of the dozen nations, known as the Common Market. He urged <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> leaders, who will meet Friday and Saturday, to set a date for a special conference to revise the community's founding treaty and create the monetary union. At the summit, the leaders also were expected to discuss plans to adopt a social charter guaranteeing minimum rights to workers in the European-wide market to be established in 1992. Also on the agenda was a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> plan to set up a development bank to provide money to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries adopting political and economic reforms. In addition, the leaders may discuss a proposal announced last month that the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> form a closer relationship with the six <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> countries. Under the proposal by the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION>'s executive commission, the six <ORGANIZATION> EFTA </ORGANIZATION> nations _ <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> _ would gain freedom of movement for people, goods, services and capital with the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION>, in effect creating a vast open European market. <PERSON> Nico </PERSON> <PERSON> Wegter </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> foreign affairs spokesman, said last month the 12 <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers agreed that on Dec. 19, when they meet their <ORGANIZATION> EFTA </ORGANIZATION> colleagues, they should take `` a clear political commitment so that we can begin negotiations next year.'' Cooperation between the two trade blocs also would be strengthened in the areas of research, environment, consumer protection, working conditions, social welfare, education and foreign policy under the proposal. French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, the summit host, wants the <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION> meeting to schedule the inter-governmental conference on monetary union for the second half of 1990. A West German government official said Thursday that Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> _ who wants the conference begun after late 1990 German elections _ would agree to formally launching the conference in December 1990, providing work did not begin until 1991. British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> strongly has opposed radical plans for monetary union, which would lead to a joint currency and a European-wide system of central banks. She also has opposed setting a timetable for the special conference. But <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> was expected to push hard for a decision to hold the conference next fall. `` It is on this that the success or failure of the <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION> summit will be judged,'' said a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> official in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, demanding anonymity. `` It is a risk, but the situation in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> forces us to take it.'' <PERSON> Delors </PERSON> and others argue that the upheavals in the East require the Common Market to move more quickly in uniting on economic and other issues. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has urged the trading bloc to be `` a magnet that draws the forces of reform forward in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' But Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> argues that the sweeping plans for monetary union would require governments to surrender some of their sovereignty. She reiterated her opposition at Monday's <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, saying such a system `` is not a step toward democracy but a step away from it.'' French officials were worried that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would hesitate in supporting full European integration. The opening of borders between East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, has raised concern that <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s attention may shift to its Eastern neighbors French Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> said <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> expected <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to show `` irrefutable proof'' of its support for European integration. A West German source, demanding anonymity, said at the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> gathering that `` We must make clear in <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is interested in the further economic and monetary integration of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' Moves for a monetary union have added another dimension to the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s plans to fashion a single market by the end of 1992. By then, the nations want to remove the many trade barriers that prevent the free movement of people, goods, services and money. The special conference would be needed to revise the Treaty of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, which set up the Common Market in 1957. The treaty would have to be altered to put into effect some of the recommendations for closer monetary ties, made in a report by a group of central bankers. The report proposed setting up a new agency to make and implement monetary policy and to manage exchange rate policy. It also recommended that a single currency eventually be created, with each nation abandoning its present currency. At a June summit in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> leaders agreed to proceed with the first stage of a three-part plan. The first stage, scheduled to begin July 1, would link all the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> currencies to the European monetary mechanism that keeps exchange rates for those currencies roughly stable within a certain range. The currencies of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> are not now part of that system.

<HEAD>Dollar Up, Share Prices Fall</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar was up against the Japanese yen Friday morning, while share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> declined in morning trading. The dollar closed the morning session at 144.23 yen, down from its opening of 144.32 yen but up 0.12 yen from Thursday's close here of 144.13 yen. It was traded in a narrow range of 144.21 to 144.40 yen. The dollar's higher opening in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> followed a similar overnight upswing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where it ended at 144.30 yen. The mark was dropping back against the dollar after sales of the German currency by <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> speculators in <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Minori </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeuchi </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Some speculators in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> seemed to be waiting until the dollar rose more before selling to buy yen, <PERSON> Takeuchi </PERSON> said. Japanese Finance Minister <PERSON> Ryutaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashimoto </PERSON> indicated a relative lack of concern with the dollar's strength above the 144.00 yen level at a regular press conference Friday morning. `` Inside a delicate situation we are taking a delicate look,'' he said. The remark was seen as indicating the ministry is not alarmed by the dollar's recent rise. Most market players were awaiting the release of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jobless rate for November due out in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> later Friday, traders said. On the stock exchange, the 225-issue <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> lost 103.09 points, or 0.27 percent, closing the morning session at 37,755.02. It had gained 203.82 points to a record-high closing of 37,858.11 Thursday. A trader at <ORGANIZATION> Kleinwort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benson </ORGANIZATION> securities said he did n't believe the market's recent rally, in which it advanced for all but 2 of 22 days, had ended despite the drop. `` There are a lot of people still waiting to put money into the market,'' said the trader, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>MeraBank To Get $450 Million Capital Infusion from Pinnacle West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MEL REISNER</BYLINE>

 Federal regulators have approved a $ 450 million capital infusion from <ORGANIZATION> Pinnacle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to its troubled <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, the thrift's chairman said late Wednesday. `` This is an important beginning of the recapitalization of <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION>. It means about $ 45 million a year in interest revenue,'' said Chairman <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>. However, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said the transfer was an ominous sign for <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Serivce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the state's largest public utility and <PERSON> Pinnacle </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>'s only profitable subsidiary for the past two years. Pinnacle West, a $ 13 billion-a-year, Phoenix-based holding company, was founded to run <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION> utility holding company, announced it wanted to buy Pinnacle West in a deal valued at about $ 1.87 billion. The bid, which is conditioned upon Pinnacle West disposing of <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION>, is an expansion of an earlier offer from <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION> to buy <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Pinnacle West created concern in 1986 when it bought <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION> just as the problems that have plagued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> savings and loans became most acute. The acquisition was criticized because of the possibility that the S & amp; L could siphon funds from the utility company, a robust dividend-producer. Pinnacle West has repeatedly denied any shifting of funds among its subsidiaries. `` The settlement announced tonight ... saddles Pinnacle West with additional debt at a time when the company can ill afford it and leaves ownership of <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION> in the hands of Pinnacle West with no assurance that losses will not continue to mount,'' said <PERSON> Renz </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, chairman of the corporation commission, in a statement. He said the regulatory commission was worried about `` the possibility that <LOCATION> Pinnacle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> creditors will look to <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for repayment.'' `` This commission has moved in the past to prevent the parent company from draining the resources of <ORGANIZATION> APS </ORGANIZATION> at the expense of ratepayers, and -LRB- the commission -RRB- will do so again without hesitation or reservation,'' <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> added. Pinnacle West Chairman <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Turley </PERSON> said the company and the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thrift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> agreed that <ORGANIZATION> Pinnacle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> will pay <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION> $ 300 million in cash and accrued interest by March 31, 1990. Pinnacle West also said it will give the thrift an unsecured note for $ 150 million. <PERSON> Turley </PERSON> did not address the concerns over <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Pinnacle </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>'s only company that falls under the direct purview of state regulators. `` We also believe the state of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> is well served by this resolution,'' he said. Pinnacle West has obtained a commitment from <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, all of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, to lend the $ 300 million needed to come up with the first infusion in less than four months, <PERSON> Turley </PERSON> said. He said the assumption of additional debt would require Pinnacle West to renegotiate `` certain existing debt obligations'' for <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary it has placed on the sales block. <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 209 million in 1988 and $ 105 million in the first six months of this year, with a projected loss of about the same amount in the last six months. `` After a very difficult time over the past 18 months, we believe this agreement is in the best interest of Pinnacle West shareholders and will help re-establish the company's position in the financial community,'' <PERSON> Turley </PERSON> said.
