 An explosion on an oil tanker docked at a loading platform in the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Sound Wednesday night knocked several people into the water, authorities said, and at least one person was missing. The blast shook the area and could be heard for miles around at about 10 p.m. `` I've never experienced an earthquake but it must be something like this,'' police Sgt. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Iannone </PERSON> said. `` We've had several residents report that their windows were blown out.'' The Coast Guard was searching the water for a missing person, Chief Warrant Officer <PERSON> Myron </PERSON> <PERSON> Verville </PERSON> said. He said he was unaware of any injuries. The tanker, the <PERSON> Fiona </PERSON>, was unloading oil, which is then piped to the <LOCATION> Northport </LOCATION> plant of the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Geisinger </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Northport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The platform is located about 2 miles north of the plant in the Sound, he said. `` We have reports of people in the water and scuba divers are out there trying to find them,'' <PERSON> Geisinger </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Geisinger </PERSON> and county police said the explosion did not start a fire. But it could be felt more than 10 miles away, said <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Police Officer <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Droscoski </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Golden </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said he had received reports of the explosion but did not have details.

 The jury in the McMartin Pre-School molestation trial may not hear about a romance between a social worker who gathered evidence from children in the case and a newscaster who covered the story, a judge ruled Wednesday. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Pounders </PERSON> said the defense had not shown that it was relevant to the trial. The defense had suggested that <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Satz </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> KABC </ORGANIZATION> reporter, influenced the interviews that <PERSON> Kee </PERSON> <PERSON> MacFarlane </PERSON> conducted with children from the preschool as part of her job at Children's <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> The attorneys also argued that her credibility might be damaged if jurors knew about the relationship. `` I do n't see from what's been presented that there's a substantial issue for the jury,'' <PERSON> Pounders </PERSON> said after hearing Ms. <PERSON> MacFarlane </PERSON> testify about the relationship outside the presence of the jury. Ms. <PERSON> MacFarlane </PERSON>, whose testimony in pretrial hearings concerned her use of games and picture coloring to get children to talk of the alleged abuse, told the judge that her romance with <PERSON> Satz </PERSON> began after the interviews were completed. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, 30, and his mother, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> McMartin </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, 61, are on trial on 100 molestation and conspiracy charges linked to their now defunct <ORGANIZATION> McMartin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pre-School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. The case has been in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> courts for five years. `` We're not trying to demonstrate that <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Satz </PERSON> obtained information from <PERSON> Kee </PERSON> <PERSON> MacFarlane </PERSON> to enhance his career,'' said defense attorney Dean Gits. `` What we're trying to show is that <PERSON> Kee </PERSON> <PERSON> MacFarlane </PERSON> had a relationship with <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Satz </PERSON> to enhance her career.'' Ms. <PERSON> MacFarlane </PERSON> has denied being a source for <PERSON> Satz </PERSON>'s stories broadcast on <ORGANIZATION> KABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> on the <PERSON> McMartin </PERSON> case, although she acknowledged Wednesday that they discussed it at the time. <PERSON> Satz </PERSON>, who is no longer with the television station, sat in the courtroom while Ms. <PERSON> MacFarlane </PERSON> was questioned. But <PERSON> Pounders </PERSON> ruled he was protected from testifying by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s news reporter shield law. <PERSON> Pounders </PERSON> said that although `` the relationship has an impact on the case,'' he would allow only general testimony about the affair during Wednesday's hearing and no exploration of minute details, which he said would be prejudicial and might violate Ms. <PERSON> MacFarlane </PERSON>'s privacy rights. He also limited testimony to late 1983 to March 1984, when Ms. <PERSON> MacFarlane </PERSON> ended her interviews with children and indictments were issued. He is previewing the testimony before jurors hear it. Ms. <PERSON> MacFarlane </PERSON> said they met when <PERSON> Satz </PERSON> came to interview her for a general story on child molestations. In late 1983, before stories about the case broke, Ms. <PERSON> MacFarlane </PERSON> said she received a phone message from <PERSON> Satz </PERSON> saying he wanted to discuss <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, who would later become a defendant. She said she turned to a co-worker, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Krebbs </PERSON>, and said, `` My God, <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON>, he's gotten wind of the case.'' `` He knew a lot of things about this case,'' she said. `` Some of them were things I knew. Some were things I did n't know.'' At another point she said, `` I remember being shocked at what kind of information he had. It was startling to me. He seemed to know everything.'' `` Did you ever become boyfriend and girlfriend with <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Satz </PERSON>?'' Gits asked Ms. <PERSON> MacFarlane </PERSON>. `` Yes,'' she answered after a brief pause. `` When, in your best estimation, did that happen?'' he asked. `` It was after March 1984,'' she said, but added she could not be sure because `` relationships evolve over time.'' Ms. <PERSON> MacFarlane </PERSON> did not say when the relationship ended. She has since married someone else. <PERSON> Satz </PERSON> was fired by <ORGANIZATION> KABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> last year in a dispute unrelated to the <PERSON> McMartin </PERSON> case.

<HEAD>Santana Strikes Chord in Musical Scene after Two Decades</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 When jazz great <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> recently praised the originality of <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santana </PERSON>, the low-key musician expressed satisfaction that he still strikes a singular chord on the musical scene after two decades. `` For Miles to tell me this, hey, that's a great compliment, but it shows that I'm not on stagnant water,'' said <PERSON> Santana </PERSON>, who's admired for his stirring guitar solos `` Stagnant water stinks. You need water to go out, you need water to come in _ all the time. And in order to do it, you have to become a student. Once you have a master's and you know everything, it's a drag.'' To keep his music flowing, <PERSON> Santana </PERSON> will release a three-record LP early next month and has launched a tour that reunites <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Rolie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> `` Chepito'' Areas and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrieve </PERSON>, three original members of the band that evolved during jam sessions in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s heavily Hispanic Mission District. The <ORGANIZATION> Santana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION> made its debut in 1968 at the Fillmore West where <PERSON> Santana </PERSON> recently held court at a small side table overlooking busy <PERSON> Geary </PERSON> <PERSON> Street </PERSON>, talking about his new album, the feelings behind his music and the popularity of Latin-rhythm groups. The Mexican-born <PERSON> Santana </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> in 1961, entering the national spotlight with a show-stopping performance at <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> in 1969. He has gone on to earn 14 gold albums, nine platinum albums and sell more than 25 million records worldwide. Despite a pocketful of popular hits _ including `` Evil Ways,'' `` Black Magic Woman,'' `` Oye Como Va,'' `` Soul Sacrifice'' and `` Europa'' _ the 41-year-old <PERSON> Santana </PERSON> has continued experimenting. The new anthology, including some unreleased cuts, serves to `` give a testimony of the things we have become and lived.'' `` We're looking to take the music further. I mean, play the music and respect it for the way you play it, but also embrace the future and take some new chances,'' said the slender, mustachioed <PERSON> Santana </PERSON>. `` We want to serve the people with our music,'' he said. `` Music is a healing force if played correctly. I really believe that, aside from being the universal language, it's a healing force and reminds us that we have more things in common than we think.'' For <PERSON> Santana </PERSON>, who began playing guitar at age 8, music has never been a strictly commercial endeavor. `` Music is not to make a living,'' he said. `` Music is to help the conditioning of life. People play for many different reasons and all of them according to their heart's capacity. My capacity tells me that I can do a great service by doing music correctly. People know when you're playing something from your heart and when you're just giving lip service.'' Before <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Estefan </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Sound Machine began doing the `` Conga'' and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lobos </LOCATION> started playing `` Tex-Mex,'' <PERSON> Santana </PERSON> was infusing his music with the `` Latin rhythm.'' In past cuts such as `` Samba Pa Ti,'' `` Oye Como Va'' and `` Black Magic Woman,'' <PERSON> Santana </PERSON> showcased `` salsa'' when it was still considered something to add to Mexican dishes. Still, most of the recent publicity surrounding Hispanic-theme movies _ `` <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bamba </LOCATION>,'' `` Stand and Deliver'' and `` Milagro Beanfield War'' _ and Latin-rhythm musical groups fail to even mention <PERSON> Santana </PERSON>. `` For <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Estefan </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lobos </LOCATION> and all the other Spanish-speaking people today, if they want to go to the future, they got to go through me first,'' <PERSON> Santana </PERSON> said. On the other hand, <PERSON> Santana </PERSON> expressed satisfaction his music has not been easily categorized, and points out his innovative music has endured for two decades. `` I consider myself a musician and a stylist, in bringing forth a certain thing that all generations can relate to,'' he said. `` That's better for me than being something mega-everything for three years.'' The new album, titled `` <PERSON> Viva </PERSON> <PERSON> Santana </PERSON>!,'' is the latest of 25 LPs released during his career. He also cut albums with Buddy Miles and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>. The tour began on Aug. 26 at <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash </LOCATION>. Some scheduled stops include <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Tiber Lovers Try To Turn The Tide For Rome's Polluted River</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Smelly sewage notwithstanding, the <LOCATION> Tiber </LOCATION> is having a renaissance. Once the river was the lifeline of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. From ancient times to just a century ago, Romans bathed, fished and washed their clothes in it. <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s unplanned development boom after World War II, however, proved too much for the river. In 20 years, the population swelled from 1 million to more than 3 million. Anyone foolish enough to swim in the Tiber risks fatal infection from the untreated sewage that pours into it daily. Today's Romans do n't have the habit of going down to the river _ a stroll there means sidestepping broken bottles, rats and syringes discarded by drug addicts. But this summer gave Tiber lovers hope the tide is turning their way in the battle against pollution and neglect. With an eye on developing tourist attractions for 1990, when <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> hosts the World Cup soccer games, the city offered free boat rides during July. The response was so great that the promotion was extended into September. Tickets sold out for sunset cruises to the romantic setting of a play performed at the Roman amphitheater at <LOCATION> Ostia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antica </LOCATION>, the Tiber's ancient port. Hot, breezeless nights found young Romans playing cards and dancing on <LOCATION> Tiberina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` The fish will return, there will be pleasure boats. This is n't the Thames, but there's reason to believe the Tiber can be made livable for flora and flauna,'' said <PERSON> Aurelio </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Misiti </PERSON>, a sanitary engineer and professor at <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sapienza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> His department works closely with the city on <LOCATION> Tiber </LOCATION> projects. While dictator <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Mussolini </PERSON> had declared the river contaminated and banned swimming and transport in 1924, <PERSON> Misiti </PERSON> noted, postwar governments did n't get around to prohibiting the dumping of sewage into it until 1976. `` In 1974, <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> started building the first purification plant,'' <PERSON> Misiti </PERSON> said in an interview. `` Now there are four plants, but they can only handle a bit less than half the discharge, and that's just talking about urban waste, not industry's, which is supposed to be handled by the factories themselves.'' The sewage treatment program was supposed to have been completed years ago. <PERSON> Misiti </PERSON> said it should be finished by 1992 and `` after that the Tiber should return to normal.'' Just outside the city, fisherman pull in edible catch from the river, which begins its 251-mile course in the <LOCATION> Etruscan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Apennines </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Paola </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruggeri </PERSON> of the World Wildlife Fund says the city for the most part does n't enforce regulations forcing factories to purify their wastes before spilling them into the Tiber. Since 1982, her group has rented from the city a stretch of riverbank and intends to keep it as a green oasis. Willows, poplars, even a fig tree, lean out to the water, making that stretch look more like <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> than a river channeled through a noisy, traffic-plagued international city. `` Every week volunteers come to clean it and every week we find a mountain of garbage,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ruggeri </PERSON> said. Until about a century ago, the city spilled down to the river banks, leaving <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> vulnerable to devastating floods, roughly every couple of hundred years. After many suggestions, including those of <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Garibaldi </PERSON>, the unification hero, the government began walling off the <LOCATION> Tiber </LOCATION> and demolishing buildings at river-level. Now pedestrians and cars move along, at bridge-deck level, with the Tiber's murky green waters are out of sight below. Earlier this year, when the city planned its annual April 21 celebrations of the legendary founding of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Romulus </PERSON> along the left bank of the <LOCATION> Tiber </LOCATION>, it hosted an exhibit about excavations done in the last 10 years, when the river became a distinct department within the city's Superintendency of Archaeology. Tourists walking along the river can see the excavation of a three-level storehouse for jars of oil, wine and fish sauce left dockside by barges at the ancient port near what is now <LOCATION> Testaccio </LOCATION>, a blue-collar workers' neighborhood. `` In the past, the city lived on its river. <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> was a kind of <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> or a <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Claudio </PERSON> <PERSON> Mocchegiani </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpano </PERSON>, head of the city's underwater archaeology department. `` A thousand years from now, when they dig up artifacts from the 20th century, they'll find out that the Tiber just ran through <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and served as a sewer,'' <PERSON> Carpano </PERSON> said.

 In the narrow and crowded lanes of the old bazaar, a 25-inch-tall man sits in a store selling candy and hoping to find a wife. `` It is a hard life to be a dwarf, and to be the world's shortest living matured man is even harder,'' <PERSON> Gul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> said in his whispery voice as he counted coins and handed sweets to children much taller than he <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> is 3.3 inches shorter than the shortest living adult listed by the 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Domingo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. `` No one noticed me before, until a local newspaper reporter had a chance meeting with a friend of mine, who told her about me,'' <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON>, 32, said in an interview Tuesday. He is the eldest of four children of <PERSON> Noor </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fatma </PERSON> <PERSON> Begum </PERSON>. `` My first issue were twins, <PERSON> Gul </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zahoor </PERSON>. Both were dwarfs,''' <PERSON> Fatma </PERSON> said in her one-room home in the <LOCATION> Ballimaran </LOCATION> district of <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Zahoor </PERSON> died after four years, but <PERSON> Gul </PERSON> lived to become a man.'' Her other children, a boy and a girl, grew to normal size. <PERSON> Gul </PERSON>, which means flower in the <LOCATION> Urdu </LOCATION> language, is lonely and wants to get married. He was 10 when his father died. His mother soon remarried, and <PERSON> Gul </PERSON> was sent to live with his maternal uncle, where he stays today. `` I want to marry someone who is of normal height so that she can carry me around, feed me and give me bath. ... I do not want to live on the charity of my relatives forever,'' he said. His arms are so short that his hands `` ca n't reach his head while bathing,'' said his aunt, <PERSON> Nargis </PERSON> <PERSON> Begum </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> started his candy business with an investment of about $ 35, but he has been robbed twice. `` I could not do anything. I have decided when I marry I will ask my wife to sit with me in the candy store,'' he said with a broad smile. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON>, whose only vice is smoking, giggles constantly. `` I used to get very upset when people laughed at me, but I figured out if I laughed back that fixes them,'' he said. `` Being the shortest man is not a joke. It is a hard existence,'' <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> said. Walking is difficult for <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON>, who pays about 30 cents a day to teen-agers who piggyback him where he wants to go. `` I ca n't get onto a rickshaw or sit on a bicycle. It is difficult to balance,'' he said. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON>'s neighbors are fond of him. `` He is our pride. When he becomes world-famous, we will all be very, very happy,'' said <PERSON> Ashraf </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizvi </PERSON>, a travel agent who brought <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> to the attention of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON>'s uncle, <PERSON> Manzoor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON>, said a circus once tried to buy him. `` I would have gladly agreed to let <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> work in the circus but to lose him forever is something impossible.'' He said the circus offered the equivalent of $ 14,285 for <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON>, a staggering amount in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> where the per capita annual income is $ 290. <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> hopes <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> will find a bride. `` But who will marry him? Maybe one day when he is famous someone will come and offer him her hand,'' the uncle said. `` But the problem is that <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> wants a normal-height women, not a dwarf like him.''

 A burned and terrified German girl, not yet in her teens, asked of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers holding her, `` Am I going to die? Am I going to die?'' `` I just ca n't get that face out of my mind,'' one of them said later. A young airman said <PERSON> God </PERSON> helped him save injured people after the crash Sunday at the <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION> air show. A woman told of the anguish she felt when her husband was assigned to retrieve the remains of victims. The unofficial <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Stars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stripes </ORGANIZATION> published an account Tuesday of moving stories told at `` grief clinic'' that was closed to other news media. City Editor <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Luman </PERSON> said a reporter from the newspaper attended the clinic on the condition that the participants not be identified. `` One of the tech sergeants from my squadron was holding a 10-to 12-year-old German girl,'' a soldier said. `` She was burned, but I could n't tell how bad. `` She just kept looking at me asking ` Am I going to die? Am I going to die?' And I could n't tell her one way or the other, so I just kept looking at her and saying: ` You're all right. You'll be fine.' And she kept screaming for her mom. And I just ca n't get that face out of my mind.'' A 21-year-old airman said: `` I was actually putting my hands inside their backs and sides to keep their veins shut. I think God put my feeling aside so that I could get in there and help.'' Tears welled in a woman's eyes as she told of her husband's assignment to collect the remains `` I knew he had to talk about it,'' she said. `` I did n't want to talk about it, but I knew I had to. I'm here for me, but I'm here for him, too.'' 1st Lt. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sattler </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Air Base at <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION>, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the general news media were not invited to the session Monday because, `` after all, this was aimed at healing the people involved.''

Its report said: `` Survivors spoke of experiencing depression, lack of sleep, loss of appetite, decreasing interest in things they usually do, guilt and recurring visions. And they cried.''

 Women's groups and other organizations are demanding compulsory AIDS tests for the thousands of foreigners who will visit <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for the Olympics. The groups contend the influx of visitors could spread acquired immune deficiency syndrome in a nation that has reported just a few AIDS cases and enacted tough laws to curb the spread of the disease. `` It must be compulsory for all foreign visitors during the Olympic period to show medical certificates confirming they are free from the disease,'' said So Mi-yong of the Women's Hot Line. The government, worried about offending foreigners, has said there will be no mandatory AIDS tests. Health officials say it would be impossible to test the 200,000 expected visitors. Health authorities have reported two AIDS deaths and about 30 cases of the AIDS virus, mainly among prostitutes, since the first case was reported in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in 1985. But Olympics authorities and government officials are adopting a number of measures to try to ensure the Games do not expose the nation to AIDS any more than is necessary. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> residents have been receiving handbills headlined `` AIDS'' and warning people that they must take every precaution to avoid the disease. `` It is a horrible disease that can not be stopped by any method except preventative measures,'' the leaflet warns. City health officials said the warning was being distributed on the eve of the Olympics to raise public awareness before the visitors arrive. Leaflets are being sent to all households in the city of 10 million people. The pamphlet makes no reference to the Olympics, but it does say the first diagnosed case discovered in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was an American. It also stresses the high number of AIDS cases overseas. Free condoms will be distributed at the Olympic Athletes Village that will house 13,000 athletes and officials, officials said. Officials did not know if condoms would be provided to the 6,000 journalists in the Press Village. Health authorities and police will watch the city's prostitutes during the Olympics to make sure they have been tested for AIDS as required by law, officials say. `` We will be taking special measures during the Olympics,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung-woo </PERSON>, director general of the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> officials also have conducted a public education campaign in recent months to alert the public to AIDS. Posters have been put up in subways and other places. But some civic groups and opposition lawmakers say the measures are not enough. They contend the only certain defense against the disease is to require all foreigners to prove they are not infected with AIDS. National Assemblyman Park <PERSON> Sil </PERSON> called for mandatory testing of all foreigners coming to the Olympics. `` There is no guarantee they wo n't bring this deadly disease,'' he said. Women's groups say it is unfair to test prostitutes and not foreigners who may infect them. Civic groups formed a council to press for mandatory testing. `` It is ridiculous to require AIDS tests only on hostesses with frequent contacts with foreigners,'' said Ms. So of the Women's Hot Line. Tough laws were enacted this year to limit the spread of AIDS. The law allows authorities to monitor and regulate people infected with AIDS or the AIDS virus. Under the law, people with AIDS who have intercourse without using protection such as condoms face up to three years in prison, officials have the power to isolate AIDS sufferers, and doctors who fail to report cases face jail terms. Most South Koreans see AIDS as a `` foreign'' disease and insist their nation can be spared if controls are imposed on foreigners. The government has rejected demands for mandatory AIDS tests for foreigners for fear of offending other nations and discouraging business and tourism. Health officials admit it is only a matter of time before AIDS spreads in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and testing of foreigners would do little to stop the disease. The government hopes its public campaigns will do more to limit its spread.

<TEXT>
 The white-led government has released the names of 801 people held without charge for at least 30 days under state-of-emergency regulations. The great majority are black. The list, released Tuesday, includes many prominent anti-apartheid activists who have been held for most or all of the state of emergency declared on June 12, 1986. Among them are <PERSON> Zwalakhe </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, editor of the black-oriented newspaper <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Morobe </PERSON>, chief spokesman for the now-banned <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> coalition. Virtually all the detainees on the list are black, but among them are a handful of whites. The only white held for the entire emergency is <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Suttner </PERSON>, a law lecturer at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witwatersrand </ORGANIZATION>. The government is not required to report the names of detainess held less than 30 days and has never issued comprehensive figures for the number of detentions during the emergency. Monitoring groups estimate that 30,000 people have been held for varying periods.

 A mother said she asked the court for leniency on behalf of the drunken driver who killed her son because the 21-year-old former soldier deserved the chance to change his ways. <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON> granted <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s request and ordered <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON> to serve 90 days in jail <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON> suspended the rest of a five-year prison term and placed him on five years' probation. Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said it had been hard to accept the loss of her 25-year-old son, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>, in such an accident. `` I feel like the most important thing in my life has been taken away from me,'' she told the judge Monday. `` Every time I go by ... I'll be reminded of where my son died, and that hurts very much. `` But I feel like Mr. <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON> is very young, too, and he should have the chance to maybe change his ways.'' <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, had been charged with second-degree manslaughter. But in July he pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of reckless homicide as part of an agreement with Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Wine </PERSON>. The accident occurred Dec. 12 as <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON> was driving the wrong direction in the westbound lanes of the <ORGANIZATION> Gene </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freeway </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>'s pickup collided with <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s car, and <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> died at the scene of multiple injuries. A test showed <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>'s blood-alcohol level was 0.14 percent, above the state's 0.1 percent at which a person is presumed intoxicated. At the urging of <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s mother, Wine had recommended that <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON> be placed on probation so he could give public talks about the dangers of drunken driving. <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>, who had been stationed at <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knox </ORGANIZATION>, was discharged from the Army this month, primarily because of the accident, said defense attorney <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>.

 A grass and brush fire raged out of control Tuesday afternoon, quickly destroyed five expensive homes and badly damaged two others. The blaze was controlled about two hours after it began in this rural community about 20 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said Fire Capt. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Holm </PERSON>. There were no reports of injuries. <ORGANIZATION> Orinda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dashnor </PERSON> said police and fire investigators are canvassing the area to check out second-hand reports that a teen-ager was seen shortly before the fire carrying a bottle rocket, a homemade fireworks device. Several people reported hearing sounds like firecrackers minutes before the blaze broke out, said <PERSON> Holm </PERSON>. `` We are investigating it as a suspicious fire, but the cause has not been determined,'' he added. Five houses, each worth about $ 1 million, were destroyed and two others had an undetermined amount of damage, said Fire Chief <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>. Many residents were not at home when the fire broke out. The flames rapidly spread through the dry brush and tree-covered hills, destroying several houses in just minutes. About 10 acres were burned, said firefighter <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopp </PERSON>, whose 33-year-old home was destroyed in the blaze, said several children helped her rescue her four dogs from the flames. The only property she and husband, <PERSON> Al </PERSON>, were able to save was a desk containing money and insurance papers. `` This has been the worst time of my life,'' she said `` What do you do after all these years?'' <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Artist </PERSON>, a homeowner and 18-year resident, said the fire came within yards of her home. `` The hills are steep, and when the wind comes up, it makes those hills like chimneys with flames just coming right up them,'' Artist said. Shifting winds, gusting up to 22 mph, made it difficult for firefighters to contain the blaze. The fire shifted directions several times because of the winds, officials said. `` One time it's going down the hills, then seconds later it's going up the hills faster than it came down,'' Artist said <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Cechettini </PERSON>, 16, was napping when her sister woke her up and told her about the fire. `` I looked out the kitchen and there was this huge flame wall and I thought for sure our house was gone,'' said <PERSON> Cechettini </PERSON>, whose hair was filled with ashes. Only the roof of the Cechettini's home burned. The homes were situated among grassland dotted by patches of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> scrub oaks, pine and eucalyptus trees and low-lying bushes.

 Japanese attitudes toward marriage, divorce and the family are changing but the American model is an unattractive one, young adults from both countries said at a cultural exchange. Thirty university students from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and 30 from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, ranging in age from 17 to 25, compared cultural and social traditions at a gathering that produced strong criticism from both sides of the high <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> divorce rate. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1985 had five divorces and 10.2 marriages per 1,000 people. Comparable Japanese figures were 1.39 divorces and 6.2 marriages per 1,000. `` Americans seem so crazy about kids, but when they divorce are n't they forgetting about the children?'' said <PERSON> Tadakatsu </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsuruno </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> at the daylong session last week in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> co-sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Nihon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Keizai </ORGANIZATION>, a Japanese economic newspaper, and <ORGANIZATION> Konica </ORGANIZATION>, the photographic and electronics company. The Japanese, from 11 universities, were winners of an essay contest on the two countries' roles in the world. The Americans were engaged in Japanese or other foreign studies at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> universities. University of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> student <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> said the high <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> divorce rate `` is a sign of how individualism has gone out of control'' in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He called it `` individualism with no altruism.'' But despite their criticism of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trends, Tsuruno and other Japanese said things also are changing at home. `` The Japanese attitude to marriage is approaching the American way ... with people thinking more for themselves,'' Tsuruno noted. `` We still have arranged marriages, but 99 percent of my generation will find wives by themselves.'' <PERSON> Noriko </PERSON> <PERSON> Takahashi </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> medical student, said she will make the final decision on her future husband although she will consult with her parents. She said that if someone simply wants romance, `` you can have it without marriage. But the reason for marriage is to have children and propagate generation after generation'' of the family. <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Pochop </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s divorce rate is likely to rise as Japanese women acquire the ability to support themselves. Without it, she said, many Japanese wives are forced to accept their husbands' liaisons with other women, `` a situation <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women would find intolerable.'' A moderator, Prof. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s divorce rate is rising, with more older women divorcing after raising their children to adulthood.

<HEAD>Judge Says HUD Must Consider Homeless When Selling Foreclosed

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> must consider the needs of the homeless before the agency auctions off government-owned, foreclosed homes to the highest bidder, a federal judge says. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> temporarily barred <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday from selling 170 single-family homes in the metropolitan <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> area. The sale was scheduled for today. Last week, another federal judge in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> blocked <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> from selling 200 foreclosed homes in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. The actions are part of a broader effort to force the federal government to make some of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s inventory of 47,000 foreclosed houses available to the homeless. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, in issuing his temporary restraining order, said <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> had violated federal laws by refusing to make a survey of its stock of buildings and properties and determine which might be transferred to non-profit groups that provide services for the homeless. He also said <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> has not complied with the law which calls for `` the realization as soon as feasible of the goal of a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family.'' `` <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> can not just sell to the highest bidder,'' he said. `` The government can not not just consider the amount of revenue coming in.'' <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said his temporary restraining order would last until Sept. 14 while Judge <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON>, who has jurisdiction over the case, schedules further action. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> is acquiring foreclosed properties at a rate of about 7,000 each month. Because it has been selling between 6,000 and 7,000 of the properties monthly, the agency has accumulated a `` rolling inventory'' of about 47,000 homes, the largest backlog in its history. The surge in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s stock of properties reflects a rash of foreclosures on properties in the oil-producing states, and an increase in the overall volume of homes insured by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> in the wake of lower interest rates two years ago.

<TEXT>
 U.S.-Soviet relations were in a whirlwind of confusion even before Polish workers staged their latest occupation strikes. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is engaged in the always disorienting process of choosing a new president. And the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is emerging from a tumultuous <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference filled with boisterous calls for economic reform and greater democratization. `` Not only is it a period of great flux, but as far as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is concerned, it is in the most fluid state since the -LRB- 1917 Russian -RRB- revolution,'' said <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Albright </PERSON>, the chief foreign policy adviser to Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Albright </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, is an expert on <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> relations and a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The latest Polish upheaval poses, loud and clear, one of the unanswered questions about the reform program of <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>: How much political power are communist authorities willing to hand over to their people in return for a popular commitment to invigorate the economy? The wrong answer from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> to that question will present the next American president with a dilemma. `` The problem that the next president is going to have to decide is whether to continue to demand perfection from the Soviet bloc, or whether to just declare victory and accept any change for the better. And there is no question that things are getting better,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hough </PERSON>, a Soviet expert at <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` It seems that everybody is holding his breath,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairbanks </PERSON> of the <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> center for advanced international studies. `` There is a marked movement toward detente, but no one is sure how much momentum it has.'' A new explosion of violence in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> could delay or derail the train. Two weeks ago Polish workers, with their backs to the economic wall, began a second wave of occupation strikes this year, demanding that the government recognize and negotiate with the banned Solidarity trade union. The strikes forced Polish leaders to meet today with Solidarity's leader, <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, with whom they had vowed not to negotiate since releasing him from martial law internment in 1982. Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> has introduced reforms which, like <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program, loosen central controls and allow a greater role for market forces. But the Polish reforms have not stimulated the economy: production remains sluggish and the foreign debt has risen to $ 40 billion. The government's decision to meet with <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> could be a major step on the road toward a healthier <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has been silent on the Polish predicament, but he said in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> earlier this year that there were many paths to socialism. Many people interpreted that to mean the Soviets would not force Polish communists to smash a resurgent Solidarity, as they did in the military crackdown of December 1981. The head of the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade union, <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, last week urged the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to invoke provisions of the new trade bill calling for sanctions against nations that violate workers' rights. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s communist authorities `` should be denied access to the American market under those provisions since they are in violation of worker rights,'' <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is desperately trying to break into Western markets and to secure credits from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has lifted most of the sanctions it imposed against <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and is in no hurry to slap them back on just as U.S.-Soviet relations are improving. But new credits are out of the question until <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> stabilizes its political situation. The administration, says <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>, hopes Polish communist authorities can find the path to `` national reconciliation.'' `` Free labor unions can help the Polish economic reform effort, not hinder it, `` Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> says. `` Indeed, it is hard to see how economic reform can succeed without the participation of free trade unions.'' Another State Department official said `` we've been telling the Polish government very consistently that their ability to reform the economy and our ability to support that process will depend on national reconciliation''; in other words, give Solidarity a slice of the political pie. `` That's not ideology, that's practicality. No one is going to accept the kind of austerity needed for economic reform without making sure they get political reforms first,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. This is one area in which the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and the would-be <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration are pretty close, <PERSON> Albright </PERSON> says. Last week, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign urged <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to legalize Solidarity.

<HEAD>Soviets Focusing on Futuristic Submarine Force</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is committed to a highly advanced, nuclear-powered submarine force even though the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> faces the same type of funding woes confronting the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, according to a new blueprint for the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> navy now being studied in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. The blueprint is a book blessed by Fleet Adm. <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorshkov </PERSON>, known as the `` father'' of the modern <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> navy. It envisions submarines that can travel at 50 knots to 60 knots underwater `` in the near term'' and ultimately up to 100 knots, while diving to depths of 6,600 feet and carrying thermal-and laser-homing torpedoes that can travel at 300 knots. The book, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>: Its Role, Prospects for Development and Employment,'' was published in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> earlier this year and is now being translated and analyzed by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION>. That office already has prepared a three-page summary, however, that concludes the book `` in its scope is the most powerful Soviet monograph on the navy since <PERSON> Gorshkov </PERSON>'s ` Sea Power of the State' -LRB- in 1976 -RRB- and is clearly intended to demonstrate why the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> navy must continue the <PERSON> Gorshkov </PERSON> legacy of fielding a high-technology, high-seas navy despite evident fiscal constraints.'' The book apparently was authored by several individuals but was edited and carries a foreword by <PERSON> Gorshkov </PERSON>, for three decades the driving force behind the Soviet navy. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> intelligence office, the book `` offers the West an insight into the future composition and employment of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> navy,'' highlighting `` three key naval missions.'' They include hunting and destroying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and other Western submarines before they could launch their missiles in a war; destroying Western military and economic targets through nuclear strikes from Soviet submarines; `` and destroying hostile naval forces to gain command of the sea around the Eurasian periphery.'' Throughout the book, special attention is given to anti-submarine warfare and the threat posed by American subs, the summary continued. `` The authors project a highly dynamic undersea warfare environment with goals of 2,000-meter -LRB- 6,600 feet -RRB- diving depths; high-speed submarines, 50 to 60 knots in the near term and 100 knots in the out-years; future high-speed torpedoes, 200 to 300 knots, with thermal and laser homing; 50-kilometer -LRB- 30-mile -RRB- anti-submarine warfare missiles; and improved acoustic and non-acoustic submarine sensors.'' A knot is equal to 1.15 miles per hour, meaning the submarines ultimately envisioned by the Soviets would be able to travel 115 mph. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> already has the fastest nuclear-powered submarines in the world; its Alfa and Akula attack subs can exceed 40 knots underwater. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in the past has deliberately eschewed the goal of building faster submarines, preferring instead to emphasize quiet operation. As for the `` strike mission'' of attacking Western targets with submarines, the book makes `` specific reference to ` covert launches from short ranges against targets and areas covered by anti-missile defense systems' in order to decrease reaction time and increase missile survivability,'' the summary said. `` Such comments highlight the potential importance of recent Soviet sea-launched ballistic missile launches to test short-range, short time-of-flight trajectories.'' The book appears to be `` the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> navy's first salvo in staking out its future role in Soviet national security policy under the newly proclaimed defensive doctrine and ` reasonable sufficiency' philosophy,'' the American analysts added. <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and top Soviet defense officials have insisted to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in recent months that they are shifting their military orientation from an offensive to a defensive stance and intend to maintain only a force that is sufficiently large for protection. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> has pressed the Soviets for more details of their plans in several high-level meetings while expressing doubts the Soviets are really changing their offensive-minded doctrine. The new book reflects the current Soviet emphasis on defense by devoting `` considerable attention ... to the defensive roles of the Soviet navy,'' the summary said. The book says, though, that `` naval force composition is likely to continue to emphasize nuclear submarines both for defensive anti-submarine warfare missions and strategic nuclear strike.''

And I think we've all learned something.'' `` It's great to be free,'' daughter <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> said Tuesday, as she relished the lifting of her grounding restrictions. <PERSON> Schulte </PERSON> went on strike July 18 to protest what she said was disrespect and disobedience by her four children, 14-year-old twins <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julie </PERSON>; <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON>, 13; and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>, 8. She hung picket signs and nixed such duties as cooking, cleaning, chauffering and laundering. A possible turning point came recently when she refused to pay for her children's school clothes. Final negotiations Sunday lasted from noon until 6:40 p.m. when the detailed contracts were signed. `` It was very emotional, traumatic,'' said <PERSON> Schulte </PERSON>, 42. `` There was a lot of crying and screaming.'' The family had to take a break when debate became too heated, but the talks resumed after <PERSON> Schulte </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON>, cooked dinner and family members cooled off. Even before the pact was signed, the children were outside celebrating. `` Before I finished writing my name, they were jumping around at the street corner, yelling, ` It's over! It's over!''' the mother said with a smile. `` Yesterday was the best day of my life and I plan to have another one today,'' <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> said Tuesday. But in case anyone gets complacent, the contracts are taped on the walls as reminders. <PERSON> Schulte </PERSON> no longer tells the children what needs to be done but simply has them review their contracts. The handwritten documents contain specific instructions for practically every chore and privilege. For example, the `` rec room'' contract states that parents will provide a recreation room, and all radios, newspaper delivery bags, shoes and jackets will be kept there. It also calls for removal of all cans, bottles and wrappers from the room by 6 p.m. and specifies that failure to obey is punishable by loss of television privileges for one week. The contracts, 11 of them in all, fill a notebook. <PERSON> Schulte </PERSON> had no regrets about the strike and insisted she would have kept the children grounded and out of school if they had not shaped up. `` But I knew they would come around,'' she said. `` I knew I had the hammer.''

<HEAD>Farm Prices up in August but Trend Moderating</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Farm commodity prices as a group were still going up last month, although a new <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report shows that some major items were starting to level off in August. The department's overall price index rose 2.1 percent from July, averaging 13 percent more than in August 1987. Also, the new figures released on Tuesday showed that the index rose only 2.9 percent in July instead of the preliminary reading of 3.6 percent announced a month ago. Since April, as drought cut into this year's harvest prospects, farm commodity prices overall have climbed 10.8 percent. However, there were some indications in the August report that the upward spiral began to weaken. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said in its preliminary report that higher prices for cattle, apples, tomatoes and lettuce contributed most to the August increase, while prices declined for cotton, corn, onions and soybeans. In the earlier months, corn and soybeans helped lead the way for rising prices. However, by late July, widespread rains began to dampen further increases, although the drought of 1988 has not been broken by any means. At the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday grain and soybean futures closed sharply higher, but it was on the strength of new export business, not further crop losses due to drought, analysts said. Moreover, they said, the corn and soybean crops have passed their most critical stages of development. Based on Aug. 1 estimates, this year's corn harvest may drop 37 percent from 1987; wheat, 13 percent; and soybeans 23 percent. `` All feed grain and soybean prices declined from July, but rough -LRB- unmilled -RRB- rice and all wheat prices increased slightly,'' the report said. `` Average prices of beef cattle and calves increased sharply from July but were below the high levels recorded during February through May of this year.'' Prices of some major commodities are based on mid-month averages and then are revised the following month when additional information is available. As a commodity group, prices of feed grains and hay dropped 2.8 percent from July to August, but still averaged 68 percent above a year ago, the report said. Prices of meat animals rose 4.3 percent as a group but averaged 0.6 percent below the year-earlier mark. Beef cattle prices averaged $ 66.40 per 100 pounds of liveweight, up $ 3.20 from July. Hog prices increased $ 1 from July to $ 46.80 in August. Apple prices at the farm level, rose to 26.1 cents per pound in August from 19.7 cents in July and 16 cents a year ago. Lettuce was reported at $ 12.20 per 100 pounds, up from $ 7.62 in July but far below the $ 18 of last year. Tomatoes, at $ 41.70 per 100 pounds, were up from $ 31 in July and $ 17.30 in August 1987. Overall, the August all-crops price index was up 2.3 percent from July, averaging 33 percent above the year-ago level. The August price index for all livestock and livestock products was up 3.4 percent from July and averaged 1.3 percent more than a year earlier. Higher prices for cattle, hogs, milk, turkeys and eggs accounted for the increase from July. Consumer food prices are expected to rise 3 percent to 5 percent this year, compared with a 4.2 percent average increase in 1987. Before the drought took hold, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> was predicting a 1988 food price hike of 2 percent to 4 percent. Department officials have predicted that the drought may add 2 percentage points to food prices in 1989, above the expected increase in inflation, currently forecast at around 4 percent. That could mean a 1989 food price increase in the range of 6 percent to 7 percent. Tuesday's report said: _ Cattle averaged $ 66.40 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally, up from $ 63.20 in July and $ 61.90 reported for August 1987 Those are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef. _ Hogs averaged $ 45.40 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 44.10 in July and $ 58.60 a year earlier _ Corn, at $ 2.66 a bushel, was down from $ 2.72 in July and the average of $ 1.47 per bushel a year earlier _ Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures, averaged $ 3.56 per bushel, compared with $ 3.50 in July and $ 2.36 a year earlier _ Rice averaged $ 7.61 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 7.51 in July and $ 3.74 a year earlier _ Soybeans were $ 8.40 per bushel, compared with $ 8.50 in July and $ 5.02 a year earlier _ Upland cotton was reported at 55.2 cents per pound, compared with 58.6 in July and 63.7 cents in August 1987 _ Eggs were 59.9 cents per dozen, compared with 62.2 cents in July and 51.9 cents a year earlier _ Milk was $ 11.60 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 11.40 in July and $ 12.20 a year earlier _ Broilers were 41.9 cents per pound, live weight, compared with 42.1 cents in July and 31.7 cents a year ago

<HEAD>Government Can't Claim Cross Is `Non-Religious,' Judge Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A huge Christian cross is an inappropriate government war memorial at a Marine base in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, according to a federal judge who says a non-religious monument would be more suitable. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> ruled Tuesday that the 65-foot wooden cross that is lit each night at Camp <PERSON> H.M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> suburbs on <LOCATION> Oahu </LOCATION> must be removed or replaced by a secular symbol. The judge said the cross amounts to an unconstitutional endorsement of religion by the government. The cross was challenged by the Jewish War Veterans of the <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> `` The needless use of means that are inherently religious makes a message of endorsement likely if not unavoidable,'' the judge wrote in his opinion. `` The 65-foot lighted cross on <LOCATION> Bordelon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> at Camp Smith may fairly be considered to convey a message of governmental endorsement of Christianity,'' <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said. `` The use of a cross as a memorial to fallen or missing servicemen is a use of what to some is a religious symbol where a non-religious one likely would have done as well.'' The judge stayed his order for 60 days to give the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> an opportunity to seek another stay from an appellate court while they appeal his decision. The Jewish War Veterans of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> contended in its lawsuit that the wooden cross on a prominent point at the Marine base violated the Constitution's ban on governmental endorsement of a particular religion. The government argued during a hearing in May that the cross, erected 22 years ago, served purely a secular purpose of honoring Marines killed in the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war or are missing in action. But the Jewish veterans' group argued that the cross can not be considered a secular object because it is the `` symbol of the passion, death and resurrection of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>.'' The government did not deny the religious significance of the cross, but said `` the history of the memorial is clear; it was erected as a secular monument.'' <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>, however, noted evidence that the original cross was built in April 1966 for Easter sunrise services and that it was rebuilt, after a fire, in time to be lit at Christmas 1983. `` Unfortunately, the government's choice of the principal and universally recognized symbol of Christianity to achieve a secular goal can not withstand scrutiny in this instance,'' <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said. `` The principal symbol of Christianity, this nation's dominant religion, simply is too laden with religious meaning to be appropriate for a government memorial assertedly free of any religious message.''

 Delays in getting the space shuttle back into operation have led <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> to postpone its most ambitious scientific mission, the launch of the $ 1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that by moving the telescope launch from June 1 next year to Feb. 1, 1990, it can stay on schedule for launching three major scientific probes that are dependent on planets being in favorable position. Those launches are: <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION>, which will map the planet <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>, in April 1989; <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION>, a U.S.-German project to survey Jupiter and its moons, scheduled October 1989; and <PERSON> Ulysses </PERSON>, a cooperative project with the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, in October 1990. The first space shuttle flight since the Challenger exploded in January 1986 has been postponed five times. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said it wo n't set a new date until after a flight readiness review on Sept. 13-14, but that it hopes to make the flight late next month or in early October. The space telescope is in storage, but is costing the space agency $ 7 million a month to keep it in working order. In space, the telescope is expected to be able to look at objects 14 billion light years away _ almost to the beginning of the universe. Ground-based observatories, which must look through Earth's atmospheric veil, can only see light that originated about 2 billion light years ago

<HEAD>Officials Claim Success in Drug Crackdown</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities say a 30-nation narcotics crackdown resulted in more than 1,200 arrests in the past month and should lead to further drug busts in this hemisphere. `` Some operations are still going on,'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutensohn </PERSON>, head of cocaine investigations at the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday. Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and a host of other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and foreign officials said Tuesday that 30 countries had participated in a series of anti-drug trafficking operations this month, primarily in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said authorities seized 11 tons of cocaine and destroyed 244 tons of marijuana, 118,000 coca plants and 13 cocaine laboratories. Authorities also demolished seven hidden airstrips and seized $ 3.8 million in cash, he said. While <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said the effort did not represent victory in the war against drugs, he said the `` cooperative nature'' of the operations represented a new avenue in stamping out trafficking. `` Heretofore, each of the nations of the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> has been pursuing the war on drugs in a more or less unilateral or bilateral fashion,'' he said. The participating countries, all members of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, shared resources and intelligence and, in a few cases, staged cross-border operations. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> did not orchestrate the drug busts, though it did serve as a clearinghouse for data. Instead, each country planned and executed its drug operations, often in concert with other countries. `` By doing it all over at once, you disrupt the operation,'' <PERSON> Gutensohn </PERSON> said. Since many drug traffickers ignore national boundaries, it is vital to close in on traffickers on many fronts, he said. In <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, for instance, military authorities seized cocaine laboratories in the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huallaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> that are used by members of the powerful <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Calli </PERSON> drug cartels, based in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. Cocaine labs also were seized in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> itself, as well as <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. Among some other actions cited by the officials: _ About 100 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardsmen </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> helped border patrol officials inspect vehicles that crossed into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ As a result of information developed abroad, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> officials seized two tons of cocaine and about $ 2 million in cash _ Military officers from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> operated along the joint border _ Officials in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> worked together to seize chemicals used for cocaine at points along the border <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> participated in the operation as a member of the conference, but did not receive any `` centralized intelligence'' from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military dictator, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, has been indicted by two federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has sought his ouster since early this year, applying economic sanctions that have hurt <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s economy. _ European nations and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> stepped up monitoring of vessels, cargo and aircraft arriving from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>

<HEAD>Nixon Was Reluctant To Tape White House Sessions, Former Aide Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s former top aide says the 37th president not only was reluctant to install an extensive taping system in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, but that he quickly lost awareness that his every conversation was being recorded. `` The historiography of the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration will eventually be much the richer as a result of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s decision to tape-record his meetings and telephone conversations,'' writes H.R. <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s onetime chief of staff. `` <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> was not thinking of historians when he made this decision, but they will be the ultimate beneficiaries.'' <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON> discusses the origin of the taping system, which provided the evidence that eventually drove <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> from office in the Watergate scandal, in the summer issue of Prologue, the quarterly publication of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON>'s latest account is much softer in tone and less critical of <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> than when he described the same events in a 1978 book, `` The Ends of Power.'' `` It is amazing to me when I think back to the first days, weeks and months of the taping system's existence how quickly I forgot about it,'' <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON> writes. `` For a short time, I worried that it might not be working, and I dispatched someone to test the machinery. But the worry quickly passed, as did any awareness at all that <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s conversations _ my conversations, often _ were being taped. I think <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> lost his awareness of the system even more quickly than I did.'' That dovetails with <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s own memory that `` initially I was conscious of the taping, but before long I accepted it as part of the surroundings.'' <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON> says his book 10 years ago focused on the Watergate scandal that drove <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> from office in 1974 and that, `` It was unfortunately sensational in many instances where I would have preferred it to be more reasoned and thorough.'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> fired <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON> in April 1973 at the height of the coverup of the break-in at <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in the Watergate complex in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON> served an 18-month prison term for his part in the affair. In the book he said <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> had `` fudged'' the tape story in various ways, `` climaxing with the assertion on television in 1977 that he had ordered me to destroy all of the tapes.'' There is no reference to that in the Prologue article. The former aide said he chose to write about the taping system because the archives next year will release 60 hours of the recordings for public listening. `` <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> abhorred the idea of taping the president's meetings and telephone conversations,'' <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON> writes. He said he and <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> discovered the taping system of his predecessor, <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, on inauguration day and that the new president ordered it removed. The major reason for the system, <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON> says now as before, was <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s failed attempt to halt inaccurate reports that came out of his meetings with various people. Other reasons, he said, were that <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> wanted records for his memoirs and an accurate account of what foreign leaders said to him. `` Something had to be done, both <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and I agreed, to ensure that we possessed an accurate record of what was said in meetings,'' <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON> writes. They had tried using note-takers but quit because they inhibited conversations, and they had tried debriefing visitors as they left the Oval Office. In late 1970 or early 1971, <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON> recalls, word got to <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> that <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> felt he was foolish for not keeping a record of what was going on and that such a record was necessary for memoirs. `` <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> suddenly was receptive to the idea of taping his meetings,'' <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON> says. `` Finally, still reluctantly, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> agreed that taping was the best way.''

 Some state and local <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders say that while <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' Republican rivals have made their grab for the national spotlight, his campaign has been making important organizational gains in the field. Around the country, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> field leaders and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> state and local leaders contend the appearance of flagging momentum on the part of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign is at worst a temporary problem _ a part of the ups and downs of a campaign that will balance in the end. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign officials have said they were devoting much of their summer efforts to building organization in the states, and party officials in some key states point to organizational gains. `` Now is the time for quiet organizational activity that does n't get much publicity but pays off at the end,'' said <PERSON> Lanny </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, Democratic national committeeman from <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has put together perhaps the best field organization ever put together by a presidential candidate. None of that gets headlines, but you'll see evidence of it in the fall.'' In <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, a critical industrial state, party spokeswoman <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> said the party has hired 15 field coordinators to work with the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign. `` We are getting everything into place in the grass roots, and that's where this election will be won,'' she said. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Avenson </PERSON> said a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> organization has been built in regional areas of the state far earlier than in previous Democratic campaigns. Party chairman <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said there are 12 <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> field workers and six administrators in this important Midwestern farm state that has gone Republican in recent years. `` We're seeing organizational work developing very, very early in a campaign,'' <PERSON> Avenson </PERSON> said. `` Compared to recent years, it's unprecedented. In <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, a good state for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the campaign has opened 15 state offices, compared with one for Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, according to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign director <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Forciea </PERSON>. But in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, a difficult state for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, state campaign director <PERSON> Det </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON> said, `` We're operating almost totally on volunteers.'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Erie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Crangle </PERSON> acknowledged some `` sluggishness'' in the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign in recent weeks and said the problem has been discussed at local organizational meetings. He said some <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporters may have become overconfident in view of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s lead in the polls after the Democratic convention. That lead vanished in the glare of attention on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the GOP convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. The focus on the Republican ticket was prolonged after the convention because of the controversial selection of Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> as vice presidential nominee. In <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, a battleground state for the fall campaign, party executive director <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> said `` the <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> mess'' had drawn publicity to the Republican ticket _ and that it had hurt <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, even though much of the attention was critical. `` Right now, they've cut <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> off at the knees in terms of publicity,'' <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> said. `` I believe in my heart that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will eventually win <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, but I think we have to get back on track.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> himself voiced frustration on Monday that he has been unable to draw attention to his economic themes because of the attention on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attacks on him. `` The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign has lost some of its early momentum,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lodge </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. `` I think <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has controlled the debate, but he has done it through the traditional Republican trick of distorting Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s record.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sought to take the offensive Tuesday, aggressively attacking <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on crime, defense spending and his role in the Iran-Contra affair. `` I do n't think Democrats have been pushing forward as aggressively and quickly as the Republicans,'' said <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> Democrat. `` The Republicans have been forced to move quickly because they've had to stir the dust up so voters wo n't see where they're at in the road.'' Some state Democrats dismissed talk of the campaign stalling, or said it's so early it does n't matter. `` The campaign is won in the last two weeks, not the first two weeks,'' <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> party chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said.

 There are plenty of boos on the campaign trail with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, but they're not for the candidate They're for the press entourage traveling with him. The press is generally seen by pro-Quayle audiences as the skunk at the picnic as he makes his way around the country, because of reporters' questions about the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, his academic record, his resume and various other personal details <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has called `` side events.'' `` Let him alone!'' the audience shouts as reporters try to waylay the vice presidential nominee. Some of the shouts are less polite. Signs like `` Media Beware,'' `` Cut <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>'s Tongue Out'' and `` Press Go Home'' greet the traveling press. Last week, on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s seven-state trip, at almost every stop were identical signs with the word `` Press'' encircled in red and with a red slash mark through the word, leading some to suspect an organized effort. At a stop in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, one unidentified teen-ager held such a sign and told reporters, `` Someone gave it to me when I came in the door and I liked it.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s spokesman, said he had no idea where the signs came from. `` I'm quite confident that it is nobody affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> Bush-Quayle </ORGANIZATION> organization in any way, shape or form,'' he said. `` That's just not the way we do business.'' <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> does not intend to `` have a fight with the press.'' `` We're here to have a fight with the other guys on the issues,'' he said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was asked Sunday as he flew home whether he felt at times as if he were running against the news media, instead of the Democrats. `` I'm running with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' he replied. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> wo n't say whether he thinks the press is out to get him, telling reporters `` only you can answer that question.'' But he says he does not disagree with his wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, who last week said she felt the press was biased against <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> because he was a conservative. But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has made it clear he dislikes the intensive media scrutiny that has followed him since he became <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate and allegations surfaced that he pulled strings to get into the National Guard during the Vietnam War and into law school after an average performance in college. At the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> State Fair in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> petted a <LOCATION> Labrador </LOCATION> retriever guide dog and when the dog just lay there with his eyes rolled up, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` Now I know how it feels to be hounded.'' He tends to make sarcastic references to the press in his stump speech, often referring to `` my newfound friends in the news media'' or `` my cheering section.'' The references are not lost on the audiences. At one appearance in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, reporters who tried to ask <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> about the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> issue as he made his way shaking hands were dealt with roughly. A large woman hit one female reporter's arm and shoulder and turned and dealt another one a hefty body block. She said the two women were endangering a group of Scouts. `` I'm just trying to protect the children,'' she shouted. The hostility reached its peak at a rally in <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s hometown of <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, as he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaigned together on their first day after the Republican convention. At a news conference that was piped to the crowd over the public address system, the crowd cheered <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s answers and booed reporters' questions. `` B-o-r-i-n-g,'' they shouted. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> could n't resist another reference to the press, when he spoke to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION>. `` I feel that I am very accustomed to fighting fires these last couple of weeks.'' When he was presented with a fire chief's hat, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said: `` This is going to be prominently displayed on my airplane ... right in front of where the press is sitting.'' The hat will join another memento. At a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> stop last week, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s aides quickly grabbed up a bumper sticker which stated: `` I Do n't Love the Liberal Media.'' It is affixed it to the cabin door that faces the press section of the aircraft.

He said <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> had guaranteed a 10.0 rating. Last year's Emmys was the lowest-rated ever with an 8.8 its first of three years on <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>. When <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> carried the Emmys in 1986, it got a rating of 23.7 and a 36 share. Otherwise, it was a week of reruns with <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Cosby Show'' back in first place. The rest of the top 10 included <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` A Different World,'' `` Cheers'' and `` Night Court,'' CBS' `` 60 Minutes'' and `` Murder, She Wrote,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Police Academy 2,'' `` Golden Girls,'' `` Amen'' and `` <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>.'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won the week that ended Sunday with an average, prime-time rating of 12.2. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> had a 9.7 and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> had 8.9. But the three-network share of 56 percent was a rebound from the all-time low 47 during the week of the Republican National Convention. Each rating point represents the antion's 886,000 households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use. In the evening news race, `` ABC World News Tonight'' pulled into the lead with a 9.3 rating and 20 share. The `` CBS Evening News'' was second with a 9.0 and 20. `` NBC Nightly News'' remained in third with an 8.6 and 18 share.

 Despite strong objections from the prosecutor, a judge sentenced a cocaine dealer to stage benefit rock n' roll concerts for juvenile drug treatment programs rather than a prison term. The <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor who tried the case had asked the judge for a six-year sentence for 26-year-old <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> concert promoter. `` This is a better deal for society,'' said <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, whom a jury in April found guilty of offering cocaine for sale, possessing the drug for sale and being armed during the undercover narcotics transaction that incriminated him. Agents testified he carried a briefcase with 17 ounces of cocaine and a loaded handgun. The sentence was handed down last week by <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Teilh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> could avoid spending even a night in prison, but must donate 1,820 hours of community service work and pay a $ 5,000 fine. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, who has no previous record, also was sentenced to a year in the county jail, but would be allowed to work during the day and spend his evenings at home with an electronic monitor clamped to his ankle. `` I'm upset and very, very disappointed,'' said Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Dufreschou </PERSON>. `` We're trying to make a real deterrent against drug sales, and I do n't think this helps. `` Getting arrested and going to prison are part of the cost of doing business for drug dealers. What this does is lower their cost of doing business,'' she said. However, <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiraldi </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Institutions and Alternatives in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> called the judge's sentence `` courageous and wise.'' `` We're punishing the guy and getting a very needed community service at the same time.

 Residents who reported seeing a creature that resembled a crocodile were relieved to hear that police caught a 2-foot lizard, but now a larger animal is out and about. The unidentified owner retrieved the smaller lizard Sunday. But on Tuesday, he returned to police in this <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> community and admitted that another lizard, his `` golden tegu'' _ a 5-foot-long version _ has been on the loose for about a month. Acting Police Chief <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> said Tuesday that workers recently spotted the large lizard creeping near the town's garage, located near a marsh, where it is feeding on rodents. The owner is a student who police wo n't identify because he is being investigated by the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION>, Game & amp; Wildlife. But he has told police that the lizard is harmless unless provoked.

 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> left for <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> on Wednesday for his first talks with Polish authorities since Solidarity was banned. The government hoped the meeting would end two weeks of labor unrest. Asked what he would discuss with Interior Minister Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> during the talks, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said: `` How to make up for the past seven years.'' Solidarity was crushed in a 1981 military crackdown. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> traveled by car with senior Solidarity adviser <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>. The meeting <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s advisers said would be held Wednesday would follow four days of maneuvering started by <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>'s proposal on Friday that officials and worker representatives hold `` round-table'' discussions. A communique from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling Politburo, distributed by the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION>, mentioned a round-table meeting, endorsed it and said <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> should `` carry on with the mission entrusted to him.'' It was not clear, however, whether the reference was to the Wednesday meeting or the minister's original proposal on Friday. No other official reference was made to Walesa-Kiszczak talks. Ten enterprises in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> remained on strike. At its height, the current labor trouble involved 20 sites employing 100,000 people and was the worst since 1980. Solidarity spokesmen said there was no agreement for an immediate end to the strikes, in which a central demand has been making Solidarity legal again. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> called the decision for talks `` a historic moment.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> last met with the government on behalf of the union in late 1981. On Tuesday evening, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> left the strikebound <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> shipyard, where he works as an electrician, to confer with advisers and Bishop <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Goclowski </PERSON> at nearby <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brygida </LOCATION>'s church. He emerged from the rectory with the bishop later to cheers and chants from supporters. Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said earlier in the day that talks could begin as soon as <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> called off the strike at the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> shipyard, where the Soviet bloc's first free union was born in the labor uprising of 1980, but aide <PERSON> Piotr </PERSON> <PERSON> Konopka </PERSON> said: `` For the present, the strike is still on.'' He said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> would attend the Wednesday meeting as president of the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Self-Governing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION>, the labor federation's full name. While the government expressed its willingness to talk, strikers at the <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION> steel mill in southeastern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> said soldiers had moved into the town and helicopters flew over the plant. Workers are occupying the shipyard and steel mill, as is customary during strikes in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. In a reference to the <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION> strike, <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>'s ministry and the armed forces general staff issued a statement saying: `` In case of the continuation of the illegal strike action, appropriate lawful measures will be taken.'' <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON>, a historian and senior <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> adviser, said Tuesday night: `` The talks begin exactly on the anniversary of the August agreements'' that created Solidarity as a legal union in 1980. `` We want to believe that a new chance begins and it will be at a time when Poles can make use of this chance,'' he said. `` The results of this meeting tomorrow will be very important for the fate of the country and the world.'' <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> said: `` We hope that this meeting will serve the purpose of dialogue and agreement and the most important issue, which is trade union pluralism and the legalization of Solidarity.'' Urban told his weekly news conference Tuesday: `` The stoppage of strikes by Mr. <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and the shipyard where he works would mean automatically convening a round table.'' He said no rules had been made for the agenda of the `` round-table'' talks with representatives of various segments of society, to be moderated by <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, who suggested them last Friday. `` We are ready for talks ... with all those who respect the law, a significant symptom of which is avoiding participation in illegal srikes and moreover contributing to their stoppage,'' Urban said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> had said he would not call off the <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> shipyard strike unless Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s government promised to include trade union pluralism in the discussion and he was allowed to take part as the recognized leader of Solidarity. He traditionally marks the Aug. 31 date of the signing of the <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> agreements by laying a wreath at a monument to workers killed in labor unrest during 1970. It is near the Lenin shipyard's main gate <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON> said earlier that Urban's statement represented only a `` preliminary step'' because it `` does not say exactly what can be understood by the term round table, who would sit at it, and the subject of the talks.'' Most strikers have demanded higher pay and better working conditions in addition to legalization of Solidarity, but the status of the outlawed union is the only demand at <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Piotr </PERSON> <PERSON> Niemczyk </PERSON>, a Solidarity spokesman in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, said the workers had authoritized <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> to negotiate for them.

<HEAD>City Offers Rewards For Stinkers' Demise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANGUITCH, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Anxious to rid itself of the hordes of skunks roaming streets, yards, buildings and gardens, the city has put out a contract on the malodorous animals. Panguitch officials say the town's 1,400 residents have had it up to their noses, prompting authorities to offer a $ 5-a-skunk reward to encourage the trapping and destruction of the animals. `` It's a whole stinking problem,'' quipped City Manager <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Fullmer </PERSON>. `` This is a farming community, and the skunks come out of the fields and into the community once in a while.'' <PERSON> Fullmer </PERSON> said that in the past, this southwestern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> town contracted with resident <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> _ `` a pretty good man for handling skunks'' _ to get rid of the animals, but he died last year. The reward is aimed at enticing two animal control officers to take up the task, he said. Officials wo n't turn down residents who find a skunk or two under a shed or an old house. But officials are n't trying to encourage residents to go out and gather skins and then turn them in for the reward, <PERSON> Fullmer </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Seemingly unaffected, buffalo roam the parched <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> prairie on <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest bison ranch while crops wither and domestic livestock suffer and even die because of the drought. `` Nature sure gave them about everything it takes to survive ... except the bullet,'' said <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Houck </PERSON>, who with his late wife, <PERSON> Nellie </PERSON>, started the <ORGANIZATION> Houck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranch </ORGANIZATION> nearly three decades ago. The hardy bison, native to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, were hunted to near extinction in the late 1800s for its skins and meat. <PERSON> Houck </PERSON>'s buffalo forage on brown grass and linger near water holes. The ranch has more than 200 ponds, all of which have been drawn down by the drought, and some are almost dry. Depending on the season, 3,000 to 4,500 buffalo inhabit the 50,000-acre ranch that's fenced into 35 pastures. After the various herds are allowed to graze in one pasture for a few weeks, the gate to the next pasture is opened, and the huge beasts move into the area to resume foraging. `` The main breeding herd, we do n't feed them anything but grass,'' said the 83-year-old <PERSON> Houck </PERSON>. `` We try to supplement the calves a little the first year to give them a boost.'' Although the drought seems not to have affected the herd, its impact may show up next spring in a smaller calf crop, <PERSON> Houck </PERSON> said, explaining that this is the mating season. `` These cows wo n't conceive if they're not in good shape,'' <PERSON> Houck </PERSON> said, glancing over at the rummaging animals about 30 yards away. `` But so far these cows look pretty good. They're holding their meat pretty well.'' The ranch has n't had a decent rain in more than a year, and 100-plus-degree temperatures have been common all summer. But the drought of 1988 is no match yet for the Dust Bowl days of the 1930s, <PERSON> Houck </PERSON> said. `` The dry dust storms of the'30s still haunt me,'' he said. `` It was so dry in the spring of 1934 the grass never even sprouted.'' Not that <PERSON> Houck </PERSON> is n't concerned now. `` If we're forced into another year of drought, we'll probably have to graze our pastures a lot longer than we'd like to,'' he said. `` After going through those dry'30s, you wonder how long it's going to last. `` We've got to be pretty cautious because you ca n't just load buffalo on a truck and take them to the sale barn.'' Buffalo enjoy their freedom, and are handled as little as possible. `` When you get them in confinement, they've only got one thought in mind and that's to get away,'' <PERSON> Houck </PERSON> said. `` If you happen to be in the way, that's too bad.'' Horses once were used to round up the buffalo. Four-wheel drive trucks are now used. `` Buffaloes do n't seem to like horses'' and besides can outrun them, <PERSON> Houck </PERSON> said. One of his sons once `` got his horse knocked right out from under him'' by an angry buffalo. When buffaloes are 2 years old, they are sorted for bulls and heifers. Most bulls go to slaughter and heifers are kept for breeding. Between 800 and 1,000 are butchered on the ranch each year, <PERSON> Houck </PERSON> said. The market for buffalo meat, which is very low in fat, has been good, <PERSON> Houck </PERSON> said. `` Right now, we're getting $ 2 a pound for dressed buffalo meat.'' Once an endangered species, buffalo have made a remarkable comeback, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Buffalo numbers are estimated at between 75,000 and 100,000, she said. Their numbers reached into the millions before pioneers began forging westward and found them to be easy prey, dipping to a historical low near 1,000 head in 1889, <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON> said. Realizing the common misconception that buffalo still are endangered was a hindrance to marketing efforts, <PERSON> Houck </PERSON> helped form the Fort Pierre-based association, whose members now number about 1,200 buffalo producers. The Houcks began ranching by raising cattle. They switched to buffalo after a March 1966 blizzard that killed more than 200 of their cattle but not a single buffalo. `` They'll just stick their noses down into the snow and eat this grass, and they'll stay fat on it,'' <PERSON> Houck </PERSON> said. `` I wonder how they do it, but they do.''

<TEXT>
 When it comes to representing <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the banana slug just wo n't do, Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> said in vetoing a bill that designated the slimy, slothful creature the state's official mollusk. The veto by the image-conscious governor, announced Tuesday, squashed the hopes of a group of <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Birds </ORGANIZATION> and Camp Fire girls from the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area who led the campaign to make the banana slug a state mascot. `` I feel really bad that he vetoed it,'' says <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>, 9, whose Blue Bird troop worked six weeks lobbying. `` I mean, why did he have to do that? He did n't know anything about it. I hope he watched the news about it.'' <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> said he vetoed the bill because the large, brilliant yellow mollusk, which can eat poison oak without getting a rash, is n't a true Californian. `` If there is a need to designate a state mollusk, it would be more appropriate to select one that is indigenous to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and perhaps one that is more representative of the international reputation that <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> enjoys,'' he said in his veto message. The governor added that the dubious honor of being the banana slug's home state may belong to wetter neighbors to the north, since the species was first identified near the mouth of the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and lives as far north as <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. But members of the <ORGANIZATION> Redwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Birds </ORGANIZATION> and the office of the legislator who carried their slug bill said the governor is misinformed about the banana slug, which has the scientific name Ariolimax columbianus and lives in damp coastal forest areas throughout the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopcraft </PERSON>, an aide to Democratic Assemblyman <PERSON> Bryon </PERSON> <PERSON> Sher </PERSON>, said four of five kinds of banana slugs are native to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` I think basically the banana slug has gotten a bad rap,'' said <PERSON> Hopcraft </PERSON>, who wore a yellow armband Tuesday in memory of <PERSON> Sher </PERSON>'s bill `` They're obviously easy to look down upon and they do have some odd habits. Perhaps, the governor looked too much at that and not their good side. `` As far as its representative qualities, it's absolutely a unique example of the diversity of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s wildlife.'' <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, a Republican who's made a personal campaign of promoting <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> trade nationally and overseas, suggested the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> may not need an official slug at all. And if <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> must have a mollusk, he'd prefer the pismo clam, black abalone, red abalone, turban shell, two-spotted octupus, common squid or another breed of mussel unique to the state. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has several official mascots, including a tree, a fossil, a reptile, a fish, a rock and even a state insect in addition to the usual bird, animal and flower. The Legislature sent a bill to the governor Monday that would designate the square dance as the official folk dance, and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> swing, or jitterbug, as the official dance. <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> has not acted on that measure. The banana slug gained notoriety a few years ago when students at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> chose it as the official school mascot over the sea lion, despite the objections of the university's president.

<TEXT>
 To firefighters on the front lines, breathing the smoke is like going through four packs of cigarettes a day, but for those elsewhere in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, it poses little danger, doctors say. `` I think the main thing is it's much more an irritant,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Osman </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, who works at the Old Faithful medical clinic in the nation's oldest national park. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pardee </PERSON>, a retiree from <LOCATION> Casa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, who spends summers working in a general store at Old Faithful, can attest to the irritation. `` Whenever we get these inversions, we'd get all choked up,'' <PERSON> Pardee </PERSON> said Monday when he came to the clinic seeking relief. `` The last few days, it's been really bad. `` We like to walk back and forth to work,'' he continued. `` It's about three-quarters of a mile, but it's gotten so bad that by the time we got to work we could hardly talk to anybody. <PERSON> Pardee </PERSON>'s decision to turn to the clinic came on the second straight day of a weather inversion that trapped smoke from fires five miles away over the Old Faithful complex. At times during the two-day period the smoke was so heavy that nearby ridges were obscured. `` We tried bandanas and it worked better than nothing,'' he said. <PERSON> Tek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilgore </PERSON>, a nurse, offered him some surgical masks. `` This may just let us stay a little longer,'' <PERSON> Pardee </PERSON> said on the way back to work. Smoke conditions in the park were moderate to heavy throughout the day Tuesday. While in past days the smoke has hung over Old Faithful like a dense morning mist, <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kilgore </PERSON> have n't seen a rise in the number of patients. For one thing, said <PERSON> Kilgore </PERSON>, tourism has gone down as the fires have churned up, and those tourists who have serious respiratory conditions likely have stayed away. While there are no official figures for August, preliminary statistics show a 15 to 20 percent decline in tourism during the first two weeks of the month. The drop in patients has been noteable, <PERSON> Kilgore </PERSON> said. During normal summers, 25-30 people seek help at the clinic each day, compared with just two to five now, said <PERSON> Kilgore </PERSON>. Most who have come have had minor respiratory problems, said <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>. For those people away from the fire lines, the smoke's biggest harm is from irritating particulates, said <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>. `` It's not the same in terms of lung injuries,'' he said. `` It's probably no different than living in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> L.A </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s shutdown of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> labor federations with 80,000 workers and an association of 108 charities is disrupting institutions that Palestinians hope will form the basis of a future state. Palestinians charge that destroying grassroots organizations is the whole object of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s move, coming after the outlawing of the so-called popular committees that have guided the 8-month-old uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. `` They want them closed so when a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state comes, it will find no infrastructure,'' said <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Asali </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, one of seven professional groups shut by the Israelis. Israeli authorities accuse the organizations involved of being fronts for <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. They claim the groups distribute funds, recruit members or organize protests against Israeli rule. An army order closed the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> last Thursday, the professional groups a day later and the Palestinian charities association last Sunday. All were shut for one year. The professional organizations represent a total of 10,000 doctors, lawyers, dentists, pharmacists, veterinarians, engineers and agricultural specialists. The labor federation groups 55 unions with 70,000 members and covers almost the whole Palestinian work force. Col. <PERSON> Renaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON>, deputy Israeli army spokesman, said the two institutions and the charity association were ideal conduits for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> underground, providing offices, workers and communications links. `` In the past month, they became more and more active and were being used by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON> noted that the groups became more important when the government recently outlawed so-called popular committees, which had taken over local government functions such as street cleaning. The committees also organized demonstrations and enforced compliance with general strike calls. The army arrested more than 300 of the groups' leaders. <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> also was trying to tighten its grip on social groups that had been linked to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> until King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> announced July 31 that he was cutting adminstrative ties with the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ghassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayoub </PERSON>, a member of the labor federation's 13-member executive committee, denied the group was working for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, but acknowledged that some of its activities furthered the uprising. The federation negotiated agreements with Palestinian factories that guaranteed workers would be paid for days when they took part in general strikes, <PERSON> Ayoub </PERSON> said. He said the group also guaranteed full or partial pay for people unable to reach their work place because of curfews imposed by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ayoub </PERSON> said the agreements had nothing to do with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, but were protections that any union would seek for its members: `` We are unionists, not politicians.'' He said the federations' main task was to provide health insurance to members and assistance to families whose breadwinners lost their jobs or were injured in the unrest, which has claimed 255 Palestinian lives since it began Dec. 8. Four Israelis also have died. <PERSON> Raed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabra </PERSON>, another federation official, said the union group also makes monthly payments of about $ 120 to families of workers jailed by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative, said last week that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was reviewing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s special trade status after the <ORGANIZATION> American-Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Discrimination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> complained of indiscriminate closures of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> unions. But Israeli officials said the complaint did not recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security concerns, and <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON> said the government tried to be sensitive to the social functions of the institutions. `` We have to think twice, because -LRB- the groups -RRB- serve other functions such as improving social conditions and social welfare,'' he said. `` We do n't want to stop those activities, but when it involves the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> we have no choice.'' Both <PERSON> Ayoub </PERSON> and <PERSON> Asali </PERSON> of the lawyers' association said the closing down of their offices would not stop their work on behalf of laborers and professionals. <PERSON> Ayoub </PERSON> said offices of the federation's various unions remained open throughout the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. But the two said seizure of union documents from the offices would impede their organizations' work. <PERSON> Ayoub </PERSON> also said workers' committees were afraid to meet because of earlier arrests of labor leaders He also said he <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> might close union medical clinics. <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON> said no such action would be taken. The 42-year-old <PERSON> Ayoub </PERSON> was released three weeks ago after more than four months in jail. He was held under a law that does not require charges to be filed, but he said he was accused of being a member of <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, the mainstream <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction. He said neither he nor the federation was connected to <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, but added: `` We want our independent state and we feel it's our right to say so.''

 A <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight en route from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> made an emergency landing here Tuesday after fumes from a West German tourist's empty gasoline can filled the cabin, authorities said. <PERSON> Cal </PERSON> <PERSON> Clegg </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> special agent for <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, said the flight was diverted after the crew smelled the fumes. `` Without knowing the full details, they decided to divert the plane to <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Clegg </PERSON> said. He said a West German tourist, whose name and hometown were not available, was interviewed and authorities determined it was an innocent mistake. `` In a nutshell, one of the passengers, a West German who had been touring the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, had taken on board with him what was an apparently empty gas can that still had vapors in it,'' <PERSON> Clegg </PERSON> said. `` During compression and decompression, the vapors emitted into the cabin area.'' <PERSON> Clegg </PERSON> said the tourist, who was traveling alone, had rented a car earlier and ran out of gas. `` He had purchased this can and then decided to take it home to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> with him because he had paid for it and apparently they do n't have metal gasoline cans in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, just plastic,'' <PERSON> Clegg </PERSON> said. He said he was unsure how the man got past security guards before boarding the plane.

 A Chinese jetliner landing in pouring rain skidded into the sea off the runway at <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s airport Wednesday and broke in half, killing six of the 89 people on board, the government said. Flight 301 from <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> province about 90 miles northwest of this British colony, crashed at 9:19 a.m. -LRB- 9:19 p.m. EDT -RRB-, government-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong </ORGANIZATION> reported. Five of the dead were among the 11-member Chinese crew, according to a statement released by the airline. The nationality of the single dead passenger was not immediately known. The radio reported that at least three of the dead were recovered from the wreckage of the plane, which was partially submerged. Thirteen people were injured. Hundreds of divers, aided by helicopters and boats, scoured the water in search of survivors. Small rubber rafts with rescue personnel bobbed around the wreckage of the British Aerospace Trident jet as fire engines crowded onto <ORGANIZATION> Kai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>'s only runway, which juts into <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. ` It fell into the sea at the end of the runway,'' police spokesman <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Leung </PERSON> said of the jetliner of the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s flag carrier. The Government Information Services said 83 people were rescued and 13 were hospitalized. It said the plane carried 78 passengers and 11 crew members. Government spokesmen at the scene said six people were confirmed dead. The radio interviewed an unidentified passenger who claimed that some of the plane's safety belts did not work. `` That's why when the plane landed so hard, people simply were flying,'' the woman passenger told the station. Japanese media in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> reported the flight manifest indicated 12 Japanese were on the plane. An official at <ORGANIZATION> Queen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elizabeth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> said one of the injured was from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The government said the rest of the injured were Chinese. The radio reported that helicopters ferried some of the rescued passengers to military hospitals and that an emergency treatment center was set up at the airport. All incoming and outgoing flights were canceled, the radio said. There was no immediate indication of what caused the accident. The worst accident at <PERSON> Kai </PERSON> <PERSON> Tak </PERSON> occurred in 1967, when a Thai International flight crashed into the harbor killing 24 of 73 people on board. Two cargo planes have crashed on take-off from <PERSON> Kai </PERSON> <PERSON> Tak </PERSON> since then, but no one was killed in those accidents.

<TEXT>
 There's probably no way for national TV talk shows to completely safeguard themselves against determined hoaxers, say the producers of three shows that featured `` guests'' who turned out to be phonies. Two part-time actors said Tuesday they posed as people with sexual problems to get on national television, putting one over on <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Jessy </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tani </PERSON> <PERSON> Freiwald </PERSON>, 37, and <PERSON> Wes </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, 33, both of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, appeared Tuesday on yet another talk show, `` CBS This Morning.'' `` After you go through the first one, they get really easy,'' Ms. <PERSON> Freiwald </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Freiwald </PERSON> said she first appeared in November on `` The <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON> Show'' in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, posing as a woman who had been married 14 years and hated sex. `` I do n't see anyway we could have double checked this guest's -LRB- Ms. <PERSON> Freiwald </PERSON>'s -RRB- story based on the fact that she was presented to us on a doctor's referral,'' said <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> DiMaio </PERSON>, <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON>'s executive producer `` I consider it to be an isolated incident _ I do n't think there are a lot of people who want to come on national television and create a personal problem that's probably considered embarrassing by the general public.'' <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Freiwald </PERSON> said they were asked to appear on the talk shows by a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> psychologist-author, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dauw </PERSON>, for whom Ms. <PERSON> Freiwald </PERSON> was working as an office manager. `` He asked me to do it because the surrogates he does have working for him are neither presentable or articulate enough'' to go on television, Ms. <PERSON> Freiwald </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dauw </PERSON> did not return calls to his home or office, but he was quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> Omaha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World-Herald </ORGANIZATION> as saying that Ms. <PERSON> Freiwald </PERSON> worked as an office manager and a sex surrogate, a stand-in sexual partner employed by a therapist, and <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> was a client and that they were not acting. In May, Ms. <PERSON> Freiwald </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> appeared on `` The <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Jessy </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> <PERSON> Show </PERSON>,'' which originates from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, with <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> posing as an impotent husband and Ms. <PERSON> Freiwald </PERSON> as his sex surrogate. In July, they appeared on `` <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> playing a 35-year-old virgin and Ms. <PERSON> Freiwald </PERSON>, a sex surrogate. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said the only time he was worried during the talk-show stints was when <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> assured the studio audience that the two were not actors reproducing a scene. `` There was a little clenching in the stomachs ... but we've both been performers all our adult lives,'' <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubrow </PERSON>, <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON>'s executive producer, said the show was simply duped, despite its safeguards. `` How do you know you're really talking to <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubrow </PERSON>?'' he asked during a telephone interview. `` You do n't. We have basically the same procedures as you do. We go to people who are credible and legitimate. In this particular case we went to a doctor who wrote seven books, we asked him if he knew of a sex surrogate, and he found someone who worked for him. ... He's claiming as early as this morning to me that she is a sex surrogate, so we do n't know exactly where we stand.'' <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> reacted angrily Monday when he learned the real identities of his `` guests.'' `` These people are admitting now to having committed fraud or at least misrepresentation ... and we're going to go after them,'' <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> said. `` This is something that goes right to the integrity of the broadcast itself. I'm really spitting mad.'' <PERSON> Delia </PERSON> <PERSON> Fine </PERSON>, his senior producer, said guests are often found with the help of experts and organizations and then put through a rigorous pre-interview process. `` If someone really has the intention to put one over on you, I'm not sure what all the safeguards are to protect yourself,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Fine </PERSON> said guests sign a release `` that says basically they're going to be telling the truth.'' `` We absolutely try and do everything we can do, but if someone is determined to do it there always are ways to get through,'' said <PERSON> Lorri </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, senior producer of `` Donahue,'' which was not a victim this time. `` Thank God we were n't involved in this one, but it does, I think, hurt everybody's credibility.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> WINSTON-SALEM </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Anti-smoking activists are urging the federal government to regulate a high-tech, low-smoke cigarette developed by <ORGANIZATION> R.J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> that hits three cities for test-marketing soon. `` I'm not at all surprised that they announced the test-marketing,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Banzhaf </PERSON>, executive director of Action on <ORGANIZATION> Smoking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` They wanted to get a jump on it. After all, it's a lot more difficult to get the genie back in the bottle after the fact.'' <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday that the new cigarette, which simulates smoking by heating a flavor capsule instead of burning tobacco, will be test-marketed in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, starting Oct. 1. Reynolds, one of the nation's largest cigarette manufacturers and a subsidiary of Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, began selling the new brand, Premier, this week to distributors, supermarkets and discount chains in the cities. While it will cost about 25 percent more _ or about 30 cents a pack _ than the company's other brands, <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> believes it could become its best-selling brand. The company will use a variety of messages, including one that touts the cigarette as `` Premier _ the Cleaner Smoke.'' <PERSON> Banzhaf </PERSON> said about two dozen anti-smoking groups met with <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials recently to urge the agency to regulate the cigarette. <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, branch director of the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, said that if the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> does n't get involved, smokers wo n't know what they're inhaling `` My theory is that regardless of what -LRB- company officials -RRB- are saying, if they're going to light it, they're still going to have carbon monoxide, which is one of the major irritants in smoke, and nicotine,'' she said. `` They're not telling us what's in that packet. They do n't want the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> to be involved, because then they would have to tell everybody what they put into tobacco smoke.'' Company officials, however, are not making any health claims, which could invite scrutiny by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>. `` If a product is sold with claims to make cigarettes safer, it is a medical device'' and subject to <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigg </PERSON>, an agency spokesman. `` This is not a safe or safer cigarette,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kampe </PERSON>, president of <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>' development divison. `` It's a cleaner cigarette.'' He said the term `` smokeless cigarette'' used by the media to describe the product is a misnomer. The cigarette contains a packet of tobacco extracts that is heated, not burned, through a `` carbon heat source'' lit at the tip. The result is a cigarette without odor and only a trace of ash or smoke that could irritate people nearby, <PERSON> Kampe </PERSON> said. `` It reduces many of the controversial compounds associated with burning cigarettes and virtually eliminates sidestream smoke,'' he said.

<HEAD>Officer Recounts Dramatic Submarine Rescue</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Peruvian sailors broke the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>'s surface `` gasping and screaming from pain'' after a rapid 110-foot ascent from their sunken submarine, which was running out of fresh air, a navy officer said. The Peruvian navy said Tuesday that one of the sailors died of the bends on Monday but that the others were recovering. The navy originally said 21 sailors were saved Saturday with a U.S.-supplied diving bell that brought them slowly to the surface. But the officer, who participated in the rescue operation, said Tuesday that the diving bell did not arrive in time for the trapped crewmen, who `` would surely have died'' if they did not use a dangerous escape chamber similar to a torpedo tube. The officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that after their escape the men, suffering from severe cases of the bends, were rushed in speedboats to decompression chambers on shore. Four other sailors were killed shortly after the Japanese fishing boat <ORGANIZATION> Kyowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maru </ORGANIZATION> rammed the submarine Pacocha on Friday three miles off the <LOCATION> Callao </LOCATION> harbor, causing the vessel to sink in 15 minutes. The navy said 45 sailors of the 52 sailors aboard either were rescued or survived by jumping into the water as the submarine went down. Three sailors are still missing and presumed dead. The submarine's commander <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nieve </PERSON> and three crewmen were killed shortly after the crash. The navy said <PERSON> Nieve </PERSON> led the evacuation but died sealing a hatch to protect the men inside. The navy officer who spoke with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> gave this account: Rescuers reached the site at 8 p.m. and divers swam to the crippled Pacocha shortly after midnight. The vessel was half full of water and divers did not think anyone was alive. Divers tapped in code on the crippled submarine's hull, which drew a response and the trapped crewmen began communicating with divers via a message hatch on the craft's side. `` They said they had food and air and everyone was calm,'' the officer said. At 8 a.m. Saturday navy officials decided to await help from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and a specially-designed diving bell was due late Saturday night. But air supplies dwindled faster than expected and toxic gas from the vessel's flooded batteries began seeping into the dry compartment where the sailors had sealed themselves. Attempts to inject air from another submarine failed. At 9:30 a.m. the trapped crewmen sent a message saying they needed air and were going to attempt to escape the vessel using an emergency pressure chamber, a life-threatening maneuver even if successful. Four men at a time, wearing life preservers and masks, crammed into a tiny chamber similar to a torpedo tube, sealed themselves from the craft, allowed in water to equalize pressure with the ocean, and opened a hatch. An instant earlier, they emptied their lungs of air because a rapid release of pressure at the surface could explode their lungs. Divers waited outside the sub and aimed the crewmen toward the surface. The sailors shot more than 100 feet in 30 seconds, pushed up by their life preservers. `` They came up gasping and screaming from pain,'' due to the tremendous pressure change, the officer said. The first group, which escaped at about 10:30 a.m., was followed by groups every hour or two. The final three hit the surface at 6:15 p.m., more than 22 hours after the submarine sank. One of the 21 crewmen died Monday from a cerebral embulism caused by his ascent from the ocean floor, but officials said the others appeared out of danger. The bends, or decompression sickness, is caused by the formation of nitrogen bubbles in the blood or body tissues as the result of a sudden lowering of atmospheric pressure. It is characterized by tightness in the chest, by pains in the joints, and by convulsions and collapse in severe cases.

 Drawn by adventure and hopes of big profits, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s 238 newly licensed alligator hunters are getting ready to begin the state's first legal gator hunt in 26 years.

Wide-eyed amateurs will be stalking freshwater swamps, lakes and streams with hopes of cashing in on their catch, which can bring as much as $ 1,000 for a 10-foot gator's skin and meat. But some experts are wondering if the permit holders really know what they're in for. `` You got to laugh when you hear these people say they're going to make money off this hunt,'' said 37-year-old <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON>, who operates one of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s few alligator processing plants. `` They do n't figure in the time, expenses _ and do n't forget the danger,'' <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` I'd like to see some people's faces the first time a gator takes a bite at their airboat For 30 days beginning at sunset Thursday, the randomly selected permit holders will be allowed to hunt in designated areas where the gator population is extraordinarily high. Waterfront residents all over <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> called for a hunt against the carnivorous reptiles after a 10 -LCB- - foot bull gator killed 4-year-old <PERSON> Erin </PERSON> <PERSON> Glover </PERSON> in the Gulf Coast community of <LOCATION> Englewood </LOCATION> in June But game officials have placed tight restrictions on the hunt. Permit holders will be working at night, when flashlights make the reptiles' eyes glow eerily red. And they are not allowed to use guns, relying on clubs, traps and hooks attached to poles. The harvest is limited to up to 3,435 gators, with each hunter limited to 15 gators each. `` We expect to be up non-stop from Thursday until about Monday, either skinning or hunting,'' <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON> said at his 2-year-old processing operation in this remote southwest <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> town. `` We're gon na be looking at a lot of dead gators. Skinning an average alligator is a full day's work, <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON> reckons. First he plunges his hunting knife through the gator's thick hide at the tip of its tail. Then, it's a slow and difficult cut to the snout. `` You got to look at it as an hour a foot to properly skin and gut a gator,'' said <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON>. `` There's no way around it. It's hard work, you bet.'' Some of the experienced hunters will be permitted to use the equipment at the gator house, a cement frame enclosed by screen wire and decorated by deer antlers. But the novice trappers will have to sit and watch their catch be pried apart. Alligators are cut up the back to preserve the valuable hide covering the belly and underarms, said <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON>. The hide, which sells for about $ 42 a foot to foreign manufacturers, is submerged in a brine solution for about a week. The excess flesh is then scraped off and the skin is sun dried. `` And we bury the innards as far away as possible,'' said <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON>. `` They got a powerful smell and if you ever cut open the stomach you better start running.'' The meat, which <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON> says makes a nice addition to spaghetti sauce, must be frozen within hours after the alligator is killed. One 12-foot gator bought to the plant in 1986 yielded 230 pounds of meat. `` You're fixing to eat gator for a long time with a catch like that,'' said <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON>'s 24-year-old brother, <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>. Yet the gator business is just a hobby for the Dunaways and their uncle <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Busby </PERSON>, 36. All will take vacation time from their jobs to process the gators. They say the best they can do charging a $ 30 fee and $ 2 a pound is break even. `` We just like it out here with the gators,'' said <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Two Soviets and the first Afghan in space docked their Soyuz-TM 6 capsule with the Mir orbiting space station today, joining two Soviet cosmonauts who have been in space more than eight months, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. The state-run news agency said the capsule linked up with the space station at 9:41 a.m. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> time -LRB- 1:41 a.m. EDT -RRB-. `` The cosmonauts feel well,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said in a brief dispatch. The capsule, launched two days ago from the <ORGANIZATION> Baikonur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, carried a veteran cosmonaut, a doctor and an Afghan air force pilot. Soviet television showed a live transmission of the crew entering the space station and meeting with the cosmonauts already on board. Afghan cosmonaut <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohmand </PERSON> was shown reading portions of the Koran, the Moslem holy book. The cosmonauts who have been aboard Mir for eight months have been reported in good health, but Dr. <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Polyakov </PERSON> will stay on to monitor their health as they try to set an endurance record. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> did not say how long <LOCATION> Mohmand </LOCATION> and the third new arrival, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyakhov </PERSON>, would remain aboard the station with its crew. <PERSON> Polyakov </PERSON>, an expert on space endurance, is to monitor the health of <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Titov </PERSON>, 40, and <PERSON> Musa </PERSON> <PERSON> Manarov </PERSON>, 37, who have been in space since Dec., 21 and are hoping to break a 326-day endurance record set by <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Romanenko </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Polyakov </PERSON> had bone marrow removed before the flight. When he returns to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, more marrow is to be removed and the samples compared. Scientists are trying to determine how to counter bone marrow depletion, which results from prolonged space flight. <PERSON> Polyakov </PERSON> also will study motion sickness. Space officials say the endurance tests are a step toward determining whether a manned flight to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>, which they estimate would take three years, is feasible. <LOCATION> Mohmand </LOCATION>, 29, is to take part in experiments to identify oil, gas and other mineral deposits in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and to predict runoff of snow and ice in efforts to alleviate water shortages. His presence represents efforts by the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> to boost the prestige of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s pro-Soviet government as Soviet troops withdraw. The Soviets have agreed to withdraw all their troops by Feb. 15. Half of the 100,000 soldiers have left <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> since withdrawal began in May. The flight is the 47-year-old <PERSON> Lyakhov </PERSON>'s third space mission. He was in space for 175 days in 1979 and took part in a 150-day mission in 1983.

<HEAD>Harvard In Pact With TV Networks, Writers To Fight Drunken Driving</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime time TV characters this fall will begin turning down drinks in a coordinated assault on drunken driving initiated by <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> health researchers. Make-believe wives will designate make-believe husbands as non-drinking drivers. Teen-agers who drink will take taxis. And for the next few years polltakers will be trying to find out if viewers are coming under the influence of the push for a `` designated driver.'' `` The goal of the project is to achieve a fundamental change in American social norms regarding drinking and driving,'' <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Winsten </PERSON>, assistant dean of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> and director of its <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday night. `` In attempting to achieve that change, we're asking the entertainment, communication and advertising industries to work with us to add momentum behind changes that are already beginning to occur in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said of the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Winsten </PERSON> said the commitment was made by 13 television studios in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> that are responsible for more than 70 percent of prime time weekly programming on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. The executives pledged to ask their writers and producers to introduce in their scripts the notion that drinking and driving is taboo, through devices as simple as having drinkers take taxis or saying, `` No thanks, I'm driving.'' <PERSON> Winsten </PERSON> said if the television campaign succeeds, others will be tried. But drunken driving was the priority, he said, reciting these statistics: drunken driving kills 24,000 people each year; studies show as few as two drinks can make a fatal accident twice as likely; two of five Americans will be victims of a drunken driver. In January, <PERSON> Winsten </PERSON> began meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> executives to forge the agreements. In April, he won a unanimous endorsement from the board of the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America-West </ORGANIZATION>, whose members write for prime time TV. The networks also agreed to run public service announcements in December to encourage the `` designated driver'' idea, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> advertising firm, <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> DFS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Compton </ORGANIZATION>, has provided advertising research on the designated driver idea, and the <ORGANIZATION> Gallup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> said it will donate its services to poll the public to find out whether the TV campaign is working, the newspaper said. Gallup research shows that 78 percent of all drivers would be willing to serve occasionally as designated drivers. <PERSON> Winsten </PERSON> said the campaign will continue for at least three to five years before its real impact will be known. The campaign has precedents, he said. Television networks during the past year or two have been using their characters to encourage the use of seatbelts and to try to take the glamour out of alcohol. But <PERSON> Winsten </PERSON> said he believed this was the first such effort mobilized by a school of public health.

 Four councilmen refused a third time to change their votes against a housing desegregation plan, as requests from them and the city to continue a stay of contempt fines went to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Unless the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> takes their side, the defiant councilmen will be hit with criminal charges, the state agency that has taken over <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>' finances warned Tuesday. ` It's the city councilmen who are defying the law and putting the city's financial profile at risk, who are putting all the citizens of <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> at risk,'' said <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON>, head of the state's <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. The $ 500-a-day fines against the councilmen, along with potentially devastating fines against the city that could reach $ 1 million a day, were imposed by federal Judge <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sand </PERSON>. He found them in contempt Aug. 2, the day after the council's first 4-3 rejection of the court-ordered plan. On Friday, a federal appeals panel upheld the contempt finding but gave <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> a week to take the case to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> before reinstating the penalties. Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> on Tuesday referred the four applications from the councilmen and one from the city to the full <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, according to a court spokesman who gave no indication when the court might rule on a stay. Only after a stay is granted would the court consider the appeal of Sand's contempt finding. At the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s regular meeting Tuesday night, Councilmen <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Spallone </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Longo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Chema </PERSON> again rejected a zoning amendment needed to carry out a housing plan that the council had accepted last January. The Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, during a visit to <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>, said the city must `` end its illegal resistance'' to the plan. He added that he would be willing to meet with the four but would not specify when that would happen. Three of the four said they would be happy to meet with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, while <PERSON> Spallone </PERSON> said, `` Have him call me.'' Sand ordered the plan to remedy what he determined in a 1985 ruling to have been 40 years of deliberate segregation in housing and education in the city. The plan calls for 200 low-income public housing units to be built in the predominantly white east side of <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>, with 800 moderate-income apartments to be built throughout the city. Unless a stay is granted, the fines, currently suspended, will be reimposed Friday. The councilmen have paid $ 3,500 each. The city has paid $ 12,700. Its daily payment would resume at $ 12,800 and double daily until it reaches $ 1 million a day, when it will be capped. That would give the city an estimated 70 days until bankruptcy. <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON> said that if the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appeal is turned down, she will notify District Attorney <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Vergari </PERSON> that the councilmen are breaking state law by endangering the city's fiscal stability. The four already face possible imprisonment as early as Sunday for contempt. `` I feel it is unfortunate that people elected to uphold the law and defend the law are breaking and defying the law,'' <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON> said. Her remarks came a day after Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said he would initiate removal proceedings and urge the councilmen's jailing if the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused the stay.

 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> firefighters battled more than 170 fires, while gusts in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> threatened to fan a 90,000-acre blaze toward 600 cabins and the park superintendent said there was no end in sight to this summer's wildfires. <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> ranchers prepared for possible evacuation today, and crews fought woodland blazes in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, nearly 9,500 lightning strikes Tuesday sparked scores of blazes a year after a similar barrage spawned devastating fires. Firefighters said more than 4,600 acres had burned, but they held most of the blazes to an acre or less in the drought-parched wildlands. Crews were hampered by 100-plus-degree temperatures, winds and lightning in some areas. The unfavorable conditions were expected to continue today. Altogether on state land, 73 lightning-sparked fires burned 2,700 acres, said state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrill </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathes </PERSON> said 43 lightning-caused fires in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> national forests burned just 30 acres, while 60 blazes in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> national forests blackened 1,900 acres. `` We are flying over the areas to determine if there are any -LRB- other -RRB- hot spots,'' <PERSON> Terrill </PERSON> said. Near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, fire swept through dry brush and trees Tuesday in <LOCATION> Orinda </LOCATION>, destroying five houses and badly damaging two others. Police believe an electronically ignited toy rocket may have sparked the blaze, which was controlled in about two hours without reports of injuries. `` This has been the worst time of my life,'' said <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopp </PERSON>, whose 33-year-old home was destroyed. `` What do you do after all these years?'' The only thing she and her husband, <PERSON> Al </PERSON>, could save was a desk containing money and insurance papers. In <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, flames from the 90,000-acre North Fork fire at <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> moved to within a quarter-mile Tuesday of the Canyon hotel and campground complex. A military helicopter dropped foam on the visitors center and other buildings in the complex, which includes hundreds of wooden cabins. Park officials closed the area last week when flames moved to within a half mile. Firefighters hoped for an early winter to quell blazes burning about a fifth of the 2.2 million-acre park, but <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s superintendent offered little encouragement `` When will this end? Frankly, ladies and gentlemen, that's anybody's guess,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON> told about 100 people Tuesday night at a meeting in nearby <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mont </LOCATION> Gusty winds forecast for this afternoon threatened to again close some park roads that were put off limits Tuesday afternoon but later reopened. The wind ended several days of calm weather. <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said activity on the 34,000-acre <LOCATION> Wolf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> fire forced closure of one road, and a flareup in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fork </LOCATION> blaze closed <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s west entrance for several hours. The entrance was later reopened, but <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said it could be closed again today depending on the fire's activity. To the north in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, winds played havoc with efforts to control the 190,000-acre Clover-Mist fire, burning in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> and in neighboring <ORGANIZATION> Shoshone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. Officials closed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 212 near <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for a time Tuesday as soldiers chased spot fires. Ranchers were planning for possible evacuation today along western <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> where a previously `` let-it-burn'' wilderness fire jumped onto national forest and private land Tuesday. Hundreds of firefighters rushed to keep it from spreading further. The 39,000-acre blaze in the Scapegoat Wilderness roared into <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, burning 7,000 additional acres. Livestock and horses were removed from cabins threatened by the 9-week-old blaze, which was sparked by lightning, and some ranchers left as a precaution. Authorities did not know how many people lived in the sparsely populated area. In <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, crews near the <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> line worked to protect ranches in the <ORGANIZATION> Caribou </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> after a 6,000-acre fire burned to within a mile of the properties Tuesday. One family was evacuated because they lack a telephone and could n't be notified in case the blaze blew up. Seventeen major fires are burning 70,000 acres in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. The number of firefighters more than doubled Tuesday to 679 at <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s biggest forest fire, which has burned 36,000 acres in the <ORGANIZATION> Wallowa-Whitman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> and the Hell's <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION>. Favorable weather in eastern <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> helped thousands of firefighters gain a handle on fires burning on more than 23,000 acres.

<HEAD>WYOMING:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Eight forest fires are burning in <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> and four in the surrounding national forests in northwestern <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. Flames from the 90,000-acre North Fork fire at <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> moved to within a quarter-mile Tuesday of the Canyon hotel and campground complex. A military helicopter dropped foam on the Canyon visitors center and other buildings. The fires have charred about 450,000 acres of the 2.2 million-acre park. Officials said they have spent $ 54.4 million fighting them and about 8,400 firefighters, including hundreds of soldiers, are at work. The largest fire outside <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Mink </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> fire, covers 108,000 acres of the <ORGANIZATION> Bridger-Teton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>.

 Eight major fires had burned about 188,000 acres of <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> forests by Tuesday. Four were in designated wilderness areas, including one that has spread into Yellowstone National Park. Ranchers near the growing, 46,000-acre Scapegoat Wilderness blaze, the state's largest, were warned they may have to evacuate today.

<HEAD>IDAHO:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 More than 2,500 firefighters and dozens of National Guardsmen were fighting 17 major fires over 70,000 acres. Crews were expected to use bulldozers to dig fire lines today around ranches in the <ORGANIZATION> Caribou </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> threatened by the 7,000-acre <LOCATION> Trail </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> blaze.

<HEAD>OREGON:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Forces battling <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s biggest forest fire, the 35,700-acre lightning-sparked Tepee Butte blaze in the state's northeastern corner, were more than doubled Tuesday to 679 people. In the state's eastern high desert, firefighters expected to contain today the <LOCATION> Shirttail </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> fire, 30 miles southeast of <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. The fire broke out Monday in an industrial area and burned 5,000 acres of rangeland. More than 52,000 acres have burned since lighting storms touched off fires last week.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CALIFORNIA:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Nearly 9,500 lightning strikes Monday and early Tuesday ignited more than 170 brush and timber blazes in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a year after a similar storm spawned devastating fires. Although most of the fires were kept to an acre or less, firefighters said hot, windy weather in the drought-parched forests hindered their work. In the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area, fire swept through dry brush and trees Tuesday in <LOCATION> Orinda </LOCATION>, destroying five houses and badly damaging two others. Police believe an electronically ignited toy rocket may have sparked the blaze.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WASHINGTON:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Favorable weather helped thousands of firefighters gain a handle on major fires burning on more than 23,000 acres of trees and brush in eastern <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. Winds were light Tuesday as crews cut trails around nearly 70 percent of separate major fires on the Colville Indian Reservation and the <ORGANIZATION> Colville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. The state's largest fire was on the Indian reservation, where 9,250 acres of timber and brush burned.

<TEXT>
 One of two ex-bank officers sentenced to prison for crimes that contributed to the near-collapse of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> held his head and wept as he apologized for the people he had hurt. Sentenced Tuesday were <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> vice president, and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, the head of energy lending at the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Square </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>, 53, and <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, 38, pleaded guilty June 30 to one criminal charge each for a scheme in which <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> allegedly took kickbacks in exchange for arranging to have <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> buy millions of dollars in risky energy loans from <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. Penn Square failed in 1982, and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> nearly collapsed two years later after an unprecedented run on its deposits. Continental was kept afloat by a $ 4.5 billion government bailout. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Shadur </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> to 3 -LCB- years in prison, despite <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>'s pleas for probation. <PERSON> Shadur </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> to a 2-year term. The maximum sentence allowed under their plea bargain was five years. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, who held his head and choked back tears as he spoke in his own defense, said he was sorry for his actions and was concerned about his family. He had sought a sentence of probation and community service. `` I'm sorry for the people in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` I think of that a lot.'' <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Burck </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, said after the sentencing, `` We're relieved to have it behind us.'' <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>, testifying before his sentencing, said he accepted responsibility for his actions. He asked the judge to sentence him to no more than six months in prison and assign him to work with the poor on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>. But the judge said <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> seemed, at times, `` unwilling to confront the realities'' of what he had done. `` You allowed your conduct as a bank officer ... to be driven impermissibly by your desire for personal benefits,'' <PERSON> Shadur </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> pleaded guilty to misapplication of bank funds, while <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> pleaded guilty to a charge that he aided and abetted <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>. The pleas came two months after a trial of the two ended with a deadlocked jury. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> had manipulated <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> and a third man, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> drilling contractor <PERSON> Jere </PERSON> <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON>, in schemes to save his own failing bank. <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON> was acquitted of wire fraud charges. Defense attorneys contended that <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> was saddled with the troublesome energy loans because of an aggressive lending policy.

<TEXT>
 Sister <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, the principal of <ORGANIZATION> Josephinum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, once thought she'd have to hold a memorial service, not a birthday party, when the all-girls school turns 100 in two years. The school on the city's rough <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> was set to close as recently as 1985, but the Sisters of <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charity </ORGANIZATION> underestimated the will of alumni, parents and corporations who opened their wallets to help keep the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> school alive. Today, the donations are increasing and enrollment has soared 50 percent. For now, Sister <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> says, the school is in good condition, no longer on the critical list. `` We're growing,'' says Assistant Principal <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Rescigno </PERSON>, who often makes a recruiting pitch from church pulpits in the mostly Hispanic neighborhood. `` When parents come in with their kids they say they ca n't tolerate the public schools.'' The longstanding troubles in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s public school system have indeed helped <PERSON> Josephinum </PERSON>, where only about half of the 310 students are <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. Frustrated by teacher strikes and violence, and concerned about the quality of a system labeled one of the nation's worst by outgoing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, many parents are sending children elsewhere. `` That's a repeated story,'' Sister <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> said. `` We had 48 students who transferred here last year. They've been to public school. They did n't do well. They're intimidated.'' At Josephinum, there's no graffiti on the walls and the floors shine like the chrome on a well-polished Chevy. `` Register at the Jo,'' a sign reads in the lobby. Students say they're glad they did. <PERSON> Evette </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, an 18-year-old senior, failed her freshman year at a public school, so she enrolled at Josephinum and started from scratch. `` Since I've been here, my grades are up,'' Miss <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said Tuesday, the second day of the new academic year. `` Although it's all girls, it's fun Teachers in public schools do n't care; they just get paid.'' Sophomore <PERSON> Patrina </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, 15, said, `` It's not too large. The teachers are all concerned. Everyone has friends.'' A glance at the composite photos of Josephinum graduates provides proof of the neighborhood's changing face. In the mid-1960s, when enrollment reached an all-time high of 850, the school was filled mostly with the daughters of Polish, German and <LOCATION> Ukrainian </LOCATION> immigrants. Today, those ethnic Eastern Europeans have been replaced by a student body that is 50 percent black and 37 percent Hispanic, many of them from families with low incomes and little education. About half of this year's students have grants ranging from $ 100 to $ 500 to help cover the annual tuition of $ 1,295. Sister <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> calls them `` work-study scholarships.'' `` They just do n't get money handed to them,'' she said. `` They're assigned to a teacher. They might clean a room, might run off papers, staple things together.'' The tough neighborhood, <PERSON> Rescigno </PERSON> says, gives the school the quality of an oasis. `` Many come from very poor backgrounds, problems that we ca n't even imagine,'' he said `` We're like a haven seven or eight hours a day, especially if your father's a pusher or your mother walks the street.'' To keep financially afloat, the school now has a development director. During the 1986-87 academic year, 670 donors gave $ 96,000. A year later, the amount grew to $ 169,000. <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> gave $ 10,000 to help Josephinum produce a music video that <PERSON> Rescigno </PERSON> will use during his recruiting stops at area elementary schools _ trips that some day might boost enrollment to 400 students.

<HEAD>Dollar Higher In Modest Trading, Gold Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar rose in European trading this morning after senior Japanese officials said their country is leaving its base rate unchanged in keeping with international policy commitments. Gold prices fell because of the stronger dollar, dealers said. Foreign exchange dealers predicted a relatively quiet session as the market waits for Friday's release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment figures. Traders in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> said they expected the dollar to register further gains against the Japanese yen because of the decision not to raise interest rates. `` It's logical that if interest rates rise in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and most of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and not in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, then the yen has to suffer. The only surprise is that the effect was delayed,'' said a trader with an Italian commercial bank in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>. The trader cautioned, however, that the dollar's rise against the yen could be blocked by profit-taking or fears of intervention by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>.

 <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> declared that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is not over and accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> of plotting against the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, meanwhile, accused <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of seeking to wreck peace talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> by raising `` unnecessary or out-of-place issues.'' Both men spoke Tuesday. In <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Al-Thawra </ORGANIZATION> daily, mouthpiece of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Baath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, charged that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s insistence it share the vital Shatt-al-Arab waterway with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was hampering the negotiations. It accused <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> of seeking to string out the talks to `` buy time'' to rebuild its military forces. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have been observing a cease-fire since Aug. 20. The war began in September 1980. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s comments came as the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> auspices were suspended because of differences over troop withdrawals and <PERSON> Shatt-al-Arab </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s only outlet to the sea. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> Radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> urged Iranians to man the front lines in the now-dormant <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war, but also called for a national effort in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s post-war reconstruction. `` We must take it that we are still at war,'' the 88-year-old religious patriarch declared. He added: `` Our enemy, be it big enemies such as <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> or their surrogates such as -LRB- <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> President -RRB- <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> -RRB- and others, are constantly plotting because they have seen how <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> has become a major force in the world. We must never lose sight of that fact.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s state-run television network, also monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, showed <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> sitting on a sofa at his home in the north <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Jamaran </LOCATION> meeting with President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> and other senior figures. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> noted: `` It is possible that the enemy pretends now that the problem has been solved. But it's not true. People who are against us still exist and their numbers are large. We should not trust anything.'' <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> said that reconstruction of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s missile-battered cities and damaged industrial centers could not be accomplished in a short time. `` They pounded us for eight years and destroyed our cities. We must persevere so that, God willing, we may be able to do the job in a few years ... The people should cooperate and bring all their power to bear on this major issue.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said in a commentary that <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>'s claim of sovereignty over the 120-mile Shatt-al-Arab waterway, the southern border between the two countries before the war, was the main stumbling block in the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks. The Iraqis have said they consider the 1975 <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> agreement, which drew the boundary down the middle of the waterway, as invalid and claim the frontier should be on the eastern, Iranian, bank. <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> tore up the <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> document during a television appearance five days before the <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> invaded <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Sept. 22, 1980. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> insists that the <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> agreement is still valid.

<TEXT>
 The Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, invoking Democratic unity in November, moved to set aside bad feelings stemming from <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s criticism of the former presidential candidate in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary. The two were scheduled to meet today at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> office of Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, who arranged the meeting apparently to unify their support for the Democratic presidential nominee, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, noting that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has slipped in the polls since the Republican convention, said Tuesday, `` We've got to get that surge back. `` In fact, it may very well be that the surge will start with the meeting that <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and I have tomorrow if we jointly come out of that meeting united,'' the mayor said. But, he added, `` we have issues that separate us, no question about it.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, during a visit Tuesday to homeless people maintaining a vigil at City Hall Park, said there would be no discussion at today's meeting about <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s strong criticism of him in April's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> strongly endorsed Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> in the Democratic presidential primary and just as strongly opposed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, suggesting that Jews would be `` crazy'' to vote for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> because of his support for Palestinian self-determination in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Blacks all over the country reacted with outrage, as did many Jews. On Monday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said that although the mayor `` operated beneath the dignity of that office,'' the need for Democratic unity in November overrode other considerations.

<TEXT>
 Athletes who take high doses of steroids may risk addiction similar to narcotic abuse, doctors warn. In a letter in Thursday's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, doctors report a case of steroid dependence in a man who regularly took four kinds of steroids. The 23-year-old body-builder told doctors he could not stop taking anabolic steroids without experiencing withdrawal symptoms, depression and disabling fatigue. He said he sometimes felt uncontrollably violent, paranoid and suicidal. After a week off steroids, he told doctors that he could n't bear his depression, fatigue and drug craving and intended to resume taking the drugs. `` Some of the clinical features of this patient resemble those frequently observed in cases of opioid dependence,'' the doctors wrote. The letter was written by Drs. <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Projects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Covina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adolescent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Voy </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Olympic Committee. Other researchers have also pointed out that people who abuse steroids may suffer hallucinations, delusions, manic episodes and other temporary mental illness. According to one estimate, as many as 1 million athletes in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may be using steroids to build up their muscles. The drugs retard the tendency of muscle to break down. Steroids can also cause a variety of other side effects, including liver damage, sterility and testicular shrinking.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> announced a new currency devaluation and wage increases to shore up an economy he said has been damaged by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the Contra rebels. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> gave few details in a 40-minute speech Tuesday on state-run radio but said the measures would increase production and `` permit survival while working toward peace in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' A source who attended a closed-door meeting in Planning Minister <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuenca </PERSON>'s office after the speech said the government devalued its currency, the cordoba, from 80 to 180 per $ 1 at the official rate. The leftist Sandinista government normally conducts its foreign trade at the official rate. Wage hikes range from 60 percent for state agricultural workers to 35 percent for urban government workers, the source said. The average worker earned about $ 16 a month before the raise. `` The new exchange rate will stimulate exports, and the salary adjustments come as the first crops arrive at the markets,'' said the pro-government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuevo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said the measures were in line with reforms enacted in February, when inflation was running at an annual rate of more than 1,300 percent. Among those measures, the government issued a new currency valued at 10 per dollar. In June, it removed most wage and price controls. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> also updated the casualty toll to 54,000 in the seven-year civil war between the Sandinistas and the Contras. He said that figure included 28,000 dead and damages of $ 12 billion, but he did not break down casualties among government forces, Contras and civilians. `` The Nicaraguan people pay a high cost to be able to defend the revolutionary process,'' he said. `` The economic measures have a political basis and have to be seen in the revolutionary process, which has a socialist orientation.'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> renewed his call for direct talks with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, last held in 1984. `` We have insisted on direct talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> government to discuss national security issues, not internal subjects, and we maintain that position,'' he said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has rejected the idea of direct talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, who signed a preliminary cease-fire agreement with the Contras in March but saw peace talks break off in June.

<HEAD>Civil War, Food Shortages, Flooding Starving Refugees</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of people are fleeing civil war and food shortages in the southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, and many die during the trek northward or in flood-ravaged refugee camps, an opposition party said. An Irish relief official says millions of people face starvation in the south. A statement issued by the Union of Sudanese African Parties, a grouping of southern political parties, did not specify how many people who fled the fierce fighting and famine in the south were dying. `` I would not say by the thousands, but they are dying,'' said a spokesman, who spoke on condition of anomymity. The statement quoted the Bishop of el-Obeid, capital of <LOCATION> Kordofan </LOCATION>, 225 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, as saying people were flocking by the hundreds every day asking for food and help to continue their journey northward. `` This shows you how the food shortages and the long journey, which in some cases is done on foot, can kill women, children and old people,'' the statement said. The Rev. <PERSON> Aengus </PERSON> <PERSON> Finucane </PERSON>, director of the Dublin-based aid agency Concern, called for airlifts of food to regions of the country made inaccessible by the 5-year-old war. `` Two million people are facing death from the ravages of war and starvation,'' <PERSON> Finucane </PERSON> said at <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after returning from a two-week visit to <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s capital. Trains carrying thousands of `` living skeletons'' were arriving in the north every few days, and hundreds of other refugees trekked on foot to camps, he said. About 40 people per day were dying at refugee camps at <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Meriam </LOCATION>, 500 miles from <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Finucane </PERSON>. His organization has 34 workers in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. In 1983, the <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> _ made up mainly of Christians and animists _ took up arms against the Moslem majority government in the north. The <ORGANIZATION> SPLA </ORGANIZATION> claims to control 90 percent of the countryside in the south, with the army in command only in the major cities. Fighting between the army and the rebels has forced an estimated 820,000 southerners to leave their crops and cattle behind and seek shelter around the cities in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, where they become totally dependent on relief food for their livelihood. In <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, about 400,000 refugees live in extreme poverty in tin and canvas shacks around the city. These shantytowns were among the hardest hit areas in the worst floods in the country's history this month that sent the <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> over its banks. The floods have left 1.5 million people homeless, at least 91 dead, tens of thousands of homes destroyed and some of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s most fertile farmland inundated.

 <LOCATION> RUNDU </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Soldiers dismantled a pontoon bridge after army trucks carried the last South African troops out of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in an effort to end a 13-year-old civil war. Nearly 1,000 South African soldiers, who supported <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s anti-Marxist guerrillas, crossed into <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on Tuesday, said Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleeson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s army chief of staff The withdrawal completed the first phase of a U.S.-mediated cease-fire and peace plan aimed at ending the civil war in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> _ whose Marxist government is backed by thousands of <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> troops _ and granting independence to <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which is controlled by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` As of this moment, we are out of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gleeson </PERSON> said at a ceremony in this town on the Angolan border. He said there had been no truce violations. South African and foreign journalists were flown to <LOCATION> Rundu </LOCATION> to witness the pullout of the last South African forces. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> says it will grant independence to <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, after <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> withdraws its troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The Cubans reportedly have offered to leave <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in 24 months. An estimated 2,500 South African troops have gradually retreated to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> after a cease-fire was declared Aug. 8. The troops supported the National Union for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, which controls about one-third of the country. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> mediated peace talks and a cease-fire among <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, also backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, is not a party to the agreement. The four countries involved in the negotiations met last week in <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>, but failed to set timetables for withdrawal of the estimated 50,000 Cuban troops in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and for Namibian independence. Another round of talks is planned next week in <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION>. Cuban and Angolan officers serving on a cease-fire monitoring committee watched as soldiers dismantled the bridge across the <LOCATION> Okavango </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> while villagers washed their clothes nearby. The South African trucks crossing into <LOCATION> Rundu </LOCATION> carried troops and supplies, and some towed giant G-5 long-range cannons across the shallow river. Many of the vehicles had graffiti scrawled on them, such as `` No retreat, no surrender'' and `` Hello, mom.'' The troops were greeted by a banner that read, `` Welcome, winners.'' <PERSON> Gleeson </PERSON> said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> will not conduct any more raids into <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in pursuit of guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> He said <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, which has been fighting to end South African rule over <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, said it will observe a cease-fire starting Sept. 1. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has intervened in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> regularly since 1975, when it invaded the country on the eve of Angolan independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. South African army officers said their maximum strength in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> was 3,000 men, although other reports claimed the force was twice that size during battles in October.

 A man who killed himself with a pistol he bought less than a week earlier said in a suicide note `` it's actually scary'' how easy it is to obtain a handgun in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, his mother says <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Park </PERSON>, 31, who suffered from depression and had been disfigured in an auto accident, shot himself in a <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, hotel last week after mailing the note, dated Aug. 22, to his mother. Park had left his <LOCATION> Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION> home for <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> after buying the gun, said his mother, <PERSON> Elsie </PERSON> <PERSON> Banting </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Banting </PERSON> said Monday she was sure he bought the weapon within a week of his suicide. She added that showed the need for gun control. `` I'm hoping people will read about the death and pay attention and get angry,'' she said. `` I think it's terrible.'' Park was critically injured in a 1984 accident that severed an ear and broke his jaw in eight places. Reconstructive surgery helped, but he still was depressed, family members said. He was a waiter at the time of his death. `` I found out very recently how simple it is to buy a gun in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Park </PERSON> wrote, according to his mother. `` It's actually scary. No wonder the crime rate is so high. This may be an interesting case for gun control.'' Last year <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> reduced to two days `` cooling-off'' periods of up to a few weeks for buying a gun and eliminated other restrictions on handgun ownership. Critics, including police agencies, say the change has led to increased violence. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> had been arrested twice for drunken driving and was facing a court appearance when he disappeared. He also attempted suicide previously, slashing his wrists with a meat cleaver, said his brother-in-law, <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has resurrected the Iran-Contra scandal as a campaign issue against <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's top adviser said today <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had yet to explain his role in the arms-for-hostages affair. `` His role and participation in Iran-Contra and exchange of arms with the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> -RRB- for hostages is a very serious issue,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> said on `` CBS This Morning.'' `` He has n't answered that question.'' <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> said `` there's a very serious issue of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s judgment When he was supposed to be in charge of fighting the battle against terrorism ... he apparently endorsed a decision ... to trade arms with the ayatollah for hostages, which happens to be one of the most disastrous events in foreign policy history.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Tuesday questioned whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s failure to block the arms deal showed he lacked the judgment to be president. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was head of an anti-terrorism task force that shortly before the 1985 arms deal with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> issued a report warning against concessions to terrorist nations. The Democratic presidential nominee was spending most of today at the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Statehouse before flying to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for three days of campaigning in Western states. He spent Tuesday in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> on a gubernatorial trip, but took time to launch his harshest attack on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to date and declare that he was going to respond aggressively to Republican criticism. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in a meeting with area editors and later at a news conference, noted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s position as head of an anti-terrorism task force that shortly before the 1985 arms deal with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> issued a report warning against concessions to terrorist nations. `` The president and the vice president and a number of other people, over the opposition of the secretary of state and the secretary of defense by the way, proceeded to do precisely what that commission said you should never do,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` How can you possibly sit there and do nothing while we traded arms to a terrorist nation?'' he asked. At the news conference, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cited a new book by <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Sens. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> in which they said the Republican nominee appeared to have endorsed the arms-for-hostages deal. `` Making tough decisions is a test of leadership,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> endorsed the decision to sell arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and in doing so he failed that test.'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a Republican, and <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, a Democrat, were members of the congressional Iran-Contra investigating panel. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> was visiting with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> today. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, asked to respond to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s charges that he was too willing to make concession to the Soviets in arms negotiations, said the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people should match his record of making tough decisions with that of the vice president. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> mentioned the Iran-Contra affair, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's dealings with <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s support of deposed <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> in the early 1980s. `` I would be very concerned about someone with that kind of judgment negotiating with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor also returned <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s rhetorical salvos that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was soft on defense, and reiterated his opposition to the Star Wars anti-missile system, two new supercarrier task forces and rail-based MX missiles. `` Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he wants them all,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` You ca n't have them all, not if you're serious about providing the resources our conventional forces need and not if you're serious about getting that deficit down. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, characterizing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as irresponsible on fiscal matters, mentioned <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s support of the `` exotic'' weapons systems, increased education spending, a tax-credit for child care and a $ 40 billion cut in the capital gains tax. `` That is not a responsible approach to the basic fiscal problems, or for that matter the national security problems, which face our country,'' the Democratic nominee said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also lashed out against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s record on crime. `` What's the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> record? What's the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> record? I do n't know what the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> record is,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said `` It's a blank. On the rare occasions when the vice president has been asked to do something on this subject, it's been a failure.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he wished the campaign rhetoric was focused more on major issues but he adopted a more aggressive stance against <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> attacks, which have included questions about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' patriotism and jokes about his height. `` If it continues, you have to respond,'' he said. `` I think that's unfortunate, but I think it's very clear what kind of campaign the Republicans are running and I think we're going to have to deal with it.''

<HEAD>ABM Review Ends, US Statement Threatening Action</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said today it was not satisfied with the Soviet response to its concerns about radar under construction in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> and threatened to take action that could terminate or suspend the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. In a statement issued at the close of a one-week conference reviewing the ABM treaty, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation said `` the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> gave no indication that it was prepared to correct'' its violations of the treaty `` without linking their agreement to do so to unacceptable demands.'' The statement also made plain that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side now links dismantling of the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar to agreement in other arms control negotiations in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has also made clear that the continuing existence of the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar makes it impossible to conclude any future arms agreements'' in separate negotiations on reducing intercontinental nuclear forces, known as the START talks, and on space and defense systems, it said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> did not immediately issue its own statement, and the Soviet diplomatic mission said a spokesman was not immediately available. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> statement referred to the radar under construction at <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has long maintained constitutes a violation of the ABM treaty because it is not situated at the edge of the country, pointed outward, as the treaty stipulates such a radar must be. The statement said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has observed a slowdown in construction of the radar, but insists the radar must be dismantled. The statement said that the violation `` is very serious, especially when it is recognized that the radar constitutes one of a network of such radars'' that have the potential to support ballistic missile defenses. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side also raised the issue of Soviet deployment last year of two other radars in <LOCATION> Gomel </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, the statement said. The ABM treaty limits each side to deploying one ABM system comprising a radar and anti-ballistic missiles and constrains radars for early warning which could, because of their location, orientation and capability, contribute to an ABM defense. The aim is to prevent either side from creating a full, country-wide protective network, under the theory that neither side would launch a nuclear attack if it feared devastating retaliation. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has an ABM system deployed around <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not deployed one. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> statement called the radar a material breach of the treaty and said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` reserves all its rights, consistent with international law, to take appropriate and proportionate responses in the future.'' The statement did not elaborate on what those responses might be. But an information sheet distributed last week by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mission says that according to the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> Convention on the Law of Treaties, if one party charges `` material breach,'' it is entitled to invoke the breach `` as a ground for terminating the treaty or suspending its operation in whole or in part.'' Such action would apparently free the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to conduct uninhibited research and deployment of its Strategic Defense Initiative, currently in the research stage, which aims at creating a space-based missile defense. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has charged that some SDI research violates the ABM treaty, but in its public statements has not specified where it draws the line. Both sides link compliance with the ABM treaty to progress at other arms control negotiations under way in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has long made agreement on limiting SDI research a precondition for a START agreement. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has rejected such a linkage. The START talks have been going on in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> since March 1985. The two sides have agreed in principle on reducing their forces by 50 percent, but many issues remain to be resolved.

<HEAD>Discovery Astronauts, Control Crews Hold Final Rehearsal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The simulated failure of space shuttle Discovery's right engine forced astronauts to shift their craft into a low orbit as part of a final rehearsal for the first post-Challenger mission. The 56-hour simulation began Tuesday and involved about 300 people at Johnson Space Center. `` The first thing after launch, when they were going into orbit, the right engine failed so that they had to do what's called ` abort to orbit,''' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Selby </PERSON> said. `` That means the shuttle can still make it into orbit, but lower than planned, so they have to adjust their activities,'' Ms. <PERSON> Selby </PERSON> said. `` They did achieve the <ORGANIZATION> ATO </ORGANIZATION>, as we call it, and made the necessary adjustments to continue the mission.'' The shuttle crew faced another problem later Tuesday when they tried to deploy the $ 100 million communications satellite. A tilt table used to deploy the satellite stuck at a 24-degree angle. Two crewmen were to go outside the orbiter today to manually adjust the table to the needed 50-degree angle, Ms. <PERSON> Selby </PERSON> said. That simulation was to take place under water. Discovery's four-day mission will be the first shuttle flight since the Challenger explosion 2 -LCB- years ago. Commander <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>, pilot <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Covey </PERSON> and mission specialists <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilmers </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lounge </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> `` Pinky'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> are expected to face about 150 simulated problems during the test, which is to be completed Thursday evening. As many as 200 others are taking part in the rehearsal in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said. The launch of Discovery is slated for late September or early October, if sluggish oxygen valves and a hydrogen leak are repaired in time.

<HEAD>Vietnam To Resume Joint Search For Missing Americans</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> told the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> it is willing to resume joint searches for American servicemen missing in the Vietnam War. The decision was revealed in an Aug. 27 letter from Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> to retired Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON>, a special <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential envoy. A text of the letter, carried Tuesday by <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanoi </ORGANIZATION>, was seen today in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> told <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> in an Aug. 3 letter that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> was temporarily suspending full cooperation because of what he called <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s `` hostile policy'' toward <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> cited Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON>'s testimony before a congressional committee in July in which <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON> urged the continued isolation of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s envoy on humanitarian issues relating to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, replied to Thach two days later that <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON>'s testimony merely reflected the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration's `` longstanding viewpoint on relations with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.'' He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would continue implementing previous agreements with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and its humanitarian aid. <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> replied in his Aug. 27 letter that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` declaration that it will make the normalization of bilateral relations conditional upon the settlement of the MIA issues is at variance with the agreement between ... -LRB- <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> -RRB- and myself.'' But he said settlement of humanitarian issues `` should be separated from political issues.'' `` With the desire that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government will adopt a suitable attitude ... the Vietnamese side agrees to let the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side participate in joint investigation and survey activities as concerns the issue of American MIAs and is prepared to hold meetings of specialists from the two sides to discuss specific plans from 9 to 12 September 1988,'' <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> agreed in August 1987 that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> would accelerate its accounting of nearly 1,800 Americans listed as missing in action, or MIA, in the Vietnam War, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would give <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> humanitarian aid. <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> told <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> in July that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> would try to resolve 70 top priority MIA cases by the end of this year, and welcomed joint excavations and other searches for remains until October. There have been no joint excavations since the first was conducted in late 1985.

<HEAD>Explosion Wrecks Offices of Church, Anti-Apartheid Groups</HEAD>

 An explosion early today shattered a six-story office building used by church and anti-apartheid groups, and police said 23 people were injured. The structure was declared unsafe for further use. The type of explosive, which was believed planted in the basement parking garage, and the identity of the bombers were not known, police said. Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> blamed the attack on `` the perpetrators or supporters of apartheid.'' The injured included passersby, residents of nearby apartment buildings, and employees of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, the main occupant of the <ORGANIZATION> Khotso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which means <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> in the Zulu language. Several nearby shops and apartment buildings also were heavily damaged. The Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, general secretary of the council, said the blast destroyed the council's fleet of cars parked in a basement garage. He said police barred workers of <ORGANIZATION> Khotso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> from entering the building and expressed concern the council's files might be searched. It was the second explosion to wreck the <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> headquarters of anti-apartheid groups. Last year, the offices of the main black labor federation, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions, and several of its affiliates was severely damaged. The union congress described today's bombing as part of a `` continuous campaign against the opponents of apartheid'' and said it had heard nothing from police about investigations of the 1987 blast at its headquarters. <ORGANIZATION> Khotso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> serves as headquarters for the council of churches and the Black Sash civil rights group, two of the most prominent anti-apartheid organizations that so far have remained affected by government bans. Several other church and human rights groups have offices in the building, and it housed offices of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> before the nationwide coalition and 17 other groups were banned in February. The church council _ which represents most major <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> denominations except the Afrikaner-oriented <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> _ has taken a lead role in the anti-apartheid movement since the bannings. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, a leader of the church council and winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his anti-apartheid campaigning, said the bombing `` represents a new low in the behavior of those who seek to destroy the witness of the church against the evil and unchristian policies of the South African government.'' <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> said, `` The darkest forces of evil are arranging themselves against the church ... but we intend to continue telling the truth.'' A fire set off after the blast destroyed gas pipes in the basement. The floor of the main lobby collapsed into the basement, and a section of the facade was blasted open, strewing rubble into the street. City engineers and fire officials visited the building after the explosion at 1:10 a.m. and declared it unsafe for further occupation. The Rev. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Storey </PERSON>, a Methodist minister who formerly was president of the church council, called the bombing a `` bestial act.'' <PERSON> Storey </PERSON> later joined <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> at a news conference at a nearby Methodist church and told journalists the church office had received a telephoned bomb threat moments earlier. Last year, there was a series of unsolved bombings and arson attacks on offices of anti-apartheid groups and militant black labor unions. Activists suggested the attacks were carried out by right-wing vigilantes, either within or outside the security forces. This year, several restaurants and other civilian targets have been bombed. Authorities have blamed the attacks on the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement, which seeks to topple the white-minority government. Under apartheid, the nation's 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs and the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. State-of-emergency regulations in effect since 1986 restrict reporting about unrest, security force actions, treatment of detainees, some forms of protest, and a broad range of statements the government considers subversive. Enforcement of the regulations has not been comprehensive.

<HEAD>Iraq Attacking Kurdish Guerrillas With Troops And Poison Gas,
Kurds Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> attacked Kurdish guerrillas in northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> with at least 60,000 troops backed by fighter-bombers and helicopter gunships dropping poison gas, a Kurdish spokesman said today. `` Heavy fighting is taking place between our forces and the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> army on all fronts'' in the mountains of northeast <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, the official of the <ORGANIZATION> Kurdish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said in a telephone interview. He said the `` unprecedented'' Iraqi offensive, in which villages have been burned to the ground, was launched Monday all across the 4,000 square miles of Kurdish-held Iraqi territory. `` The army is deploying at least 60,000 troops, with tanks, aircraft, helicopter gunships, artillery and chemical weapons,'' he said. `` The army is burning down villages and killing people on sight and leaving carnage behind.'' The official, based in a West European capital, spoke on condition of anonymity for `` security reasons.'' There was no way to confirm the report independently. But Kurdish guerrilla groups have been bracing for an all-out Iraqi offensive for several weeks. The spokesman said casualty reports were sketchy because radio contact with the Kurdish stronghold south of the Turkish border was difficult. But he said Kurdish guerrillas destroyed <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s 66th special forces brigade, killing at least 400 men in the mountainous <LOCATION> Sidikan </LOCATION> region on Monday. He said 54 guerrillas and more than 100 Kurdish civilians were killed and that the Iraqis suffered `` heavy losses.'' The official said the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> forces comprised the northern-based 1st and 5th army corps reinforced with units of the elite <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, special forces and the 7th army corps normally based in the south. He said the Kurds had about 15,000 guerrillas backed by about 30,000 reservists. Diplomats in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has taken advantage of the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the eight-year war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to intensify operations against the Kurds, who seek autonomy and who sided with the Iranians. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, which is fighting its own Kurdish rebels, has allowed civilians fleeing the fighting into its territory on humanitarian grounds after appeals from <ORGANIZATION> Kurdish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Massoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Barzani </PERSON>, officials in <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION> said today. The party spokesman said <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> has announced that it will accept 30,000 refugees and that `` several thousand'' already have crossed into <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. He said the brunt of the Iraqi assault was aimed at rebel strongholds in <LOCATION> Zakho </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dahok </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mosul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Erbil </LOCATION> provinces. Iraqi jets dropped poison gas bombs, outlawed under a 1925 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> treaty, on villages and guerrilla positions in the <LOCATION> Zakho </LOCATION> region Monday and Tuesday, he said. It was not immediately known how many died from the gas attacks. But <PERSON> Barzani </PERSON> said 500 people were killed and 3,000 wounded in chemical attacks this month in the buildup to the offensive. The spokesman said: `` We have no gas masks, protective clothing, or antidotes for the chemical weapons. It's causing panic among the population.'' About 20 million Kurds live in the mountains where the Turkish, <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> and Iranian borders meet. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> also have Kurdish enclaves. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s 3.5 million Kurds have waged a sporadic war for an autonomous homeland for 50 years. Sources in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Nuzhei </PERSON> <PERSON> Kandemir </PERSON>, undersecratry of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, flew to the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital Monday and complained about the use of chemical weapons on the Turkish border. Kurdish and Iranian officials said more than 50 villages were hit by gas attacks in recent weeks. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has admitted using chemical weapons during the war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, but said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> used them first. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> denied that. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> has blamed <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for gas attacks on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> several times. The Kurds said 5,000 of their civilians were killed in March in gas attacks on <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION>, when it was captured by rebels aided by Iranian fighters. Foreign reporters taken to <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION> by the Iranians saw the bodies of hundreds of men, women and children sprawled around the town, unmarked by shrapnel or bullet wounds.

<HEAD>Pilots Union Chief Says Eastern Sought To Break Unions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' stalled plan to lay off 4,000 workers is part of a broader <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> effort to `` break the unions'' and gradually dismember the airline, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> charged today. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, whose group represents most unionized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pilots, expressed satisfaction with a federal judge's ruling Tuesday blocking Eastern from carrying out the layoffs. The financially strapped carrier said it would file an emergency appeal of the ruling. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> also ruled that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> could go ahead with plans to eliminate service to 14 cities and close its <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, hub. `` It's an important decision because what the judge found was a series of transactions that Eastern has been going through -LRB- that -RRB- has n't been for legitimate business purposes,'' <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show. `` It's been to break the unions.'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> declined an invitation to appear with <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> on the program. On Tuesday the Miami-based carrier issued a statement by its president, <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON>, calling the court ruling `` gravely wrong'' and saying it would appeal on grounds that any business must be allowed to `` prune money-losing operations.'' `` We must be able to take prudent, although sometimes painful, measures in the best interests of the company and our employees,'' Bakes said. Asked if his union believed Eastern's cutbacks in service and proposed layoffs were aimed at eventually doing away with the airline altogether, <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said: `` As a matter of fact, that's what the judge found. He found they've been siphoning assets off and transferring them over to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Airlines -RRB-.'' Both Eastern and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> are subsidiaries of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. In his ruling, <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> wrote that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, which bought <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, `` has exerted every effort to curb union influence at Eastern ...'' He also wrote that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s management had contributed to the carrier's financial instability through a series of decisions that led to `` a number of questionable loans and questionable ventures.''

<HEAD>Continental Cockpit Banter Violated FAA Regulations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Banter between the pilots of a <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> jet before it crashed Nov. 15, killing 28 people, apparently violated federal regulations, officials say. A previously undisclosed portion of the `` black box'' cockpit recording from the DC-9 shows that in the minutes before Flight 1713 crashed, the pilots discussed the dating habits of a woman flight attendant and other matters unrelated to the flight. The tape shows the pilots did not discuss the snow falling at <LOCATION> Stapleton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Both pilots, flight captain <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Zvonek </PERSON> and co-pilot <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruecher </PERSON>, were killed in the crash. Fifty-four people were injured. A <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> rule known as the `` sterile cockpit concept'' prohibits non-essential conversation in the cockpit during ground operations and takeoff preparations. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said a pilot who violated the rule could be suspended or fined as much as $ 10,000. `` That would definitely be extraneous,'' <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said Tuesday of the discussions between the two pilots. `` The main point is the cockpit crew is supposed to be concentrating on their primary business of flying the airplane. Distractions can be deadly.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> enacted the regulation in the late 1970s or early 1980s after `` several instances where we found in accidents where flight crews were talking about something other than flying the airplane,'' <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> said non-pertinent conversations are common among pilots. `` If the pilots on 1713 were in violation of that reg, 99.9 percent of all commercial pilots in history have violated that reg,'' he said. <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> had said previously that the pilots maintained a `` highly skilled, well-disciplined professional cockpit.'' The pilots' conversation has become an issue as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> studies possible causes of the accident, which occurred in a snowstorm. <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoagland </PERSON>, who retired as a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 captain this month, said such cockpit conversations are n't unusual. `` You ca n't just sit and be keyed right on the edge of the aviation experiences all of the time,'' he said. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbon </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arlington </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said that unless pilots anticipate a waiting period, it is unusual for them to spend much time discussing non-flight matters in a plane prpearing to take off in snow. `` If the weather's of concern, usually your attention is taken up by the business at hand,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> is to meet next month to review the accident. The board is studying whether ice or snow buildup on the wings, the experience and training of the pilots and possible turbulence from another aircraft caused the crash.

<HEAD>Soviets Confirm Sending Fighter Jets Into Afghanistan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A government spokesman today confirmed that Soviet-based fighter aircraft were used recently to aid Afghan ground troops as they battled for control of the northern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> denied, however, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charge that the action violated the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords on an Afghan settlement. He told reporters at a regular briefing that the Kremlin responded to an `` urgent situation'' when it sent the aircraft. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> denied another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allegation that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> had sent troops back to <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION>, about 30 miles from the Soviet border, after recently withdrawing them. Under the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords signed earlier this year, the Soviets have pulled out half of their 100,000 soldiers from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> since May 15, and the remainder is scheduled to be withdrawn by Feb. 15. <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said earlier this week that the Soviets had directed aircraft into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and moved some <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops into <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION> from elsewhere within the country. She said the dispatch of aircraft from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was a violation of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said the dispatch of aircraft was justified. `` When the Soviet troops left and part of the troops were still there, counterrevolutionary, anti-governmental gangs began to operate, so countermeasures were required,'' he said. He said he could not give specifics of the operations, declining to say how many fighters were dispatched to the area and whether the aircraft carried out any bombing. But he said the aircraft were there mainly as support. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> did not respond directly when asked whether the Afghan government requested the assistance, or whether the Soviets volunteered it. `` When in the area around <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION>, a critical situation emerged, then with the consent of the Afghan government, aircraft were used from Soviet territory for rendering urgent support including a Soviet unit fighting counterrevolutionary formations,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. The Soviets have persistently accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of violating the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords. The spokesman today reinterated the list of Soviet complaints, accusing <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of permitting guerrillas to operate bases inside the Pakistani border and blaming the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for its involvement. `` Nothing of this kind would have happened had <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, with the support of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, not supplied arms to the rebels, including advisers,'' he said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has said it will continue supplying <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> with weapons for the rebels as long as the Soviets continue arming the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said the rebels conducted a bloody fight in and around <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION>. `` They burned down three hospitals; they destroyed all governmental institutions, they destroyed several mosques, those freedom fighters. They blew up the power supply station, so <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION> remained without electric power. They killed officials, including members of their family. They killed traders, merchants and they took 200 schoolgirls and college students and away from <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. Rebel commanders have said their strategy is to take the provincial seats before an assault on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the capital.

<HEAD>CPAs Vote to Drop Ethics Ban on Accepting Commissions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLIFF EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Under pressure from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest organization of certified public accountants lifted its 82-year-old ban on CPAs' accepting certain fees and commissions. The ruling council of the 272,000-member <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Certified </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pubic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accountants </ORGANIZATION> voted 191-5 Tuesday to drop the prohibition against compensation for non-audit financial planning services. The ban was intended to avoid conflicts of interest among accountants, but officials said that dropping the restriction will benefit the consumer by allowing CPAs to compete against bankers and stockbrokers. `` We've been working on this change for five years, and we're just delighted that it occurred,'' said H.D Vest, an <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, accountant who threatened to sue the institute if it did n't drop the ban The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> last year issued a letter of complaint against the CPA group, threatening legal action unless it allowed accountants to accept commissions for non-audit work. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> contended the ban violated antitrust law. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> said the ban effectively prevented CPAs from competing in the financial services market. Since they could not accept commissions, they had no incentive to provide the services. Under the ban, accountants in most states could take no part in financial planning. `` -LRB- The change -RRB- allows consumers to go to one person who knows their situation best, and that one person, the CPA, will make the recommendation,'' Vest said in a telephone interview Tuesday. Vest said consumers will benefit most from the change because it will allow them to get business done `` under one roof.'' Licensing authority is actually held by the individual states, but the institute's code of ethics serves as a model for many state regulatory boards. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> had no immediate comment on the vote, said a woman at the commission's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> offices who did not give her name. Critics of the change focused on the conflict of interest issue, saying accountants could give biased advice to get a bigger fee, Vest said. The institute's policy change allows accountants to earn commissions in several areas, such as helping clients obtain loans, make acquisitions or mergers and devise cost-cutting plans, <PERSON> Vest </PERSON> said. Five states _ <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> _ already allow such commissions. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accountancy </ORGANIZATION>, whose members regulate CPAs, is expected to vote on a similar measure on Sept. 28.

<HEAD>Shiites Rally, Stage Strike To Mark Disappearance of Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bursts of gunfire resounded in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s southern suburbs today as Shiite Moslem factions rallied to mark the 10th anniversary of the disappearance of their spiritual leader, Imam <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadr </PERSON> A daylong general strike also was observed to mark the occasion. In a separate development, acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, an American-educated, moderate politician, was rushed to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> after a severe asthma attack. Gunmen of the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, dashed out of the <LOCATION> Bir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Abed </LOCATION> mosque where they were holding their rally as the firing began. They ordered reporters to leave the district. Syrian troops manning checkpoints around the mosque said the firing came from another neighborhood, five blocks to the west. The mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> faction was holding a separate rally in that area. `` Some militiamen fired their automatic rifles in the air,'' a <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> officer who spoke on condition of anonymity told reporters. `` We are searching the area for them.'' No casualties were reported. Government offices, banks, shops, restaurants and other businesses were closed in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and other towns and cities in south and east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as the Shiites observed the strike. The stoppage was called by Amal, which was founded by <LOCATION> Sadr </LOCATION> in 1974 as a social movement seeking better living conditions for the downtrodden Shiite community. The group took up arms a year later, when the Christian-Moslem civil war broke out. <LOCATION> Sadr </LOCATION>, who also headed the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, vanished on Aug. 31, 1978, while on visit to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. Libyan authorities said he left for <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, but Italian authorities denied he ever landed in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Amal has accused the Libyans of holding <LOCATION> Sadr </LOCATION>. The Islamic Amal, another Iranian-backed militia based in east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, sponsored a third rally in the city of <LOCATION> Baalbek </LOCATION>. There were no reports of any problems there. The 1.2 million Shiites form the largest single sect in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and their three militant groups are divided mainly over regional alliances and local politics.

 A Chinese jetliner with 89 people aboard skidded off a runway while landing in heavy rain today and broke apart in the sea. Officials said seven people were killed, including six crew members trapped in the submerged nose section. Fifteen people were reported injured, and 13 of them were hospitalized in fair or satisfactory condition. The airline said two of 12 Americans on board were injured. A rescue operation at <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s airport involving divers, a flotilla of boats and five helicopters began after Flight 301 plunged into <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> at 9:19 a.m. Later in the day, a huge floating crane lifted the crumpled jetliner from the water, and an investigation into the crash began. The bodies of the six crew members were found in the front part of the plane, according to <PERSON> Tsui </PERSON> <PERSON> Hin-cheuk </PERSON>, divisional commander of the fire services department. Officials said a passenger, a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> resident identified only by his surname <PERSON> Fung </PERSON>, died of head injuries. Earlier, small rubber rafts with rescue personnel bobbed around the partially submerged wreckage of the British-made Trident jet, which had arrived from <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> province 90 miles to the northwest. Fire engines crowded onto Kai Tak Airport's solitary runway, which juts into the harbor. `` It fell into the sea at the end of the runway,'' police spokesman <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Leung </PERSON> said of the jetliner. <PERSON> Tsui </PERSON> <PERSON> Hin-Cheuk </PERSON>, one of those overseeing the search and rescue operation, told reporters the six who died were trapped in the plane's nose section, which was submerged in shallow water just off the end of the runway. The plane, carrying an 11-member Chinese crew, is owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, that nation's flag-carrier. <PERSON> Tsui </PERSON> said one of the plane's engines was on fire when rescue workers arrived, but he did not elaborate. Government-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong </ORGANIZATION> interviewed one unidentified passenger who said some of the plane's safety belts did not work. `` That's why when the plane landed so hard, people simply were flying,'' the woman told the station. `` I was in the back. It did n't dawn on me that we were really out of control. I was thinking more of ... how I was going to get out.'' <PERSON> Kiyotaka </PERSON> <PERSON> Fukasawa </PERSON>, a 60-year-old Japanese passenger, told reporters that as soon as the plane hit the water, a flight attendant opened an emergency door so passengers could scramble out onto the wing and wait for rescue crews. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said bad weather caused the crash. Airline spokesman <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhengyou </PERSON>, when asked about the cause, said only, `` You know, today the weather is not very good.'' Heavy showers reduced visibility for much of the morning. The nationalities of most of the injured were not known. The airline did not release a passenger list from the plane, which can carry up to 100 people. Hospital officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, identified two of the injured as <PERSON> Heung </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheuk-Wu </PERSON>, a 38-year-old Chinese-American, and <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Allegre </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The airline said the uninjured included 10 Americans, 12 Japanese, 10 Chinese, 10 <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION>, and nationals from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. All incoming and outgoing flights at <LOCATION> Kai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tak </LOCATION>, a major transportation hub for <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, were delayed for nearly seven hours after the crash. It was the worst airline crash at <ORGANIZATION> Kai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tak </ORGANIZATION> since 1967, when a Thai International flight crashed into the harbor, killing 24 of 73 people on board. Two cargo planes have crashed at Kai Tak since, but no one was killed in those accidents.

 Authorities said today they caught two suspected <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> members as they tried to cross the border from the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> with weapons. Suspected <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas have carried out several attacks against <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> bases in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> over the past few months. In the last such attack, a bomb exploded at a British forces army barracks in <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> on Aug. 5. Five people were injured. `` There are grounds to believe that they belong to the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>,'' chief federal prosecutor spokesman <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview. `` An investigation is now under way,'' <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Suedwestfunk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION> reported earlier that the two men caught late Tuesday night carried a load of guns and explosives. The officials, however, said they could not confirm that the men had explosives. `` Two rifles and two pistols were found in the suspects' car. As far as I know, there were no explosives,'' <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> declined to release the mens' names, but said one of them had a British passport.

<TEXT>
 Republican presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today that `` the waiting period for action on acid rain is over'' and promised to support a program to reduce emissions by the year 2,000. In turning his attention to environmental issues, the vice president visited a park alongside <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> where he said the specifics of his acid rain program could be worked out later with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, `` but we must have a clear commitment to emissions reductions, a clear time table.'' Aides traveling with the vice president said his pledge was designed to demonstrate that he would go beyond the steps taken during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to clean up acid rain. The president has been criticized by environmentalists for failing to do more to solve the problem during his two terms in office. Earlier this month, however, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> gave the go-ahead for continuing negotiations toward <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> participation in an international treaty to freeze emissions of a precursor to acid rain. The administration had been divided on United Nations-sponsored negotiations in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, toward a treaty that would freeze emissions of nitrogen oxides until 1996. In a speech prepared for delivery, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I am an environmentalist, always have been, from my earliest days as a congressman ... and I always will be.'' Aside from acid rain, he proposed several steps to clean up the environment, including a global conference on the issue at the White House at which all nations would be welcome. He also called for implementation of a protocol already negotiated to limit emissions of nitrogen oxides. He said the Superfund established to clean up toxic waste dumps has enough money for the job and said the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> should use its authority to enforce a program. `` Polluters should pay,'' the vice president said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called for a `` zero tolerance'' policy for polluters similar to the one used to combat drugs. On the acid rain issue, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` the time for study alone has passed. ... As president I will ask for a program to cut millions of tons of sulfur dioxide emissions by the year 2,000 and to significantly reduce nitrogen oxide emissions as well.'' `` I will work out the exact amount and the exact methodology with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> addressed the environment issue on a brief campaign trip to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> regarded by strategists of both parties as a key battleground for the fall campaign. The state has 20 electoral votes. For the first time in several days <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made no reference to his Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in prepared remarks, but aides said the vice president was considering a trip to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> later in the week to dramatize a pollution problem in the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's home state. Later in the week, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has proposed a ban on ocean dumping, also will visit several beach sites in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides said that the vice president would continue his environmental pitch on a campaign swing to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> that will begin on Labor Day. The aides said this may follow a joint appearance with running mate Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> at a park in <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, across from the Statue of Liberty, where <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> launched his campaign on Labor Day 1980. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday wound up four days of attacks on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' defense stands by telling an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legion </ORGANIZATION> post at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Campbell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, he had `` deep, wide and worrisome'' differences with the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee on defense issues `` If he does n't want to modernize his snow blower, that's his concern,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` But if he does n't modernize our weapons systems, that puts the national security of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in considerable risk.'' The barbed reference to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' decades-old snow blower, highlighted in a film at the Democratic National Convention, brought cheers from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s audience of military veterans. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a decorated World War II torpedo bomber pilot, described himself as `` tested in combat'' in his talk in which he did not mention <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, whose service in the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> during the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war has become a heated campaign issue. However, at an earlier rally Tuesday at <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wesleyan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> voiced strong praise for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` I'm proud of my running mate ... It's nice to have a running mate going in the same general direction as I am ... We'll do just fine,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told several thousand students. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stood firmly behind his decision to agree to no more than two presidential debates with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, suggesting any more would bore <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> viewers. The Democrats are asking for three debates between <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> representatives broke down on Tuesday after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Campaign Manager <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> refused to budge from the two-debate format, with an additional debate for vice presidential contenders. Talks were to resume on Thursday. `` This is a firm position ... This is our only offer,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chief of staff <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>.

 Hundreds of protesters demonstrated from hilltops and in a flotilla of small boats today as two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships capable of launching nuclear missiles arrived at the home port of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 7th Fleet. The two ships are the first to be stationed in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> with launchers for Tomahawk missiles, which are made in both nuclear and non-nuclear versions. `` Get out from <LOCATION> Yokosuka </LOCATION>!'' 100 people shouted in English at the gates of the naval base as the Ticonderoga-class, guided missile cruiser USS Bunker Hill and the destroyer USS Fife arrived in the port, 30 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. A coast guard official said the warships arrived without incident. Forty-two coast guard patrol boats escorted the ships into the port to prevent the approach of 28 small boats carrying protesters and banners reading `` No Tomahawks,'' the official said. He spoke on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> forbids the production, possession, or introduction into the country of nuclear weapons. Nearly 200,000 people died in the Japanese cities of <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION> in the world's only atomic attacks, during World War II. After the arrival of the ships, more protesters from civic and peace groups, labor unions and the <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Communist Party staged separate rallies at a park overlooking the port, outside the naval base and elsewhere. Police reported no arrests. Protesters said the biggest rally, sponsored by the communists, drew an estimated 1,000 people. On Tuesday, <LOCATION> Yokosuka </LOCATION>'s 48-member city assembly unanimously passed a resolution calling on the government to cancel the arrival of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships. The mayor and governor lodged official protests Monday with the Japanese government, saying it had not done enough to ensure that the ships were not carrying nuclear weapons. Local officials and civic groups have charged the ships may be carrying nuclear-tipped Tomahawk missiles, in violation of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s anti-nuclear policy `` We hope our grassroot struggles will spread to a national movement,'' said <PERSON> Yoshiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Saito </PERSON>, a leader of a citizens' group staging a sit-in near the <LOCATION> Yokosuka </LOCATION> city hall. Both the 9,600-ton <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> and the 7,810-ton Fife are capable of deploying Tomahawk missiles. Under a security agreement, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has pledged to notify <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> if it plans to bring nuclear arms into the country. However, critics charge the Japanese government uses the agreement as a way of avoiding the question of whether <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships dock in the country with nuclear weapons aboard. Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> told reporters today that the government would not ask the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to confirm whether or not the ships were carrying nuclear missiles, because `` we trust each other in such matters,'' <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military, which has 50,000 personnel stationed in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, maintains a policy of not publicly confirming or denying the existence of nuclear weapons aboard its ships.

Manning and <PERSON> Laaman </PERSON> already have been sentenced to long prison terms for related crimes. `` In light of the lengthy consecutive sentences now imposed on both <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> and <PERSON> Laaman </PERSON>, it is not in the interests of justice to prosecute either man further,'' <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON> said in a statement. Dropping the charges `` will, by effectively shortening the jury selection process, allow the remaining defendants to proceed more expeditiously to trial, without substantially compromising any public interest,'' the statement said. Manning and <PERSON> Laaman </PERSON> were named in a 1986 indictment charging them with violating the Racketeer Influenced and <ORGANIZATION> Corrupt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION> statute and federal seditious conspiracy laws. <PERSON> Laaman </PERSON>'s 53-year federal sentence and additional 39 - to 45-year state sentence were upheld on appeal earlier this year He was convicted of six bombing charges and one charge of conspiracy. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> convictions involved the attempted murder of two state troopers. <PERSON> Laaman </PERSON> will not be eligible for parole until Dec. 22, 2008. <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> also faces a 53-year sentence that has been upheld on appeal. He was also sentenced to 25 years to life for the murder of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> State Trooper. <PERSON> Laaman </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlang </PERSON>, said the defense team would file motions asking that <PERSON> Laaman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> be allowed to stay at the <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> jail where the defendants are housed to help them in the defense.

<HEAD>Chubb Agrees To Refunds, Payments; Won't Extend Deadline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hundreds of Midwestern farmers who claim an insurance company reneged on its summer drought insurance must meet today's deadline if they want to apply for premium refunds, lawyers said. Farmers can apply for the refunds or even double refunds without forfeiting the right to sue the <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> of insurers for damages, according to an agreement filed Tuesday between lawyers for farmers and <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION>. A federal court here is hearing a class-action suit on behalf of farmers who bought drought insurance from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. `` It is simply stating that the double-payment is not going to prejudice anyone,'' said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, one of four lawyers representing the farmers. He declined to comment further. The insurance companies `` have agreed that farmers may accept premium refunds and matching payments without jeopardizing any claim for payments due under the policies,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Geibelstein </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Davenport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, lawyer who also represents the farmers in the suit. But the statement, issued by <PERSON> Geibelstein </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chesley </PERSON> and lawyers <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> A. Van of <PERSON> Davenport </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. Freed of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, noted that <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> refused to extend its Aug. 31 deadline for accepting refunds and double-premium reimbursements to farmers who bought drought insurance coverage that was subsequently denied. Farmers must apply in letters postmarked no later than today to <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> for the refunds. Farmers in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> say <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> sold them drought insurance but failed to pay their claims for damage from this year's drought. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> announced in July that agents had oversold the insurance and began to return premium checks. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> then issued some policies and offered other farmers a double-premium bonus payment, but some state insurance regulators have called the offer inadequate.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign manager said today the Democrats would use the selection of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee to question <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s judgment and leadership in the upcoming fall campaign `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is going to emerge not only as an issue, but as a liability on the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> side because it goes to judgment and it goes to leadership,'' top campaign aide <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> said at a briefing on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign stragegy. `` We start this campaign on a solid footing in a close competitive race,'' said <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>. She said both the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> were preparing separate advertising campaigns to air Labor Day week. The party's advertising campaign will highlight the theme `` bringing prosperity home,'' while the initial campaign ads would focus on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' record as governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, portraying him as a skilled administrator capable of implementing his goals of an improved economy and better jobs. `` It's our sense right now that voters have only scant information of what <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has accomplished,'' she said. `` There is a lot of misinformation out there and we're going to correct it,'' said <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>, an indirect acknowledgment that <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has scored well in recent weeks with attacks on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on such issues as his veto of legislation to require the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> schools. <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Corrigon </PERSON> flatly denied they had ever suggested to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> that he avoid campaigning in such states as <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. A source close to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said such a request was made and then withdrawn when <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> objected to the suggestion he ought to stay out of states where he outpolled <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the Democratic primaries. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> finished ahead of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in all of those states except <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s role in the fall campaign has not yet been settled. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has been dividing his time between Statehouse duties and campaigning as the Democratic presidential nominee, will stay on the road five to six days a week after the holiday. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was traveling today to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, and after Labor Day he will start a trip through the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> that will include a joint appearance with running mate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> at a labor rally in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, a Texan, will carry much of the burden of the attacks on his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> colleague from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. Still unresolved, however, was what onetime presidential contender <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would do, especially when and where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would make joint appearances. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> met in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Thursday with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> to discuss the campaign, but very little was settled, according to one participant who asked not to be identified. The source described <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as upset by a request, later dropped, that he avoid appearances in several states, including three that he carried in the Democratic primaries. <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign spokesman, confirmed the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> meeting took place but was unable to provide details. A <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporter said the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides had a list of states _ <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ where they did not want him to campaign. They said they were concerned that his negative ratings were so high in those states that he might hurt the ticket. <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said there was no such list. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and his supporters said he beat <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the Democratic primaries or primary-like caucuses in all of those states but <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. That dispute reportedly ended with the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides dropping their objections and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> saying he would campaign in all but <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, officials of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign met with their counterparts in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign to negotiate a debate schedule and format. After a meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> said the two camps were far apart on arrangements for candidate debates. `` We want more debates, they want fewer,'' said <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>. `` We want to start them earlier, they want to start them later. `` We want to continue them up until the election takes place. They would like to end them much earlier.''

<HEAD>Bloody Script for Witch Movie Turns Off Mayor</HEAD>

request; Picks up 4th graf, `The mayor ...'</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MOUNT DORA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Early enthusiasm for the filming of a horror movie in this town with a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> flavor has given way to, well, expressions of horror. The film's `` purpose is to see how many people can be killed and how gruesomely they can be killed, and I just do n't think the city wants to cooperate with any of that,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Book </PERSON>. Book called on <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to declare a moratorium on movie-making here because of plans for the filming by an Italian-American company of `` Witch Story.'' But the council rejected the mayor's request after dozens of residents and business people supported the filmmakers at a special meeting Tuesday night. `` The last thing this city council wants to do is try to legislate morality,'' said Vice President <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Liveright </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dora </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. The mayor would like to see ground rules established for any future movie projects in this central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> town. In 1980, many downtown businesses were painted pink for the movie `` Honky Tonk Freeway.'' That was fun, many residents agreed, although the movie was a box-office flop. So town officials were excited last week when <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it wanted to film a witch story here because of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dora </LOCATION>'s New England-style architecture and ambiance. That enthusiasm lasted only until the mayor got a look at the script. The low-budget `` splatter'' film is `` revolting and offensive,'' <PERSON> Book </PERSON> said. The script calls for a gang rape, a crushed skull, an exploding child, a couple pureed in bed, a decapitation, a blood bath, an exploding stomach and an exploding teen-ager, among other nasty business. The witch would be dragged through city streets, repeatedly raped and then burned at the stake. `` Some horror films, like some of <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON>'s or ` The Shining,' are made with great style,'' said Book. `` But this is just garbage. I do n't think the city wants to be part of it.'' <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> <PERSON> Pascal </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the production company, said company executives talked to Book about his concerns and would meet with city officials. The film is in the planning stage, and no production has begun. `` There are some things we might be able to do with the script. We'd love to stay in <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dora </LOCATION>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Pascal </PERSON> said. `` But it is a horror movie.'' Book said changing a few scenes would not help. `` If you deleted all the offending scenes in this script, you'd have to start all over with a new script,'' he said. `` We want to improve on ` Honky Tonk Freeway,' not go down in quality,'' the mayor added.

<TEXT>
 The government today warned demonstrators who have taken over state offices to leave them immediately. Soldiers, meanwhile, went from house-to-house searching for striking engineers who closed <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s largest oil refinery, sources said. The engineers and other workers have gone on strike to press for democracy. Also today, 1,200 more prisoners were released from Insein Jail in the capital and another prison in the central city of <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION>, the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> said. Authorities have been freeing prisoners after disturbances last week at these and seven other jails. `` The government has permitted peaceful assembly and processions under the constitution,'' the radio broadcast also said. `` In some towns, <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- local government -RRB- offices and other government buildings are illegally occupied by the people.'' `` Illegal occupants must vacate the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> offices and government buildings immediately or face the consequences,'' said the statement signed by <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Ko </PERSON>, secretary to the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION>, or the Cabinet. The broadcast did not specify the possible consequences. Scarce gasoline supplies and a 5-day-old strike by railroad workers continued to cripple the nation's transportation system, contributing to food shortages, a Western diplomat said. The government has remained silent on the strikers' demands, and spreading violence and disorder have given rise to rumors of an impending military coup. Some observers say the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is orchestrating the chaos in order to intervene and re-establish itself. Authorities on Tuesday freed hundreds of inmates from <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> jails. Striking employees from more than 120 government departments and state-owned corporations on Tuesday formed a committee to agitate for an end to one-party rule. Their All Services General Strike Committee was the fourth illegal association created in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> in three days. Students and dock workers also have formed unions and 21 elder statesmen, some associated with the last elected government 26 years ago, created a <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>. In addition, citizens have formed committees in an attempt to govern many <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> cities, which were left without authorities when troops and officials loyal to the embattled government cleared out. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s turmoil began after the July 23 resignation of ruler Ne Win, who ended democracy with a 1962 military coup, established one-party rule and outlawed all other parties, unions and associations. Thousands of citizens staged protests against Ne Win's hard-line successor, <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, and at least 112 people were killed in clashes with security forces. The violence continued until <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> resigned and was replaced Aug. 19 by civilian lawyer <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>. Since then, peaceful rallies and widespread strikes demanding an end to one-party rule have continued. The strikes have paralyzed most government services and industries, including the country's only oil refineries _ in <LOCATION> Syriam </LOCATION>, about 10 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, and in the central city of <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>. Severe gasoline shortages has forced transportation to a crawl. Workers at the <LOCATION> Syriam </LOCATION> refinery _ which had produced 26,000 barrels of oil per day _ staged an occupation strike after students called for a nationwide general strike two weeks ago. The plant was shut down and military engineers tried in vain to operate it. On Tuesday, authorities ordered soldiers to begin house-to-house searches for civilian engineers from the refinery to force them back to work, an engineer told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> today. So far, the soldiers have n't found the striking employees, said the engineer, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said he and his colleagues have gone into hiding and would strike until authorities form an interim government to lead the country to democracy.

<TEXT>
 A senior <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> official said today he does not accept as permanent the decision of King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> to sever his government's ties with the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamir </PERSON>, director general of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters that <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> is well aware that it is impossible to reach a `` final stage solution'' between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> without <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> knows that `` some day he will be called back to negotiate on the final status because without <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, you ca n't solve the problem He knows it very well,'' <PERSON> Tamir </PERSON> said. A month ago, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> announced he was `` dismantling the legal and administrative links'' between <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, a move that was seen by some as a setback for hopes that a regional peace settlement might be reached. <PERSON> Tamir </PERSON> suggested that it is unrealistic to assume that <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> could sever its historical ties to an area it once ruled, noting that the Camp David agreement envisions a role for <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in the final stages of negotiations. At the same time, there have been repeated hints over the past month that <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s move may induce the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to initiate a proposal for peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tamir </PERSON>, who is here for talks with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, said there is an urgent need to end the turmoil in the occupied territories and move toward a settlement through negotiations. As a result of Palestinian unrest dating back eight months, a `` very dangerous'' situation has been created, he said, adding that it would be unwise to allow the status quo to exist much longer. He rejected the view of those who say that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` can wait and wait and wait,'' expecting that the Arabs `` will crawl on their knees and be ready to accept a peace on the basis of our conditions.'' To get a negotiating process started, <PERSON> Tamir </PERSON> said `` we have to mobilize all forces'' starting with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in support an effort to reach an interim agreement with leaders of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. As long a serious peace talks are delayed, he said the uprising in the territories will continue and that the situation could deteriorate into another Arab-Israeli war.

It also raises questions about the government's counterintelligence capabilities ... It's evident that too many people hold security clearances to handle classified documents. And handing out clearances to so many young military people, most not mature enough to handle the responsibility, is a questionable practice. ... The government may have to consider draconian measures to stop the flight of secrets to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations and elsewhere. More rigorous investigations and follow-ups as well as workplace surveillance are not pleasant prospects but it may be coming to that. In some instances, it's a matter of sloppy security practices.

Sadly, the vice president has squandered several opportunities to say something meaningful by instead dwelling on the fact that as governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> vetoed a bill that would have imposed criminal fines on teachers who failed to lead their class in the Pledge of Allegiance. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> correctly nixed the bill because of state and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings that such laws are unconstitutional. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> claims he would have signed it anyway. Does this mean he has little respect for <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> interpretations of the Constitution or that he holds the Constitution in as little regard as some other <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials have? Why has <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> insisted on beating this non-issue into the ground? He should be above such cheap shots. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> can show real leadership and character by rising from the mud and dwelling on the issues _ and by doing so with specifics, not platitudes.

But repeated instances of hypocrisy are another matter altogether. It seems <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> holds two standards, one for the nation, and another for himself.

But as <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s National Guard escapade reveals, there's another private man behind the public mask who does not live out the values he espouses. Despite his heavy-handed war philosophy, given the opportunity to fight, he has dodged dangerous assignments. His rhetoric honoring the family sings pure Republican. But the private man has felt no compunction against propositioning a <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> model, or even carousing in that set of company. There, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> the private man has revealed himself to be an opportunist, his personal politics and morality vulnerable to the convenience of the moment. ... That he has tried to rationalize the way he exempts his own behavior from the code he holds to the nation should disappoint the public. That he feels free to condemn anyone who points to the inconsistencies suggests he is too immature to face himself.

 Aug. 28 The <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION> -RRB- News-Sentinel on profiting from the drought: `` Hey, have n't you heard about the drought?'' That's a standard reply these days to complaints about the high cost of putting food on the table. Cost-of-living statistics for July showed that the overall inflation rate for that month was 0.4 percent, but the jump in supermarket prices was 1.4 percent. The price of bread made from wheat harvested before the drought has gone up sharply. Cereals made from pre-drought grain have climbed. What about beef? Prices were supposed to go down because cattle raisers and many dairy farmers have been dumping animals on the market to avoid having to feed them. But ... beef prices in stores have n't dipped and some have gone up. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratajczak </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s economic forecasting center says that `` perhaps half'' the increased prices recorded on supermarket shelves can be traced to the drought.

Shoppers can pass up purchases of items they suspect have been deliberately overpriced. Unsold foodstuffs piling up in stores would send a message all along the food chain that consumers are tired of taking it in the neck.

The explanation most often heard for inflation is that the economy is growing too fast. Technically, that's true, a robust economy fueled by rampant consumer spending but an inadequate supply of goods and services, always forces prices up. ... Those who favor real victory over the inflationary monster should look at low productivity, not consumers, as the culprit. Raise productivity and you give the economy the ability to meet the consumers' rising demand. To do this, American productivity has to grow at a far greater rate than it has in recent years. But the best ways for a government to promote higher productivity _ lowering business taxes to permit companies to keep more of their profits and invest in new equipment _ are not necessarily the most politically popular. ... Whoever will lead the nation from January 1989 on will have to show the moxie to battle inflation and the intellectual ability to understand its relation to productivity.

 An <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bomb exploded today in an apartment in a Roman Catholic section of <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>, killing a man and a woman who accidentally triggered the blast by climbing through a window, police said. The Irish <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> apologized for the killings and said the bomb was intended for British soldiers known to be checking houses in the area. Also today, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said three of its members killed by British soldiers on Tuesday were `` on active service,'' the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s term for a guerrilla mission. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, officials said they caught two men believed to be <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas as they tried to cross the border from the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> with weapons. The pair was apprehended around midnight near a British air base. Police said another man was injured when the bomb demolished the apartment in <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s second-biggest city. A police spokesman, Sgt. <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Winters </PERSON>, said the victims were innocent neighbors who were worried that a young man living in the apartment had not been seen for several days. <PERSON> Winters </PERSON> said the man who climbed inside accidentally triggered the bomb, demolishing the apartment in the mainly Roman Catholic Creggan area. He said police were investigating reports that the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> had kidnapped two occupants of the home several days ago and held them at gunpoint while planting the bomb. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION> unit circulated an apology to local news media saying the bomb was intended for an army search squad. `` Although the operation was carefully planned, it went tragically wrong. At no stage, unfortunately, was it anticipated that a member of the public would enter the flat -LRB- apartment -RRB- through a front window and open a booby-trapped door.'' <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> police and the British army released few details of Tuesday's ambush and killing of the three <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas on a country road at <LOCATION> Drumnakilly </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tyrone </LOCATION>. The spot was only eight miles from <LOCATION> Ballygawley </LOCATION>, where an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bomb blew up a military bus Aug. 20, killing eight soldiers and injuring 27. British media reports said commandos of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s elite <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> regiment ambushed and killed the three men as they prepared to attack a soldier of the locally recruited <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION>. The police and army refused to comment on the reports. <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, legal political wing of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday the slain men were <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members. It identified them as <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> and brothers <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Harte </PERSON>. Today, it released a statement from the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mid-Ulster </ORGANIZATION> battalion saying the men were killed while `` on active service.'' The killings were seen as the start of a tougher British policy to combat increased <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> attacks. So far this year, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> has killed 27 members of the British security forces in gun and bomb attacks in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, mainland <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and continental <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in its fight to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. With Tuesday's deaths, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> has lost 11 members so far this year. British news reports said <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> was one of eight men questioned by police after the Aug. 20 bus bombing. The government's <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> Office refused to say if the shootings were a result of new security measures in the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province. Security forces have denied accusations they operate a so-called shoot-to-kill policy, in which suspects are gunned down without being given a chance to surrender. On March 6, British commandos killed three unarmed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas on a bombing mission in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>. The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> province and to unite it with the overwhelmingly <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Ex-Aide Said Nixon Wanted On-Off Button For White House Taping</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 While the infamous White House taping system was being planned, President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> suggested that he have a button to turn it on and off manually, but was dissuaded by an aide who says he thought the president was too clumsy. Therefore, a voice-activated system was installed and <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> quickly lost awareness that his every conversation was being recorded, says former White House chief of staff H.R. <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON> in an article for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> publication `` Prologue.'' The tapes led to <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s resignation in August 1974 when they provided damning evidence that he had consented to the White House cover-up of the Watergate break-in. <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> had resisted the idea of taping conversations but reluctantly agreed it was the best way to get an accurate record of meetings. `` He suggested we might install the same kind of switch - or button-operated machine that -LRB- <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> had used. <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON> wrote. `` That would allow him to turn the system on or off as he thought best.'' The former aide continued: `` I responded, ` Mr. President, you'll never remember to turn it on except when you do n't want it, and when you do want it you're always going to be shouting _ afterwards, when it's too late _ that no one turned it on. `` I added, silently, in my own thoughts, that this president was far too inept with machinery ever to make a success of a switch system.'' The taping system that finally was installed was activated by the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s locator system which keeps track of the president's whereabouts. Eventually, five microphones were put in the president's desk, two were in wall lamps at each side of the fireplace on the opposite side of the Oval Office, and there were others in the Cabinet Room, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s office in the Old Executive Office Building and at Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, the presidential retreat. `` The historiography of the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration will eventually be much the richer as a result of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s decision to tape-record his meetings and telephone conversations,'' <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON> writes. `` <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> was not thinking of historians when he made this decision, but they will be the ultimate beneficiaries.'' <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON>'s account is much softer in tone and less critical of <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> than when he described the same events in a 1978 book, `` The Ends of Power,'' which he said `` was unfortunately sensational in many instances where I would have preferred it to be more reasoned and thorough.'' In the book, <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> had `` fudged'' the tape story in various ways, `` climaxing with the assertion on television in 1977 that he had ordered me to destroy all of the tapes.'' There is no reference to that in the Prologue article. <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON> says he is amazed how quickly he forgot about the system once it was in place. `` For a short time, I worried that it might not be working, and I dispatched someone to test the machinery,'' he writes. `` But the worry quickly passed, as did any awareness at all that <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s conversations _ my conversations, often _ were being taped I think <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> lost his awareness of the system even more quickly than I did.'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> himself has written that `` initially I was conscious of the taping, but before long I accepted it as part of the surroundings.'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> fired <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON> in April 1973 at the height of the cover-up of the June 1972 break-in, when burglars placed bugs in telephones and searched files in <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in the Watergate Office Building. <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON> served an 18-month prison term for his part in the affair. <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON> said he chose to write about the taping system because the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> plans to release 60 hours of the recordings next year for public listening.

<HEAD>GAO Raps Education Dept. For Student Loan Errors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Education Department may be paying banks and other lenders millions of dollars each year in excess subsidies on student loans, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The congressional watchdog agency said the department performs an inadequate job of checking the accuracy of the bills that lenders submit for their government-subsidized interest payments. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> auditors who reviewed 2,038 loan accounts at 16 major lenders found 18 percent were in error or lacked adequate documentation to support the amount billed. `` The cause of these errors varied, but generally resulted from lenders' miscalculating loan principal balances and interest subsidy due, and continuing to bill the department after borrowers began repaying,'' the report said. Based on the errors found in the loan accounts it reviewed from a three-month period in 1985, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> estimated that the government overpaid the 16 lenders at least $ 1.8 million for that quarter, when they received a total of $ 69.4 million in interest subsidies. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said three lenders had voluntarily repaid the government $ 345,071 in interest subsidy overbillings from that quarter and other recent billing periods. The department paid lenders $ 2.4 billion in interest subsidies on $ 39 billion of outstanding guaranteed student loans in 1986. An estimated 14,000 lenders _ banks, savings and loan associations, life insurance companies and credit unions _ make the loans. The government guarantees repayment of the loans and pays all the interest until six months after the student leaves college. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>'s inadequate oversight could be costing the federal government millions of dollars each year in interest subsidy overpayments to lenders in the guaranteed student loan program,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> recommended that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> amend the Higher Education Act to allow the education secretary to charge lenders interest on overpayments and require lenders to have independent auditors verify their loan accounts and interest billings. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it agreed generally with the report and already was taking steps to improve its ability to detect interest billing errors. `` We believe the department currently has the authority to assess interest on overpayments,'' the department said, adding that it does not oppose amending the law to spell out that authority.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jetliner sounded normal as it took off, then seemed to drag its tail and plunged to the ground in a ball of fire and `` a cloud of smoke about three stories tall,'' witnesses said. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727, Flight 1141, crashed today on takeoff from <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> with 104 people aboard. `` I was coming over the bridge on I-30 in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, and I saw a big ball of fire going into the air,'' <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> told <ORGANIZATION> KRLD </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. `` I started driving over there and it looked like it was over near <LOCATION> DFW </LOCATION>, and I thought, ` No way could it be an airplane accident ...' `` It was an unbelievably big explosion.

Then I watched it put its tail into the ground and exploded in a huge ball of fire.'' <PERSON> Chip </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> arrived at the scene minutes after the crash. `` There were probably three different colors of smoke coming out of the fuselage,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. `` The entire half of the plane from the wings back were on fire and charred. Part of the fuselage was cracked above the wing. `` There was n't as much fire as there was three types of smoke but the whole area around the plane was on fire.'' Passengers on the plane `` had no idea what happened,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeks </PERSON>. `` The plane had slid sideways about the last 100 yards on the ground,'' Weeks said. `` It was n't a violent crash. It was n't cartwheeling or anything like that.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised today to solve the acid rain problem by reducing emissions by the year 2,000 and declared `` I am an environmentalist, always have been.'' Aides to Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said they would use <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s selection of <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as his running mate to question the Republican nominee's judgment. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the campaign were preparing separate advertising campaigns to kick off the fall campaign after Labor Day. Among the campaign's targets for the fall: the choice of the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket. `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is going to emerge not only as an issue, but as a liability on the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> side because it goes to judgment and it goes to leadership,'' <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> said at a briefing on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign strategy. The Democratic nominee raised questions about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s leadership ability on Tuesday in resurrecting the Iran-Contra scandal, asking, `` How can you possibly sit there and do nothing while we traded arms to a terrorist nation?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> said today that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has yet to explain his role in the arms-for-hostages deal, which creates a `` very serious issue of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s judgment.'' His comments came on `` CBS This Morning.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was to continue his attack on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s role in the scandal at an afternoon news conference with <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who served on the congressional panel investigating the affair and co-authored a newly published book on Iran-Contra. The vice president, who turned his attention to the environment during a brief campaign stop alongside <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, proposed several clean-up measures as well as a global conference on the issue. `` The time for study alone has passed. ... As president I will ask for a program to cut millions of tons of sulfur dioxide emissions by the year 2,000 and to significantly reduce nitrogen oxide emissions as well,'' he said. Aides traveling with the vice president described his pledge as a step beyond <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policy. Environmentalists have criticized the president for dragging his feet on acid rain and other issues during his tenure. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proclaimed, `` I am an environmentalist, always have been, from my earliest days as a congressman ... and I always will be.'' The vice president, for the first time in several days, made no reference to his Democratic rival, but aides said he was considering a trip to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's home state to dramatize the pollution problem <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, meanwhile, traveled to <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> with his wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, as part of a five-state southern swing. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign today tried to dispel reports of lingering tension between the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> over how the former candidate would campaign for the Democratic ticket. <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Corrigan </PERSON> denied they had ever suggested to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> that he avoid campaigning in such states as <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Sources who spoke only on condition of anonymity said Tuesday that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> resisted attempts to limit the states in which he campaigns, but it was still unresolved where and when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would appear together. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ridiculed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' snowblower _ the prized emblem of the Democratic presidential nominee's budget-consciousness _ during one of several appearances in which he continued to criticize <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as weak on defense `` If he does n't want to modernize his snowblower, that's his concern,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Campbell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, referring to the 25-year-old snowblower that figured prominently in a film about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at the Democratic National Convention. `` But if he does n't modernize our weapons systems, that puts the national security of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in considerable risk. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, resurrecting the Iran-Contra arms and money scandal as a campaign issue, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was head of an anti-terrorism task force that had issued a report denouncing any concessions to terrorist nations. `` The president and the vice president and a number of other people, over the opposition of the secretary of state and the secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION>, by the way, proceeded to do precisely what that commission said you should never do,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said at a news conference during a tour of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. `` Making tough decisions is a test of leadership,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> endorsed the decision to sell arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and in doing so he failed that test.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was spending most of today at the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Statehouse before flying to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for three days of campaigning in Western states. His running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was taking the day off hunting in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, officials of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign met with their counterparts in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign to begin negotiations on a debate schedule and format. Both sides reported being far apart. The Republicans say they want two presidential debates and one confrontation between vice presidential contenders, but nothing before Sept. 22. The Democrats want a more extensive schedule.

 Anti-government protesters clashed with police after the military junta nominated President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to rule until 1997. Two people were killed during the demonstrations and more than 800 arrested. At least 21 people were injured in the clashes. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, 72, promised a move toward democracy after being named Tuesday as the only candidate in an Oct. 5 presidential referendum. The right-wing general has run <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> since taking power in a bloody 1973 coup. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> called on his followers `` to fight to achieve victory'' in the presidential plebiscite. Thousands in the capital banged empty pots and pans in protest and demonstrators erected barricades with burning tires and blocked traffic at many intersections Tuesday night in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, a city of 4.5 million residents. Hospital officials said <PERSON> Erickson </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, 15, was killed by unidentified gunmen who fired from a speeding car as he banged a pot from the window of his home in southwestern <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>. Officials at the hospital where <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> was taken said the teen-ager was shot twice in the chest. The spokespeople said three other demonstrators were shot and wounded in similar circumstances and one of them, also a boy, died. Police Capt. <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Sierra </PERSON> said 19 other people were injured and 846 were arrested in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>. Four public buses were set afire and destroyed by demonstrators, and one of the bus drivers was seriously burned, he said. Similar protests occurred Tuesday night in many other cities. Police did not report on casualties or arrests in those cities. But this morning, a duty officer at the <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> police headquarters said without elaborating, `` It's totally calm now.'' The protests began as <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> and the other military commanders met to choose the nominee, and became more violent through the night. Power outages occurred in several suburbs of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> and the northern coastal city of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Serena </LOCATION>. The cause of the blackouts was not known, but the power transmission towers are a favorite target of leftist guerrillas. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> heralded his nomination as `` a decisive moment in the institutional process'' started by his 15-year-old government. The opposition denounced it as the continuation of `` an aging dictatorship.'' `` If I govern, you govern,'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> told thousands of supporters from a balcony of the government palace. He called on them `` to fight to achieve victory'' in the upcoming ballot. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> led the September 1973 coup that ousted the elected government of Marxist President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, who died in the palace takeover. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> has been president of the military government since. If the majority of the 7.2 million registered voters cast `` yes'' ballots for <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, he will start a new term March 11 to last until 1997. If he is rejected, an open election will take place within a year, with <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> remaining in power until then. `` The operetta is over. Gen. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> has imposed his will and is preparing to continue to oppress his people until the end of the century,'' said <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagos </PERSON>, a socialist and co-leader of a 16-party opposition coalition. `` Chileans must decide between an aging dictatorship and renewed democracy,'' <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> said. The centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> party said in a written statement, `` The nomination of Gen. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, with his own vote, is the best denial of the supposed democratic intentions of the regime.'' The nomination was made by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> himself, along with <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> commander Adm. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Toribio </PERSON> <PERSON> Merino </PERSON>; <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> chief Gen. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthei </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> director Gen. <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stange </PERSON>. In his acceptance speech, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said his government is forging a new society in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> with a new type of democracy, protected against `` totalitarianism.'' `` The full democracy that approaches constitutes a new challenge for everyone,'' he said. `` It also will demand of us all overcoming, adapting and rectifying to create a new style of political coexistence.''

<HEAD>Public Schools to Offer Religion or Mandatory Study Hour</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Public school children who do n't want to take daily religion class will have to replace that hour with `` equivalent alternative material,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> has ruled. Tuesday's ruling by the <ORGANIZATION> supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> administrative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> court </ORGANIZATION> that advises the government on prospective legislation reversed a 1987 decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lazio </ORGANIZATION> in which students were given three choices: an hour of religion, an hour of an alternative study or the option not to attend either. Just what subjects might be offered for the `` equivalent alternative'' hour and who would be responsible for teaching them is still undecided. The ruling was criticized for not first legislating national guidelines for the alternative hour. Each school can decide the content of the alternative study. Religious instruction in this overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country was made optional in a 1984 revision of the Concordat, or Italian-Vatican treaty, but there has been no standard formula for how such classes should be scheduled or what to do with students not taking it. The issue developed into a church-state struggle last year. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> pushed for a mandatory alternative class, saying students would be discouraged from attending religious classes if allowed to leave school. `` Lay'' political forces objected, saying it would compromise the optional future of religious instruction. In 1987 more than 90 percent of public school students reportedly had signed up for <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> teaching.

<HEAD>Burma Latest Example of `People Power' Against Authoritarians in
Asia</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Analysis</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It is happening again in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>: masses of people mounting a sustained campaign of demonstration and protest against an authoritarian government. For several weeks it has been <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. A year ago it was <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. In February 1986, `` people power'' in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> ended the 20-year presidency of <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and drove him into exile. Popular protest developed differently in each case, under markedly different circumstances, but brought changes that were breathtaking for all three nations. There were signs that crowds of demonstrators in both <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> drew inspiration from the Philippine example. Some South Korean protesters cited the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> as a model of an Asian nation throwing off oppressive rule without upsetting the entire basis of society or destroying the economy. Foreign tourists emerging from <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> told reporters that many <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION>, repressed for 26 years, found parallels with the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which had close ties with the former regimes in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, says it welcomes more representative government in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. After Burmese authorities lifted martial law last Wednesday and said they would consider holding free elections, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said: `` Certainly we welcome this movement toward democracy.'' <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON>, an assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee in May: `` Politically, progress toward increasingly representative government continues apace in the <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. In short, events in the region have been going our way.'' Nonetheless, anti-American demonstrations have occurred as those who demonstrated against their governments turned to protests of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces stationed in the two countries and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> support for the former leaders. <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials say <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will face more difficult relations with countries whose governments become more democratic. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> followed an isolationist course under the `` Burmese way to socialism'' of Ne Win, who seized power in a coup in 1962. He resigned late in July and students led protests for democracy, economic reform and release of prisoners. Ne Win's successor, <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, jailed dissidents and soldiers shot to kill in an unsuccessful attempt to stop demonstrations by hundreds of thousands of people. <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks joined students in reading pro-democracy proclamations. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> resigned after 17 days, to be replaced by civilian attorney <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, and the turmoil continues. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, professor of Japanese studies at <ORGANIZATION> Sophia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and a widely published commentator on <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> politics, said it was `` encouraging and remarkable that such latent people power existed'' in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. `` We had thought they were a demoralized and docile population, unhappy about governmental inefficiency but tolerating it,'' he said. `` It turned out they had as much guts and bravery as the people in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>.'' The Burmese did not have leaders to provide a focus as, for instance, the Filipinos had in <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. She is the widow of <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who was assassinated when he returned home to oppose <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, and became president when <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> fled. Another difference was that a military revolt against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> coincided with the popular uprising, while the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> military was used against protesters. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, street battles last summer between huge crowds and riot police led to major concessions toward democracy from the military-backed government but did not overthrow it. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>, the outgoing president, accepted opposition demands that included direct presidential elections, greater freedom of speech and release of many political prisoners. Whether the revolt in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> will bring greater democracy is not yet clear, but Asians have shown that great potentional power lies in coordinated mass effort in a region of 3 billion people. <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s most noted proponent of mass action was <PERSON> Mohandas </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. He led vast throngs in demonstrations against British colonial rule in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, which became independent in 1947.

 A jury today impeached Florala Mayor H.T. <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> on charges of neglect of duty and incompetence, removing him from an office he used to publicize `` voodoo'' antics and to pardon scores of drunken drivers. The 85-year-old mayor ran out of the <LOCATION> Covington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> courtroom after the circuit court jury announced its verdict. His attorney, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Prestwood </PERSON>, said he would seek a new trial for the mayor, who testified that he pardoned dozens of convicted offenders because he's `` soft hearted.'' After one hour of deliberation this morning, the jury ruled that <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> should be removed from office because he's incompetent and neglected his duty. The verdict means he was immediately ousted, Circuit Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> said. Prosecution witnesses have depicted <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> as a man who undermined the law by abusing his pardon power during the last four years. He is accused of pardoning more than 100 traffic offenders, including 27 drunken drivers. But <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON>, taking the stand Tuesday to defend his performance in office, said people came to him with sad stories and he was just trying to help them. `` I'm just a little soft hearted,'' the former tire store owner testified. The mayor of <LOCATION> Florala </LOCATION>, a town of about 5,000 on the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> border 20 miles south of <LOCATION> Andalusia </LOCATION>, drew national attention with his July proclamation of `` National Voodoo Week'' and his earlier purported attempt to scare the police chief by sprinkling so-called `` voodoo powder'' around City Hall, council chambers and down corridors to the jail. However, <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> testified that he did not believe in voodoo and the yellow powder he spread at City Hall was sulfur powder not meant to harm anyone physically. After the media reported the incident, the mayor said he decided to capitalize on publicity. `` I do n't even know what voodoo means,'' he testified. `` I made a mistake in the way I did it.'' Before taking the stand Tuesday, he told reporters: `` Satan is trying to destroy <PERSON> Florala </PERSON>'s government. I love Florala.'' <PERSON> Prestwood </PERSON> said during closing arguments on the second day of the trial that it would be cruel to impeach <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON>, whose term ends Oct. 3. `` They've done everything in the book to make H.T. <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> look bad.'' <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> was depicted by prosecution witnesses as a man who undermined the law by abusing his power to pardon drunken drivers. `` I have more power than <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> was quoted as saying by City Clerk <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooten </PERSON>. In the state's closing arguments, Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Valeska </PERSON> said no one in <LOCATION> Florala </LOCATION> expected <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> `` would go power crazy.'' `` For him to have one more hour in office flies in the face of our system of government,'' <PERSON> Valeska </PERSON> said. Later, state Attorney General <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegelman </PERSON> described the situation in <LOCATION> Florala </LOCATION> as `` the most abusive case I've ever heard of in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.''

 A floating crane lifted a crumpled Chinese jetliner from the harbor near <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> airport after the plane skidded off the runway upon landing in a heavy rain Wednesday, killing seven people. The dead were six crew members and a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> passenger who died of his injuries in a hospital. The crew members' bodies were found in the front part of the British-made Trident, which was submerged just off <ORGANIZATION> Kai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>'s only runway, said <PERSON> Tsui </PERSON> <PERSON> Hin-cheuk </PERSON>, divisional fire commander. The jetliner, operated by <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the nation's flag carrier, skidded off the runway in a rainstorm at 9:19 a.m. -LRB- 9:19 p.m. EDT Tuesday -RRB- as it landed on a flight from <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s southern <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> province, about 90 miles to the northwest. Fifteen of the 89 people on board Flight 301 were injured, including two of the 12 American passengers, said the airline, known as <ORGANIZATION> CAAC </ORGANIZATION>. Thirteen people were hospitalized in fair and satisfactory condition. <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong </ORGANIZATION> said that besides the Americans, the injured included three Chinese crew members, seven passengers from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, two from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and a Frenchman. Hospital officials identified one of the injured as <PERSON> Heung </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheuk-Wu </PERSON>, a 38-year-old Chinese-American. `` You know, today the weather is not very good,'' <ORGANIZATION> CAAC </ORGANIZATION> station manager <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhengyou </PERSON> said when asked about the cause of the crash. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> also blamed the weather. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> officials launched an investigation. A <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, which makes the Trident, said the company offered to help. <ORGANIZATION> CAAC </ORGANIZATION> said the pilot was among the dead, and <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> said investigators hoped to retrieve the plane's flight recorder. The rescue operation involved a floating crane, divers, a small flotilla of rescue craft and five air force helicopters. <PERSON> Tsui </PERSON> said one of the engines was on fire when rescue teams arrived. Officials said rescuers saved at least two people who were trapped in the fuselage after the crash. `` There were a few big bumps and there we were, in the water,'' said <PERSON> Willemm </PERSON> <PERSON> Goudswaard </PERSON>, a Dutch survivor. `` When the people realized that the plane was on the water they calmed down very quickly.'' <PERSON> Kiyotaka </PERSON> <PERSON> Fukasawa </PERSON>, a 60-year-old Japanese passenger, told reporters that as soon as the plane hit the water, a flight attendant opened an emergency door so passengers could scramble onto a wing and wait for rescuers. Government-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong </ORGANIZATION> interviewed an unidentified passenger who said some of the plane's seat belts did not work and when the plane `` landed so hard, people simply were flying.'' The crash shut down <PERSON> Kai </PERSON> <PERSON> Tak </PERSON>, a major hub for <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, for more than six hours. It remained open through the night to handle the backlog. <PERSON> Kai </PERSON> <PERSON> Tak </PERSON> is one of the most difficult airports to land in because pilots must maneuver over high-rise buildings on their approach. Its worst accident was in 1967, when a Thai International flight crashed into the harbor and killed 24 of 73 people on board. <ORGANIZATION> CAAC </ORGANIZATION> bought 35 Tridents between 1972 and 1978 from <PERSON> Hawker </PERSON> <PERSON> Siddeley </PERSON>, whose aviation and defense businesses became part of British Aerospace when it was nationalized in 1977. British Aerospace has since been privatized. <ORGANIZATION> CAAC </ORGANIZATION> flies 490 planes on more than 300 domestic and international routes. It reported a record 12.5 million passengers last year.

 Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has come under <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> fire for granting pardons to more than 230 ex-convicts since 1983, but records show he has been tougher on the issue than his <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> predecessors. The <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, in a report released Tuesday, said the governor pardoned 232 people between 1983 and 1987, clearing their records of crimes ranging from manslaughter _ five cases _ to breaking and entering _ 136 cases. Twenty-one of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' pardons _ nearly one out of 10 _ were granted to people convicted of selling or possessing with intent to sell drugs. The council, a non-profit, research organization founded and initially funded by state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamie </PERSON>, claims no ties to the Republican leader. And <PERSON> Bull </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdun </PERSON>, president of the council, said it was not trying to make `` an overall judgment'' about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. But state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> Executive Director <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON> said the report `` is a clear indication that <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a very liberal, left-wing person. He says one thing about being tough on crime and he does another.'' However, figures provided by the governor's statehouse press office show that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has granted fewer pardons than his predecessors. Republican governor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Volpe </PERSON> granted 1,324 pardons between 1965 and 1968, and GOP <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sargent </PERSON> granted 1,755 pardons between 1969 and 1974. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> granted 552 pardons during his first term from 1975 to 1978. He was followed by <PERSON> Democrat-later-to-turn-Republican </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, who granted 211 pardons from 1979 to 1982. Although <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> granted more pardons between 1983 and 1987 than <PERSON> King </PERSON> did during his administration, the number of pardons <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> allowed during a comparable four-year period was actually less _ 192. The 232 pardons granted by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> between 1983 and 1987 came from 550 requests submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pardons </ORGANIZATION>, a committee of the state <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. The full parole board recommended 247 of those be granted, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> rejected 15 of them. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, executive assistant to the state <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said the board considers a pardon `` an extraordinary form of relief.'' `` It is founded on the principle that people ought to be able to put their problems behind them if they have exhibited extended periods of good citizenship and deserve forgiveness by the commonwealth,'' he said. The pardoning process is an extensive one that includes input from the courts, the police and the prosecutors familiar with each applicant. Besides the <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, the governor's legal counsel and the eight-member elected Governor's Council review the applications. While the number of pardons has been decreasing, the number of criminals being sent to state prisons has increased by 40 percent between 1983 and 1987 and the crime rate has dropped 13.4 percent, said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> press aide. In 1983, 2,035 people were sent to state prisons. In 1987, there were 2,853. Of that increase in 818 inmates, 72 percent of them were convicted of drug-related crimes, <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said. `` Very simply there are more people going to jail and there are hard clear increases in the number of drug offenders going to jail,'' <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said. `` And by same token, we are looking at fewer pardons.''

 Family members searched for loved ones missing after an air show crash killed at least 48 people. Injured children lay unclaimed in hospitals as officials tried to determine if their parents were among the dead. Earlier, officials said the death toll was 49. <LOCATION> Rhineland-Palatinate </LOCATION> state spokesman <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dietzen </PERSON> said today a 4-year-old boy in serious condition was erroneously listed as dead. But <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman Maj. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said revised figures showed 52 people were dead. On Tuesday, the Pentagon announced 40 people died, six of them <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens. On Sunday, three of 10 jets in an <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> air force stunt team collided, one careening into the crowd at the annual air show at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base in <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION>. By this evening, 25 of the dead were identified, said <PERSON> Dietzen </PERSON>. He said 166 injured were being treated at hospitals. The identified dead included the three pilots, 20 West Germans, a Dutchman and a Frenchman, he said. <PERSON> Dietzen </PERSON> said no Americans were among the identified dead. But chief <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said six Americans were known to be among those killed. The Italian air force official who coordinated the team's stunts said one plane caused the crash by flying into an intersecting maneuver at the wrong altitude and speed. It was that pilot's jet, having crossed solo through two passing formations, that tumbled into the crowd. A local prosecutor said today he started a probe into the crash as required by West German law, but said it probably would not lead to a criminal trial. <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Sattler </PERSON>, chief prosecutor in the neighboring town of <LOCATION> Kaiserlautern </LOCATION>, said legal restrictions virtually bar bringing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Italian officers before a German court in a criminal trial in a case like the <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION> crash. He also said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has no jurisdiction over the base. The Frankfurter <ORGANIZATION> Allgemeine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeitung </ORGANIZATION> daily newspaper reported today that the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> party filed a criminal complaint against the base commander `` for negligent manslaughter and negligent bodily harm.'' Greens are known for their anti-NATO stance Seven Americans remained hospitalized today in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> hospital in <LOCATION> Landstuhl </LOCATION>, spokeswoman <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said, with an undetermined number at other hospitals. Ms. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> McCanch </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>, and their 2 -LCB- - year-old son, <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, were taken from the hospital today and placed on a flight to <ORGANIZATION> Brooke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Arriving at the center today were Air Force Master Sgt. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Covina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; Army 1st Lt. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Strader </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pfc </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Myron </PERSON> <PERSON> Riggs </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Anderea </PERSON> <PERSON> DelaRosa </PERSON>, 33, an Italian sergeant major. Sgt. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION> base spokesman, said today that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were still not ready to release the names of the dead and injured. Opposition to military air shows mushroomed. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies suspended future air shows as they tried to figure out how to make them safer. Many West Germans _ including some of those injured Sunday _ demanded the shows be banned. `` Now I take warnings about the dangers of air shows seriously. I did n't before,'' said <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Eggenweiler </PERSON> of <PERSON> Rothenberg-am-Neckar </PERSON>, whose back and arms were severely burned and who will likely be scarred for life. `` Now I think these shows should be forbidden,'' he said from his bed at <LOCATION> Kaiserslautern </LOCATION> hospital. In a poll by the respected <ORGANIZATION> Wickert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, 82 percent of the 2,710 West Germans surveyed said they want all military air shows stopped. Only 18 percent said they did not want the shows stopped, the institute said. <PERSON> Dietzen </PERSON> said police received scores of reports of missing people after the crash. `` There are even cases of people from as far away as <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> who have said ` my relative has been on vacation there for three weeks, and we have n't heard a word. Is it possible they were at <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION>?','' he said. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> television showed pictures of a special missing persons bureau set up after the disaster in <LOCATION> Kaiserslautern </LOCATION>. `` I'm looking for my sister,'' said one unidentified German man. `` The whole family did n't come home.'' The West German newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> said authorities searched in vain for the parents of two badly burned girls _ 6-year-old <PERSON> Nadine </PERSON> and 10-year-old <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> _ who were taken to a hospital in <LOCATION> Oggersheim </LOCATION>. One unconscious boy thought to be about 13 also had not been identified, the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> Abendpost newspaper said. Doctors at a hospital in <LOCATION> Offenbach </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> said he was burned over 95 percent of his body. Meanwhile, some criticized rescue operations at the show. `` One eyewitness said that he held one of the injured in his arms for 20 minutes waiting for help,'' the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper said. `` A doctor said the organization of the air show was not prepared for such a catastrophe.'' The newspaper did not identify the sources. <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbig </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Kaiserslautern </LOCATION> hospital, told reporters he felt there were not enough mobile medical teams available at the air show. But the <LOCATION> Rhineland-Palatinate </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> defended the rescue efforts as `` quick, level-headed'' and praised the cooperation between the Americans and Germans.

<HEAD>Toxic Waste Ship Sails Away From Britain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PLYMOUTH, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A ship carrying toxic waste that the government refused to accept for disposal sailed away Wednesday after two days in international waters off <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The destination of the <PERSON> Karin </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>, loaded with 2,100 tons of industrial solvents, was unknown, said a port control official in this southern city. The wastes, which originated in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, were dumped secretly and illegally in <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> and then removed in two shiploads by contractors for Italian authorities. The <PERSON> Karin </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>, which left <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> July 30, was rejected by Spanish and Welsh ports before appearing off <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION> on Monday, said the environmental group Friends of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> also said it would not accept the waste. A second ship, the Deep Sea Carrier, sailed from <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> Aug. 15 carrying 1,000 tons of the solvents reportedly for <LOCATION> Revenna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, which objected strongly to accepting the cargo. It showed up off <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> and was off <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> Wednesday, said the environmental group. The port official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a passing ship tried to contact the West German-owned ship on the radio but received no answer. The Environment Department refused comment. An Italian Embassy official, <PERSON> Enrico </PERSON> <PERSON> Augelli </PERSON>, said, `` Wherever it will go it will be a place where it can be treated in a safe way.'' On Tuesday, Junior Environment Minister <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Bottomley </PERSON> said the waste could not be brought into <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> because it did not meet waste laws. She said the waste was `` essentially an Italian problem.'' Environmentalists said the government had lax standards that attracted the ship to British waters. British law allow waste disposal companies to accept toxic waste from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries for incineration or burial. Throughout the furor, Italian officials maintained their government was not involved and that the Italian national waste firm <PERSON> Ambienti </PERSON> had to decide what to do. Italian authorities designated Ambienti to dispose of the waste left in <LOCATION> Koko </LOCATION> on the banks of the <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The Italian government said it did not have the technology to get rid of the waste. British lawmakers from the opposition Labor and governing Conservative parties called for an investigation, even though the ship left.

A three-judge panel headed by <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge <PERSON> Dov </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> ruled that <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, 68, was `` <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> the Terrible,'' a sadistic guard at the <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> death camp who operated gas chambers that killed 850,000 Jews during World War II. The Ukranian-born retired autoworker was sentenced to death on April 25. <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON>, 53, served for 17 years on the <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> bench before retiring in 1983. The weekly magazine <PERSON> Koteret </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashit </PERSON> said his involvement in the trial would add prestige to the defense. <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON>'s Israeli colleague, <PERSON> Yoram </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheftel </PERSON>, who defended <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> from the start of the trial in February 1987, was widely criticized by Israelis for defending <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON> said he was not worried about public reaction to his decision to defend <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>. `` I'm a lawyer. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s family appealed to me and after lengthy consideration I decided the case was worth defending. Every man deserves to be defended,'' <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON> said in an interview. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, who lived in a <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> suburb before being extradited to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, claimed he was a victim of mistaken identity. The trial aroused strong emotions in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and onlookers clapped and cheered when <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> was given the death penalty.

<HEAD>Official Doesn't Expect Asian Policy Change Under Bush, Dukakis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense policy toward <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> will change very little regardless of who is elected the next president, a senior <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official predicted Wednesday. `` Whether it is President -LRB- George -RRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or President -LRB- <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, policies toward <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> will more or less stay on the same course,'' said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> for international security affairs. He also declared it unlikely the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would end its military presence in either <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> or the Southeast Asian region. Rejecting contentions that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> provides <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> `` a free ride'' on defense burdens, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told a news conference that lingering hostility in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> from World War II provides `` real limits beyond which <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would be well-advised not to go'' in military spending. There may be some `` fine tuning'' of policy, but under a traditional American principle that `` if it ai n't broke, do n't fix it,'' the next <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president would make few if any basic changes, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. This is because `` basically our relationships with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, with <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have been great successes through the last 10 years,'' he said. He also predicted both the current review of the agreement on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and its eventual renegotiation will conclude with a new arrangement because that `` is in the best interest of the Republic of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and in the best interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ...'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he rules out withdrawal of the approximately 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> because their presence has been `` a great success'' in deterring any major outbreak of war since the 1953 Korean armistice.

<HEAD>Hundreds Strike Briefly, Demand Reinstatement of Manager</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Poland, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 250 workers at a regional optical instruments plant went on strike for several hours Wednesday and won the reinstatement of a fired manager, a news agency reported. <PERSON> Isvan </PERSON> <PERSON> Toth </PERSON>, the manager of the Visorama plant in the northern town of <LOCATION> Esztergom </LOCATION>, was dismissed Tuesday, the official <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported without giving any reasons for the decision. It said the <PERSON> Visorama </PERSON> strikers described <PERSON> Toth </PERSON>'s dismissal as `` unfair'' and rejected the newly appointed manager. Defending <PERSON> Toth </PERSON>, the strikers said he fulfilled his duties for four years `` to their satisfaction'' and requested that the <LOCATION> Esztergom </LOCATION> facility be left independent from the financially troubled Granvisus parent company in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>. The report said that after some seven hours of talks with a representative of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> and local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and trade union officials, `` the employees came to an agreement with the -LRB- general -RRB- manager of the parent company, who announced that he restored <PERSON> Istvan </PERSON> <PERSON> Toth </PERSON> to his former managerial post.'' According to <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION>, the representative promised the workers that his office would study the request for independence of their plant from the parent company. Although labor unrest is rare in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, more than 300 workers at a mine in the southern part of the country went on strike for 20 hours on Aug. 25 that represented the first worker challenge to the stringent economic policies of premier <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>. The miners at <LOCATION> Kolmo </LOCATION>, some 100 miles south of <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, had complained that because of a quirk in tax laws introduced at the beginning of this year, workers on sick leave could earn more than those working regularly.

<HEAD>Bush Pledges to Reduce Acid Rain</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, standing on the shore of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>, proclaimed himself a lifelong environmentalist on Wednesday and pledged to reduce acid rain on a `` set timetable.'' `` I will work out the exact amounts and the exact methodology with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a speech that aides said was designed to contrast the vice president's environmental views from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policy. `` But the waiting period for action on acid rain is over ... we must have a clear commitment to emissions reductions on a set timetable,'' he said. The Republican presidential nominee also said he would convene a global conference during his first year in the White House to address the `` greenhouse'' effect. He called for protection of natural wetlands and said he wants to `` insure that zero tolerance is applied not only to those who poison our children's minds with drugs, but to those who poison our water with toxic chemicals.'' After several days of campaigning through the South, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chose a key Midwestern battleground state to open a new front in his campaign for the White House. One aide conceded that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> probably trails Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, which has 20 electoral votes, although Republicans express confidence they will carry the state. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s brief trip blended new campaign proposals in a made-for-television setting near <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>, which has undergone significant cleanup in recent years. The vice president took a brief walk along the lake's sandy shore, and cast a fishing line into the water as he stopped to talk with a family on an outing. `` You ever go for the walleyes?'' asked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, an avid fisherman. For the first time in several days, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made no mention of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. But aides said he would couple his environmental themes with a more aggressive campaign style Thursday with a trip to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, a highly polluted site in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' home state. Nor did <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> mention <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> by name during the day. `` These are <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> policies. This is what I will do when I'm elected president,'' he said when asked whether he was advocating stronger policies than <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has pursued. But aides traveling with the vice president said his commitment on acid rain was drafted with just such an idea in mind. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has come under attack from environmentalists for dragging his feet on solving the acid rain problem during his two-term tenure. Earlier this month, however, the president gave the go-ahead for continuing negotiations toward <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> participation in an international treaty to freeze emissions of nitrogen oxides, a precursor to acid rain. `` On the question of acid rain, the time for study alone has passed,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` We know enough to begin taking steps to limit future damage ... as president, I will ask for a program to cut millions of tons of sulfer dioxide emissions by the year 2,000 and to significantly reduce nitrogen oxide emissions as well.'' The vice president offered no specifics. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said the Superfund has sufficient money to handle cleanup of toxic waste sites and said the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> should move aggressivly against those responsibile for dumping. `` Polluters should pay,'' he said. `` I am an environmentalist, always have been, from my earliest days growing up and then as a congressman ... and I always will be ... that's not inconsistent with being a businessman nor is it with being a conservative.'' The campaign trip was plagued by the latest in a string of aircraft problems when a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet chartered to fly reporters to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> developed problems and was unable to fly. A replacement plane was brought in, but did n't reach <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> until after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had finished his speech. Reporters on board arrived in time to see the vice president pay a visit to the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> State Fair.

<HEAD>Report: Prosecution Against Writers Continues In 29 Countries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLY TUNNEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Persecution against writers continues in at least 29 nations despite notable improvements in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, with an estimated 305 authors imprisoned worldwide, a report said Wednesday. `` In all parts of the world, there are cases of censorship or attempts at censorship,'' said <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> P.E.N. </ORGANIZATION>, the London-based association of writers and literary figures that is meeting in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and issued the report. The report from P.E.N.'s influential `` Writers in Prison'' committee said the number of novelists, poets, playwrights and journalists known to be imprisoned in 1988 was 305, or 35 less than one year ago. `` The decrease is almost entirely explained by the new policy against dissidents in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION>,'' the report said. `` In 1983, 93 Soviet writers and journalists were reported imprisoned, in forced psychiatric confinement or internal exile. Today the corresponding number is 20.'' `` Despite the fact that numbers in prison are diminishing and there are improvements in the treatment of writers in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said conditions worsened in countries such as <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` There is no solution,'' said King, a British novelist and playwright, `` because there is no solution to human wickedness.'' He said the figures may be too low in some cases because information is not available from every country. King said P.E.N. would continue pressing for the release of those denied freedom of expression, in particular <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Vegesack </PERSON>, a publisher in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> and chairman of the `` Writers in Prison'' committee, which includes delegates from 20 nations, visited two of five literary figures in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> jails this week. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Vegesack </PERSON> said the 20-minute visits with journalist <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyon-jang </PERSON> and poet <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nam-ju </PERSON> were moving and emotional. He said P.E.N. plans to ask <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s government to release the two, plus publisher <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-bok </PERSON> and poet <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> San-ha </PERSON>, with whom visits were denied. The Swedish publisher said he did not know enough about a fifth prisoner, journalist <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Pu-kyong </PERSON>, to comment on his case and his committee had not asked to visit <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Vegesack </PERSON> also said P.E.N. would demand that the imprisoned writers be immediately given the rights to write, to read all books readily available in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, and to see their lawyers. The committee examines in detail all cases involving imprisoned writers, journalists and publishers, von <PERSON> Vegesack </PERSON> said. `` The quality of writing is not a factor,'' he said. `` The committee deals with whoever gets in jail trying to express opinion. P.E.N. is an apolitical organization, but we believe it's not a crime to have political opinions. P.E.N. does not support those arrested for criminal or violent activities, he added. Controversy has surrounded the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> meeting because it's unusual to hold a P.E.N congress in a country where writers are in prison. The last time that occurred was 1979 in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. The East German delegation boycotted the meeting. Some Korean writers also have boycotted the meeting, saying they would not attend until their colleagues were released from jail. `` Many members think it's not nice to go to banquets when there are colleagues in prison,'' <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Vegesack </PERSON> said. The `` Writers in Prison'' committee was even approached, he said, by representatives from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> `` who wanted to give us information not about the situation in their own country, but about the situation in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.'' He said the committee ignored the overture.

 The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> schools chief said 38 elementary schools tampered with answers on the annual state standarized test, considered the top indicator of a school's performance, according to a published report School chief <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Honig </PERSON> said he does n't know who is to blame, but that letters were sent to district superintendents telling them of schools with `` questionable erasures and responses,'' the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. `` It's up to them to take disciplinary action,'' said <PERSON> Honig </PERSON>, the state superintendent of public instruction. `` Our job is to give them the information.'' <PERSON> Honig </PERSON> said a teacher or principal who cheats `` should get canned.'' The offending schools' scores were dropped from records of the 1985-86 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Assessment Program. The state's 4,600 elementary schools gave the multiple choices tests on math, reading and writing. The tampering was found when a computer identified 120 schools with a statistically high number of eraser marks on test booklets. State officials then went over each book and found that 38 schools had an unusually high number of wrong answers erased and corrected. `` When you had a high number of incorrects going to corrects, something was fishy,'' <PERSON> Honig </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Republican vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has received more negative coverage than any national candidate except <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, according to a study of network evening news programs released Wednesday. Researchers from the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> broadcast 93 stories on the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator from Aug. 16, when he was selected, to Aug. 28. The following night there were no stories on him. The cumulative airtime was three hours and 22 minutes _ `` more than one-quarter of all evening news broadcasts for nearly two weeks after his nomination,'' said the researchers. Evaluations of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> by reporters and non-partisan analysts were positive only 33 percent of the time, according to the study. The researchers called that ratio `` worse than any candidate received during the primaries aside from <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s 21 percent positive rating.'' By contrast, they said, Republican presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had a 49 percent positive rating during the primary season and his Democratic counterpart, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, had a 58 percent rating. The latest study showed that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s service in the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> was the most common topic, appearing in 50 of the 93 evening news stories. His background of privilege dominated 19 stories, his relationship to lobbyist <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> arose in 13 stories and his good looks came up in 10 stories. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was called a conservative 24 times in 12 days, the researchers reported. All the Republican primary candidates combined were called conservative only 27 times during 18 months of campaigning, they said. The non-partisan, non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, directed by social scientists <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON>, has been analyzing evening news coverage since the start of the primary season.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday called on the Chilean government to create conditions to ensure that the national plebiscite set for Oct. 5 is carried out peacefully. Deputy spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said Chilean authorities must `` create an atmosphere in which citizens can exercise their freedom of choice without fear or intimidation so that <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> can take its rightful place in the community of democratic nations.'' The statement came a day after <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s military commanders nominated President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> as the only candidate in a presidential referendum. He will remain as president until 1997 if he receives majority support but an open election will take place within a year if the voters reject him. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> urged the Chilean government to take additional steps to ensure that both sides in the upcoming plebiscite have equal access to the media. She said a new law authorizing free television time to opposing views improves conditions for a free and fair plebiscite. `` The government of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> and especially its armed forces have an important responsibility to assure its citizens that there will be a free plebiscite under peaceful conditions,'' she said.

<HEAD>Newspaper says Hero Worker's Life Ruined by Soviet Leaders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and his successor, <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, drove the nation's showcase hard worker to drink and ruined his family by promoting him to paper-shuffling jobs, a newspaper reported Wednesday. <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Stakhanov </PERSON> was quickly ignored after his record-breaking coal mining feat in the 1930s that made him a hero worker, the labor newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Trud </ORGANIZATION> said. `` <PERSON> Stakhanov </PERSON> was thrown out and forgotten,'' <PERSON> Trud </PERSON> said. `` That is how short the administrative-command -LRB- system's -RRB- memory turned out to be. The Stalinist system needed a symbol, a poster, and not a living person.'' <PERSON> Stakhanov </PERSON> became a legend in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for setting a world production record for coal. On Aug. 31, 1935, he drilled 102 tons of coal in six hours, 14 times the norm for one shift. Western historians say the feat, performed at a <LOCATION> Donetsk </LOCATION> basin mine, was contrived. They say all other work was stopped in <PERSON> Stakhanov </PERSON>'s section of the mine and that a whole gang performed auxiliary work that normally had to be done by the man at the coal face. This explanation has not been reported in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> media, apparently so as not to diminish the value of the feat. The achievement started a nationwide `` speed-up'' movement in which workers, nicknamed `` Stakhanovites,'' competed for bonuses and privileges by setting fantastic output records. Wednesday's article represented another attempt under Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, or openness, to recount history more accurately. It also was another blow to <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, who is widely criticized in the official media now for developing a `` cult of personality,'' killing millions of people including loyal <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members in bloody purges, and overcentralizing the Soviet economy. Like other Soviet leaders recalling the hard-working spirit of <PERSON> Stakhanov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has stressed the need to increase productivity. But _ in addition to working harder _ he has promised people a program of improved technology and accompanied the calls for higher quantity production with a drive for better quality goods. <PERSON> Stakhanov </PERSON> received many awards, a better apartment and was wined and dined by Soviet officials including <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. He did not, however, fare well in the long term, <PERSON> Trud </PERSON> said. The newspaper said that in 1936, <PERSON> Stakhanov </PERSON> was torn away from his favorite work and brought to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to become a bureaucrat. He was made section chief of socialist competitions and awards. `` For 25 whole years after that, his name disappeared from newspaper and magazine pages, from documentary films. His voice was n't heard from a speaker's stand,'' <PERSON> Trud </PERSON> said. The new job turned <PERSON> Stakhanov </PERSON> into an alcoholic, the newspaper said. `` He did n't do anything in particular. With the strong hands that were created for a man's real work, he was shuffling paper and in the evening not infrequently poured himself vodka of bitterness,'' Trud said. His lot did not improve under <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, who came to power in 1953. When a foreign visitor asked the Soviet leader in 1957 what had become of <PERSON> Stakhanov </PERSON>, he said the hero worker was still in <LOCATION> Donbass </LOCATION>, the area where he set the production record, according to Trud. But <PERSON> Stakhanov </PERSON> actually was in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, and when <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> learned of this later, he had the miner sent back to the region. <PERSON> Stakhanov </PERSON> only had 24 hours' notice of the move and left his wife and children behind in the capital. Local officials ignored him. He died a lonely and depressed man in 1977, <PERSON> Trud </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stakhanov </PERSON> still serves as an example for Soviet workers, Trud said, and for that `` will remain in the people's memory as an outstanding worker and patriot.''

 Residents voted at an emotional town meeting to recommend that a modern-style house erroneously constructed in the town's historic district be allowed to stand. A crowd of more than 300 spilled out of the <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> into the parking lot Tuesday night in the town meeting called to try to resolve the dispute. `` It's not just an issue of technicalities,'' said <PERSON> Winofred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wingate </PERSON>, one of the community's 1,500 residents. `` It's an issue of the quality and the spirit of how we deal with these issues.'' <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> and <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Sallah </PERSON> were granted a building permit for a round, two-story redwood house, because the map used by town officials erroneously indicated their lot was outside the historic district. Within the district, new buildings are supposed to follow traditional <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> style. A second house was also approved erroneously, but its architecture is not so unconventional. Town officials propose that the house, a ranch-style building, would fit in if it is covered in wood shingles. Residents approved one proposal Tuesday by a voice vote to have the Sallahs ask the town zoning board for a variance, with the board taking note that public sentiment favors approval. <PERSON> Sallah </PERSON> said later he would be willing to make such a request. But the zoning board has already turned down the couple's request for an exemption. By a vote of 177-114, residents also voted Tuesday to recommend a referendum on the November ballot to redraw the boundaries of the historic district to exclude the Sallahs' house, the ranch-style house and one other nearby house. But many residents argued that changing the historic district would set a bad precedent. `` I am unwilling to pay the price of scrapping our zoning ordinance, which we have protected for 18 years, as a solution to Mr. <PERSON> Sallah </PERSON>'s problem,'' said <PERSON> Sabin </PERSON> <PERSON> Guertin </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION> resident for 65 years. The Sallahs have taken the issue to <ORGANIZATION> Merrimack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and have stopped work on the house, which is enclosed but not finished inside. The owners of the ranch-style home also are appealing the zoning board's requirement that they put shingles on the house.

<TEXT>
 The warring Moslem and Christian communities of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> proposed contradictory solutions Wednesday to the 13-year-old conflict that has claimed 130,000 lives. Justice Minister <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, head of the Syrian-backed mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> movement, called for an end to the `` First Republic'' that has given Maronite Catholics dominance over <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since independence was gained from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> 45 years ago. `` I hereby declare the end of the <LOCATION> First </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by burying the system of the 1943 covenant and the creation of the Second Lebanese Republic based on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Arab calling, sovereignty, independence and justice,'' <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> was referring to an unwritten covenant under which the Maronites controlled the presidency, the army, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and the judiciary. The charter gave the Shiites the post of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker and the Sunni Moslems the prime minister's portfolio. <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> threatened that Syrian-backed Moslem and leftist factions would not permit presidential elections if the demanded reforms were not accepted before Sept. 23, when the six-year term of President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> expires. But <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON>, commander of the right-wing Christian Lebanese forces militia, rejected <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>'s proposals. `` We are ready, after the presidential elections, to meet with all the Lebanese factions anywhere in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to discuss ` entente.' Presidential elections should be held first,'' <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON> said. Entente, in Lebanese political parlance, refers to a formula of coexistence accepted by the various warring factions. Parliament failed Aug. 18 to muster a quorum to elect a president to succeed <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> when only 38 deputies showed up at <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The only serious candidate was Syrian-backed former President <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON>. Moslem and leftist factions accused the Lebanese Forces of preventing parliamentary deputies from taking part in the session, in order to block the election of <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON>, a personal friend of Syrian President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>. <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON>, 78, holds <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON> responsible for the June 1978 killing of his elder son, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>; <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>'s wife; and 3-year-old daughter, along with 30 followers in a raid on the family's summer mansion in the northern town of <LOCATION> Ehden </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gegea </PERSON> made his remark at a news conference in <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> addressed a mass rally in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the disappearance of the Shiites' religious leader in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, Imam <PERSON> Moussa </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadr </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Sadr </LOCATION>, who founded <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> in 1974 and headed the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, disappeared Aug. 31, 1978, during a visit to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> jetliner carrying more than 100 people crashed and burned on takeoff today at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, killing at least nine and injuring more than 30, officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 en route to <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> went down in hazy sunshine, broke in two and burst into flames on a flat, grassy field near the runway. Many passengers climbed to safety through a blackened hole in the top of the cabin. Passengers on another flight who watched in horror as the plane tipped to one side and went down chanted `` Get up! Get up!,'' a witness said. `` There was pandemonium. People were jumping on the plane's wing and burning themselves on it because it was so red hot,'' said a survivor, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammack </PERSON>. `` We got out of the way fast because we thought it was going to explode.'' `` You could see the fuel running down the window and down the wing, and I was n't going to get burned,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said at least nine people were killed and that about 60 survivors were healthy enough to continue on their way. The three pilots survived, although one suffered a severe back injury, he said. At least 32 people were admitted to seven hospitals, hospital officials said, but their condition was not immediately known. Other passengers were treated and released. Most of the injured suffered burns, cuts or broken bones. `` The plane had slid sideways about the last 100 yards on the ground. It was n't a violent crash. It was n't cartwheeling or anything like that,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeks </PERSON>, who works for an airport shuttle bus service and talked to some of the injured. `` They had no idea what happened,'' Weeks said. The fire was brought under control quickly, but the partially blackened, split-open fuselage smoldered more than an hour after the 9:03 a.m. accident. Flight 1141, which originated in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, carried more than 97 passengers and seven crew members, but the exact number was not known because infants are not on passenger lists, <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said. `` The important thing is that the airplane was 1,000 feet from the end of the runway,'' <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said. `` This had to aid rescue efforts.'' <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> earlier reported 15 and then 11. He said those figures were based on erroneous reports from hospital officials and people at the scene. Investigators had no immediate indication of the cause of the crash, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. However, a source involved in the federal investigation said early indications were that the jet took an unusually long time to become airborne, that it climbed to only about 80 feet, and that the left wing struck the runway first. The source spoke on condition of anonymity. An <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> team of investigators was sent to the scene. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 is one of the most popular commercial jetliners ever made, flown by more than 170 carriers. <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> <PERSON> Waugh </PERSON>, an uninjured passenger, said the plane `` never got in the air.'' `` I heard a noise _ I knew something was wrong,'' <PERSON> Waugh </PERSON> said. Within a minute, the plane was in flames, he said. The plane broke in two, and passengers began scrambling through the roof, he said. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnett </PERSON>, an attorney from <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, said he was on a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> flight that had just landed when the plane went down. `` It was tipping as it was taking off. It was already tipping to the right and then, as it crossed in front of us, it never was able to get altitude,'' he said. `` A lot of people on the left side of our plane we're saying, ` Get up, get up' when they saw it coming right in front of us.'' <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said he saw the plane from his window before it crashed. `` I noticed the tail was sort of hanging down, like, you know, it should n't have been,'' he said. `` And then I saw red sparks starting at the back of the tail, and I thought that's not its light, that's a fire. Then I watched it put its tail into the ground and exploded in a huge ball of fire.'' Ambulances took injured from the site, and fire trucks sprayed foam on the wreckage. Rescue teams in asbestos suits walked through the wreckage, looking for passengers and spraying water on sections still aflame. Ambulances drove onto and off the field where the jet crashed. Several helicopters also flew in and out. The accident is the second at <ORGANIZATION> DFW </ORGANIZATION> involving <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> in three years. On Aug. 2, 1985, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Flight 191 crashed as it approached a runway during a violent thunderstorm, killing 137 people, including a motorist. The crash injured 25 others. The L-1011 jet was on a flight from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. Investigators determined that there was a wind shear, a violent change in wind direction that can rob a plane of lift On May 24, a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 of the Costa Rican airline <ORGANIZATION> LACSA </ORGANIZATION> exploded in flames on takeoff from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. No one was seriously injured.

 A federal law guaranteeing customers of banks, savings associations and credit unions timely access to money they deposit by check takes effect Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed the Expedited Funds Availability Act last year after consumer groups complained that Americans were losing millions of dollars a year in lost interest and unjustified overdraft charges because some financial institutions were putting holds as long as two weeks on funds deposited by check. However, bankers say most institutions were voluntarily meeting deadlines for making funds available. They complain the new rules are confusing and costly to implement and will make it more difficult to detect phony or rubber checks. Here are some of the key provisions of <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> regulations that implement the law: _ Local checks written on a financial institution in the same metropolitan area or within the same <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> check-processing region must be available within three business days _ Funds on non-local checks can be held for as many as seven days after deposit _ Funds from cashier's checks, certified checks and government checks must be made available for withdrawal by 9 a.m. on the next business day after deposit _ Checks deposited through automatic-teller machines after 2 p.m. will not be considered received until the next business day _ By Sept. 1, 1990, the hold period will shrink to two days for local checks and five days for non-local checks

<TEXT>
 The blind trust of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> invested about $ 564,000 _ more than twice the amount previously disclosed _ in a holding company that was formed by his son last year but has conducted little business since then, a published report said Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> also reported that the company has been paying the financially strapped <PERSON> Lan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> nearly $ 10,000 a month for his services as president and board chairman, according to a record of his testimony in an Aug. 3 divorce hearing. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator, denied Tuesday that he influenced the investment decision and said he saw nothing unusual about the transaction. He acknowledged, however, that trust administrators probably based their decision on what he would have done in the same circumstances. `` I do n't consider it unusual to consider how a father would feel about the investment in his son's buisness,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` I consider it an investment in my son's future.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> said Wednesday that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> talked with the newspaper `` and expressed his views, so I would n't have any comment in addition to what Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said to the Post yesterday. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who is vacationing in rural <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, was unavailable for comment. Senate records show the investment originated as a personal loan <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> made to his son in October 1986 for between $ 100,000 to $ 250,000. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> transferred the note receiveable to his trust in August 1987.

<HEAD>Study Says One in Three Americans Inherit Colon Cancer Gene</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A gene inherited by a third of all white Americans may be responsible for most cancer of the colon and rectum, and a search is on to pinpoint this inborn cancer trigger, researchers say. The study, to be published Thursday, suggests one gene _ or perhaps several _ that are present at birth put some people at high risk of developing adenomatous polyps. Colon and rectal cancers develop from these growths. Researchers who conducted the work at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> say they believe the still-unidentified genetic factor accounts for 50 percent to 100 percent of all cancer of the colon and rectum, which strikes an estimated 147,000 Americans annually. `` This paper is of particular importance, because it points to the fact that a single gene may underlie a significant portion of all cases of colon cancer,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Swift </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>. `` It gives, in principle, a way of getting to that gene and identifying it.'' Dr. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burt </PERSON>, a co-author of the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> study, said that locating the gene is one of his team's goals. `` We think we have a fairly good chance of one day finding the gene or genes,'' he said. Until now, many experts believed that inheritance played only a minor role in colon cancer. However, inheriting the gene does not mean that one is destined to have cancer. Other studies have shown that only about 5 percent of adenomatous polyps go on to become cancerous. The researchers believe other genetic factors or diet may play a role in turning the polyps cancerous in people who inherit the gene. `` We are not saying that genes are the only thing that are responsible for this, but only particular individuals who have inherited the susceptibility are at increased risk,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon-Albright </PERSON>, the study's principle author. `` Then other factors, such as diet, act upon those people to transform polyps into colo-rectal cancer.'' In another report published with the study in the New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogelstein </PERSON> and others from <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> say that a series of four or five genetic mutations and deletions are necessary for colon or rectal cancer to occur. Just how the two discoveries fit together is still unclear, but <PERSON> Vogelstein </PERSON> said they do n't necessarily contradict each other. `` It would suggest that for some reasons, members of those families who have colon cancer have a higher tendency to mutate one of these genes, or they already have inherited a mutated copy,'' <PERSON> Vogelstein </PERSON> said in an interview. `` If it takes four or five steps to get cancer, and they have already inherited one of them, that would explain why they get cancer more frequently, because they already have a head start.'' The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> recommends that people over age 50 have stool tests annually for signs of cancer, and they should have proctosignoidoscopy _ examination of the colon with a lighted tube _ every three to five years. Dr. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnipper </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Beth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said that as a result of the newest findings, those exams should probably start at age 40 in people who have relatives with colon or rectal cancer. He said the new study suggests that `` there may well be people at considerably greater risk than others. We should focus our attention on getting relatives of colon cancer patients into the doctor's office for screening.'' Based on colon exams of 670 people in 34 families, the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> team concluded that 32 percent of all white Americans inherit one or two copies of a dominant gene that makes them susceptible polyps. There is a 63 percent chance that people with the gene will get polyps by age 80. They did not estimate the chance that people who carry the gene will actually get colon or rectal cancer. The 34 families were selected randomly from <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> families in which colon or rectal cancer or polyps had been diagnosed. Researchers said the sample had a disproportionate number of Mormons, who make up roughly half the state's population, but that the results would apply to white Americans in general.

 The government threatened protesters who have occupied government buildings, and striking public employees planned a huge march Thursday against 26 years of authoritarian rule. Organizers said four columns of demonstrators marching from different areas would converge on Bandoola Gardens, <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>'s largest park, for a rally Employees of more than 120 government departments and state-owned corporations formed the <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. It was the fourth illegal association created in three days. Students and dock workers have formed illegal unions and 21 elder statesmen created a <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> led by <PERSON> Win </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, 72, who was president in Prime Minister U Nu's government. U Nu, 81, was the man ousted in the 1962 military coup that ended <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> democracy. He has been named `` patron'' of the group. <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> radio broadcast an official statement that said the government has allowed peaceful assembly and marches, but added: `` In some towns, <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- local government -RRB- offices and other government buildings are illegally occupied by the people. Illegal occupants must vacate the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> offices and government buildings immediately or face the consequences.'' It did not describe the consequences. The statement was signed by <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Ko </PERSON>, secretary to the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION>, as the Cabinet is called. President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s government has said a special session of the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's only legal political group, will be held Sept. 12 to consider holding a referendum on one-party rule. Protesters from all segments of <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> society have rejected that and demand formation of an interim government to bring back democracy. A general strike has paralyzed <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> and other cities. Protesters apparently have taken over the local adminsitrations of <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> in southernmost <LOCATION> Mergui </LOCATION> state and some other towns. Local adminstrations _ the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Councils </ORGANIZATION> _ and officers of the ruling party have resigned in some areas, with security and other duties being taken up by residents and <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks. One Burmese analyst described the situation as anarchic. He said Wednesday that people live in daily fear and suspense amid rumors of bombings, arson, looting and impending coups. Turmoil began when <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON> resigned July 23, after imposing more than a quarter-century of isolation and economic ruin after the coup. He was succeeded by <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, a hardliner held responsible for bloody repression of previous protests. Soldiers shot into crowds of demonstrators and at least 112 people were killed in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> alone, according to official figures. Unofficial estimates put the number at several times that. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, a civilian lawyer, replaced <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> after 17 days and the violence abated, but protests continued. <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> radio said more than 1,500 prisoners were released Tuesday and Wednesday from Insein jail in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> and a prison at <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. That brings to about 8,700 the number reported freed from the two jails. Riots were reported last week at those and five other jails, where smaller numbers of prisoners have been released. The official radio urged striking workers to resume their jobs at the nation's two oil refineries, at <LOCATION> Syriam </LOCATION> 10 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> in central <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. `` As petrol and diesel oil can not be refined and sold, transportation of commodities by car and rail and commuter transport services will no longer be possible,'' it said. `` Hence the working people will have to bear the high cost of goods.'' Officials accompanied by soldiers began house-to-house searches Tuesday for engineers of the Syriam refinery to force them back to work, but an engineer told the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday none had been found. He said he and his colleagues were in hiding and would continue the strike until an interim government was formed. About 150 refinery engineers, technicians and chemists are on strike, he said. Sources said more than 5,000 employees of the Syriam refinery, led by the plant manager, marched in the town Sunday shouting anti-government slogans. Workers at <LOCATION> Syriam </LOCATION>, which had produced 26,000 barrels of petroleum products a day, walked out in mid-August when student protesters called for a nationwide general strike. Military engineers tried unsuccessfully to operate the plant.

The budget for the five-month program was $ 800,000, he said. Customers may still use the toll-free line, 1-800-US-BONDS, to listen to a recording with rate and other information on the bonds.

 At first blush, it sounds like a pretty good deal. If you do n't mow your lawn in <LOCATION> Hempstead </LOCATION>, the town will do it for you. Ah, but there are strings attached to the new lawn law, which was approved by town supervisors Tuesday. For starters, the town will charge errant landowners a fee for municipal mowing. And town officials have the right to tack on a $ 250 fine and throw the offender in jail. The fee has n't been determined. The beautification law, which goes into effect this fall, specifies that the town will cut any lawn in which the grass is more than 8 inches high. It also empowers the town to remove abandoned vehicles from private property. Officials wo n't prowl through neighborhoods with tape measures, said Presiding Supervisor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondello </PERSON>. But action will be taken against people whose neighbors complain enough, or whose lawn is obviously high enough to be unsightly, he said.

<TEXT>
 A high school senior who hit `` rock bottom'' in jail as a gang member went from the streets to student council president but faces a legal battle to keep playing football in hopes of winning a college scholarship. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON>, 19, is a former street-gang member from <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> and is now a `` B'' student at <ORGANIZATION> Yorkville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in this affluent western <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb. His family moved in 1986 to <LOCATION> Yorkville </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON>, the only black at the school of 640, is now the student council president and a star running back for the Fighting Foxes, gaining more than 700 yards last year. <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> is fighting an <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> regulation that says he is too old to play organized high school sports. Attorneys for <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> filed a lawsuit Aug. 22 challenging the association's refusal to grant him an exemption from the rule. <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> turned 19 July 10 and the rule says he is ineligible because his 19th birthday was before Aug. 15. `` If I did n't play, it would probably hurt my chances of getting a scholarship, which would be my ticket'' to a college education, <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> said Wednesday in a telephone interview. `` When I was in jail, I realized I was at rock bottom and the only way I have to go is up,'' he said, adding he wants to become a criminal lawyer. <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> spent 2 -LCB- months in the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> View </LOCATION> in 1985 because of gang activities in <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Kendall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> issued a temporary restraining order Tuesday that permits <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> to play in <LOCATION> Yorkville </LOCATION>'s Friday night opener, and five more of the team's nine regular-season games. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> scheduled an Oct. 12 court date to hear further arguments from the high school association. `` We think that <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> is a fine young man, but he is in clear violation of the rules,'' said <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Plaza </PERSON>, an attorney representing the association. Plaza said the association is disappointed with the ruling because <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> is `` one person now being given an exception that no one else is being given.'' <LOCATION> Yorkville </LOCATION> officials had requested the exemption under a recently adopted association bylaw governing hardships, saying <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> was unable to play organized high school sports during what would have been his freshman year in 1985, when he was jailed as a gang member. The association denied the school's request, saying its bylaw extends only to cases where hardships occur beyond the control of the student, family or school. Yorkville Principal <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Babich </PERSON> said <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> has overcome all obstacles so far _ including being the only black student in the school's history _ and should be allowed to play. `` We felt here was a young guy who was able to redirect his life from a negative to a positive,'' <PERSON> Babich </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Babich </PERSON>, who once taught at <ORGANIZATION> Aurora </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said many students in that area get involved with gangs to gain a sense of identity, and often steal and vandalize to get attention. `` When <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> came to us, the only problems we had with him were his academics and general schooling,'' <PERSON> Babich </PERSON> said. `` He just was n't used to going to school.'' <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> has his loftier goals, but there's another reason for his court fight. `` I would like to play football, and that's about it,'' he said.

On Labor Day we recognize these achievements and reflect on the meaning and dignity of work and on the values it protects and strengthens _ the values we as a nation hold most dear. In both peacetime and time of war, American workers have always offered each other and the world their very best, affirming their liberty as individuals and as members of a team and promoting the ideals of free enterprise and democracy here and around the globe. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s workers continue to display the spirit, ingenuity and adaptability to new conditions that labor and employers alike need if our economy is to continue to grow.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> sent fighter planes to the northern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION> to support government forces, but this did not violate the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> peace agreement, a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> spokesman said Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said fighter aircraft based on Soviet territory were dispatched to <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION>, but declined to provide details of the type of planes or of the operations. In another development, Afghan Foreign Minister <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> proposed meeting with his counterparts from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for new efforts to bring peace to his country, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said this week that the Soviets had directed aircraft into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and moved some <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops into <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION> from elsewhere within the country. She said this violated the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords. At a news briefing, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> denied this charge and another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allegation that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> had sent ground troops back to <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION>, about 30 miles from the Soviet border, after withdrawing them recently. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said Soviet aircraft had to be sent in to help Afghan forces repel rebels fighting trying to overthrow <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s Marxist government. `` When the Soviet troops left and part of the troops were still there, counterrevolutionary, anti-governmental gangs began to operate, so countermeasures were required,'' he said. Asked whether the Afghan government requested the assistance, or whether the Soviets volunteered it, the spokesman said: `` When in the area around <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION>, a critical situation emerged, then with the consent of the Afghan government, aircraft were used from Soviet territory for rendering urgent support including a Soviet unit fighting counter-revolutionary formations.'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> reinterated the Soviet complaints against <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and also lashed out at the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Nothing of this kind would have happened had <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, with the support of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, not supplied arms to the rebels, including advisers,'' he said. <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> said in a letter that <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> should also participate in the talks, according to the official news agency. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> oversaw indirect peace talks between <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> that culminated in April with the signing of an international agreement aimed at ending the 9-year-old Afghan civil war and Soviet involvement in it. <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> said the foreign ministers' meeting could be arranged with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general's help `` as soon as possible'' to review compliance with the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Letters proposing the session were sent to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and the countries invited. The message repeated Soviet and Afghan charges that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is violating the agreement by interfering in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s affairs, and noted that 73 complaints about this have been filed with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has rebel bases and helps funnel U.S.-supplied arms to the insurgents. The Afghan government is hoping a leadership change in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> will mean more cooperation in peace efforts. `` We hope that the new Pakistani government, realizing the need for an above-board approach to the international agreements signed by the country, will take steps toward improving relations between the two neighboring Moslem states and normalizing the situation in the region as a whole,'' <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>, a strong backer of the rebels, was killed in a plane crash Aug. 17.

 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s message on the Jewish High Holy Days, which the White House released Wednesday: `` With reverence, awe and joy, Jewish people around the globe observe <LOCATION> Rosh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hashanah </LOCATION>, or the Day of Judgment, and Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. On <PERSON> Rosh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashanah </PERSON>, the Almighty judges the actions of mankind, and because it is the world's birthday, he takes stock of his creations. Yom Kippur is a time for reflection and introspection. During these High Holy Days, Jews focus their prayers on their individual deeds and the need for repentance _ and on the well-being of their brethren and of all humanity. The liturgy of these special days portrays the Almighty as both a stern judge and a compassionate father. Those who observe these Holy Days seek renewed strength and forgiveness for their shortcomings. The Jewish New Year is also a happy time of rebirth and optimism, a time to look to the future with high hopes and high expectation. This past year has seen limited but nevertheless positive steps on the issue of human rights in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and I hope progress will continue and accelerate as the new year of 5749 unfolds. I will continue to press for the release of all refuseniks, for full freedom of emigration and for basic rights of religious and cultural expression. We can not be satisfied with less. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> joins me in extending warm greetings to Jewish people here and abroad, and in once again saying, <PERSON> L'Shahah </PERSON> <PERSON> Tova </PERSON> _ may you be inscribed in the Book of Life for a good year. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.''

<HEAD>Library of Congress Gets Large Gift of Original Music Manuscripts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it has received a major gift of several thousand documents written by composers, musicians and literary figures dating to the 12th century, including hand-written musical scores by <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chopin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mendelssohn </PERSON>. The library said the bequest from <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Moldenhauer </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, pianist, teacher and musicologist who died last October, was the greatest composite gift in the history of its music division, whose collection already contained more than 8 million items. The bequest, received in July, represents the overwhelming bulk of the Moldenhauer collection, which the library described as `` one of the greatest archives of musical primary source materials ever assembled.'' The inventory of more than 400 pages lists several thousand music manuscripts, letters and documents. The oldest apparently is 18 lines of Latin text on vellum, with musical notations, from a 12th century German prayer book. Among the many composers represented in the collection is a copy in <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s handwriting of music from <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>'s opera, `` <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON>,'' probably written as studies for portions of <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s only opera, `` Fidelio.'' Also included are handwritten scores of <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> Chopin </PERSON>'s Prelude for Piano in A flat; <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Franck </PERSON>'s Prelude, Choral and Fugue for solo piano; the sextet from <PERSON> Giacomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Puccini </PERSON>'s opera, `` La Boheme;'' <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendelssohn </PERSON>'s arrangement of the unpublished overture to `` Elijah'' for two pianos; and a major section of the coronation scene from <PERSON> Nicolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Rimsky-Korsakoff </PERSON>'s arrangement of the <LOCATION> Mussorgsky </LOCATION> opera, `` <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Godunov </PERSON>. In the collection is a letter written by English composer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> Handel </PERSON> describing specifications for an organ to be built for the restored home of his collaborator, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennens </PERSON>. It was described as one of the very few <ORGANIZATION> Handel </ORGANIZATION> letters that discusses musical matters. The <PERSON> Moldenhauer </PERSON> archives were established at the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year with several gifts which were supplemented earlier this year by major manuscripts of <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Brahms </PERSON> that were acquired from <PERSON> Moldenhauer </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. The combined collection includes many important documents from composers <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoenberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Webern </PERSON>, the library said, including an unpublished <PERSON> Schoenberg </PERSON> composition that will be played for the first time at the library's Coolidge Auditorium. The <ORGANIZATION> Moldenhauer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, established by the German immigrant who arrived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1938, will finance the library's publication of an illustrated history of Western music based primarily on the <PERSON> Moldenhauer </PERSON> collection.

<HEAD>Dukakis: Bush An Election-Year Convert On Environment; Demands
Iran-Contra Answers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> demanded anew on Wednesday that Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> detail his role in the Iran-Contra scandal, which he called `` one of the greatest foreign policy mistakes in history.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also attacked the Reagan-Bush environmental record a day before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was to venture behind enemy lines for a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> tour designed to showcase <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' greatest environmental embarrassment. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for not moving earlier to clean up the harbor, the nation's filthiest, but the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said he was not to blame and that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> had contributed to the delay in getting the project started. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> scoffed at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s pledge Wednesday to combat acid rain with a new program. `` Talk about an election year convert,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. He noted money cut from federal environmental cleanup programs and said, `` He wants to spend it on Star Wars,' the space defense proposal. The Democratic nominee, meeting with reporters before flying to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to begin a three-day campaign trip, blasted the administration for cutting funding for the Clean Water Act, some of which could have been used for the harbor cleanup, and for not acting promptly on the state's request for a waiver to federal sewage treatment guidelines. When the waiver request was rejected, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> began the multi-billion dollar cleanup. `` We are doing it, no thanks to Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or the administration,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign aides told a morning strategy briefing that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would make questions about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s judgment a central theme of his campaign. To that end, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> used the meeting with reporters to denounce <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s role in the arms-for-hostages deal with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for the second consecutive day. `` He refused to explain his role in this, one of the greatest foreign policy mistakes in history,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` The vice president supported the decision ... The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people would like to know the answer to a continuing question: Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, you sat through five meetings, five meetings on the subject. How can you say now that you did not know that know that it was a straight arms-for-hostages deal.'' Joining <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at the news conference was <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, the co-author of a new book on the Iran-Contra affair, `` Men of Zeal,'' and a member of the congressional committee that investigated the arms deal. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said the hearing records and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s public statements showed that the vice president endorsed the trading of weapons for American hostages held by pro-Iranian factions. The Democratic senator, who later attended a separate news conference to denounce the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration environmental record, said it was ludicrous for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to come to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to discuss water pollution and also attacked the vice president's statement on acid rain. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, the prime sponsor of legislation to control emissions blamed for acid rain, said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has consistently opposed the measure. `` Where has Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> been for the past seven years?,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` The Reagan-Bush administration has opposed every single effort to deal with acid rain. ... For any American concerned with the environment, the choice in this election is very clear.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may not be alone on the harbor when he takes his pollution tour Thursday. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides and allies said they were considering a harbor event of their own to answer the expected <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attacks on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' handling of the harbor project.

<HEAD>Authorities Make Arrest at Cave Occupied by Environmentalists</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police arrested one member of an environmental group that has occupied three caves, but the group continued its fight Wednesday to secure protection for rare subterranean organisms. A 25-year-old woman occupying Tooth Cave was arrested for trespassing Tuesday afternoon, said <LOCATION> Travis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's deputies Formal charges were pending. Members of the group Earth First! on Monday occupied three caves in northwestern <LOCATION> Travis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, near the site of a planned shopping center. Activists continued to occupy Amber and Kretschmarr caves on Wednesday, a spokeswoman said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Reddell </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> scientist who discovered the three caves 25 years ago, said he agreed with the environmental group that they are priceless biologically. But he called their protest `` absurd, counterproductive'' and said it could threaten the very organisms the activists are trying to save. `` Those caves are small, and any time you have someone inside you change the temperature,'' he said. The protesters `` have gone completely overboard,'' he said. But Earth First! coordinator <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Dugelby </PERSON> defended the protest and said it came after months of effort to work through normal channels. `` People say we're intruding on these caves,'' she said. `` We think construction and destruction are intruding on these caves.'' The group claimed the landowner, Dr. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Purcell </PERSON>, risked damage to the caves by allowing sewer lines, detention ponds and roadways to be built on the land. However, <PERSON> Purcell </PERSON> denied the charges, saying he is working with city officials and researchers to keep the caves intact. Tooth Cave has five species of invertebrates found nowhere else on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Reddell </PERSON>, who has written about 100 articles on cave environments. But he said <PERSON> Purcell </PERSON> has been `` totally cooperative'' with explorers and with <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> researchers. <PERSON> Dugelby </PERSON> said the environmentalists want the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to place the five species _ two beetles, a spider, a pseudoscorpion and a `` cave-adapted daddy longlegs'' _ on its list of endangered species.

<HEAD>U.S. Indicts Homeowner Saying He Got River View By Cutting Its

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON> advertised his house on the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> as having a `` river view,'' but the federal government contends he got the view by chopping down trees in a national park. <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON> was indicted by a federal grand jury for allegedly destroying timber in <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Canal National Historical Park. The two-count indictment, handed down Tuesday, charges that 138 trees valued at more than $ 30,000 were cut down. `` We will not stand idly by while homeowners bordering on federal parks take it upon themselves to improve their view or otherwise enhance the value of their property by destroying park land,'' said <PERSON> Breckinridge </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Willcox </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON> faces a maximum sentence of 11 years in prison and a $ 350,000 fine. He also could be ordered to make restitution by planting trees in the affected area. Destruction of government timber is a minor misdemeanor, but the second count, disposing of government property, is a felony. <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON> and his wife put the house and four acres up for sale several years ago, advertising it as having a `` river view,'' the indictment said. It never sold, according to <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Treem </PERSON>. The indictment says the trees were cut in 1985 and <PERSON> Treem </PERSON> accused the government of `` sitting on its hands,'' in not acting before now. He said it `` seemed a little disingenuous'' for <PERSON> Willcox </PERSON> to say prosecutors `` wo n't ` stand idly by' when the alleged events happened 3 -LCB- years ago.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney, said his office received the case several months ago and proceeded `` expeditiously.''

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> plans to portray the selection of embattled Republican running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as an example of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s lack of judgment and leadership, a theme that will play a major role in Democratic strategy for the fall campaign, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign said Wednesday. `` We start this campaign on a solid footing in a close competitive race,'' <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign manager, said at a briefing on strategy for the final two months of the White House race. She said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would continue stressing two themes: his goal of extending economic prosperity to all Americans and the need for leadership at the top. Reflecting a tougher tone from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in recent days, <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> said, `` We will be aggressive, but we will be aggressive on the issues.'' <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> said the campaign would `` contrast the record of accomplishment of our ticket of <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> with the record of accomplishment or lack thereof, the record of lack of leadership on the Republican side.'' `` One issue we are certain to hear more of from Democrats across the board is the selection of Sen. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and his record and qualifications,'' she said. <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> predicted that `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is going to emerge not only as an issue but a liability because it goes to judgment and it goes to leadership.'' Campaigning in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> retorted, `` This is the first real sign that you are seeing a crumbling campaign. I've been in politics a long time. Fair play. Fair enough. I can stand the heat and I'll stay in the kitchen.'' She said the Democratic presidential campaign has paid staff in every state and is getting strong assistance from state parties as well. She cited the crucial states of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> with 75 <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> field organizers and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> with 50, as examples. `` We believe we go into the Labor Day beginning with one of the best organized campaigns that a Democrat has been able to mount,'' she said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> will appear together at a traditional Labor Day rally in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and then go their separate campaign ways. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> are preparing separate advertising campaigns to air Labor Day week. The party's advertising campaign will highlight the theme `` bringing prosperity home,'' while the initial campaign aids will focus on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' record as governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, portraying him as a skilled administrator capable of implementing the goals his goals of an improved economy and better jobs, she said. `` It's our sense right now that voters have only scant information of what <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has accomplished,'' she said. ` There is a lot of misinformation out there and we're going to correct it,'' said <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>, an indirect acknowledgment that <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has scored well in recent weeks with attacks on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on such issues as military buildup, crime and the Pledge of Allegiance. <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> also sought to counter the Republican characterization of the Democrats as the party of `` gloom and doom.'' She said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' emphasis on the economy `` reflects the concern of middle class Americans that what you have in this country is not gloom and doom, but it is two people, both working, in millions of families to make what one person made 20 years ago.'' She brushed aside concerns that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has spent an unusual amount of time the past two weeks campaigning in his home state. `` It's not an issue,'' she said. `` It's a responsibility that comes with being governor. ... With those responsibilities come a real record of accomplishment and experience.'' Asked to cite specific differences between <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> said, `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> chose as his vice president the man who led the fight for plant closing legislation. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chose as his vice president the man who led the fight against it.'' She referred to a billthat would require companies to give advance notice to workers and communities before shutting down plants. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he would place his vice president in charge of coordinating an administration war against drugs, but <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> noted that in a recent interview, the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator admitted he did not know that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> headed an administration task force to block the flow of drugs into <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` Believe me, when I get into it, I will know a lot about that program,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> in an interview published Monday.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Wednesday urged the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to stop sending planes from its territory to strike at U.S.-backed guerrillas in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The call came on the eve of a meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> between Undersecretary of State <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> and Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>. The two diplomats are meeting to discuss a series of regional issues affecting the superpowers' client states around the world, but the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> question is expected to be at the top of the agenda. On Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> accused the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> of violating the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords for the pullout of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by sending its planes to bomb the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> rebels around the northern Afghan city of <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION>. A government spokesman in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> confirmed that Soviet-based fighter aircraft were used to aid Afghan ground troops battling for <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION> but denied the action violated the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> also denied another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allegation that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> had sent troops back to <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION>, about 30 miles -LRB- 50 kms -RRB- from the Soviet border, after recently withdrawing them. But Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> dismissed <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>'s denial, saying, `` I'm sticking where I was on this question yesterday We said that these raids came from bases inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Therefore, in our view, it was a violation.'' She cited a clause in the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords which she said commits the Soviets to `` refrain from any form of interference or intervention in the internal affairs of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> declined to elaborate, saying only, `` obviously the Soviets have admitted that they have used aircraft in the bombing raids in <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION> from areas inside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Let me repeat, we wish they'd stop it.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> reiterated that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was in the process of preparing a complaint for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Good Offices Mission which monitors the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> pact. The agreement signed last April calls for the pullout of all Soviet troops by Feb. 15. The Soviets have already complied with an Aug. 15 deadline for withdrawing half of their estimated 115,000 troops following more than eight years of occupation. The Soviets have repeatedly complained to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Pakistani violations of the pact in connection with supplies to the Mujahedeen. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says it will keep arming the rebels as long as the Soviets supply the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government.

<HEAD>State Court Leaves Biaggi On Ballot</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The state's top court refused Wednesday to consider removing former Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> from the state's Democratic primary ballot, despite his resignation and conviction on corruption charges The decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> not to hear the appeal by <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s primary opponents means the popular <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democrat </LOCATION>'s name will almost certainly be on the ballot Sept. 15 even though he has said he's not a candidate. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, 70, was in his 10th term when he resigned his congressional seat Aug. 5, the day after he was convicted on federal racketeering, extortion and bribe-taking charges in connection with the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> defense scandal. Because of <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s popularity, some <ORGANIZATION> Bronx </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders believe there's a strong chance he could win the primary election. In the heavily <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> district, a primary victory often guarantees a November election victory, and that's especially true in this case because <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> also has the Republican nomination. If <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> is re-elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, it's expected that he would resign again rather than face the possibility of not being seated by his former colleagues. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had been poised to begin expulsion hearings against him when he resigned in August. In the wake of Wednesday's action, the only way <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> could get off the Sept. 15 Democratic primary ballot is by death, being nominated for a judgeship or moving out of the state. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s opponents in the Sept. 15 Democratic primary, state <PERSON> Assemblyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Engel </PERSON> and former <PERSON> Assemblyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchiselli </PERSON>, had tried to get the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> and the state courts to have <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s original nominating petitions declared invalid. The two have been rebuffed, even though <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> says he does n't want to run. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Linhardt </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Engle </PERSON>, said there probably were no grounds for bringing the appeal to the federal courts. Should <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> be re-elected and resign again, it would be up to Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> to call a special election, probably in February at the earliest. <PERSON> Linhardt </PERSON> said some <ORGANIZATION> Bronx </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders want <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> to be re-elected so they can handpick a candidate for the special election. Neither <PERSON> Engel </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Marchiselli </PERSON> are considered organization favorites. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> faces up to 20 years in prison on the counts for which he was convicted Aug. 4. He has said he would appeal. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> also has been sentenced to 30 months in prison for obstructing justice and taking a free <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> trip in an unrelated case involving alleged favors for a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> shipyard company.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and a handful of Republican congressmen are challenging a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> recommendation that export licenses be granted for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to launch U.S.-made satellites, administration and congressional sources said Tuesday. The White House national security adviser, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, told members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in a letter that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will reach a decision on the issue by mid-September. <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials argued at an interagency meeting last Thursday that allowing <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to launch the satellites aboard its Long March booster would undercut <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies that are trying to develop an Expendable Launch Vehicle -LRB- ELV -RRB-. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has barred private <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies from launching satellites aboard the Soviet Proton booster. And <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration have encouraged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms to develop a one-time booster in the wake of the Challenger shuttle disaster. The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` has expressed a concern that the approval of this export license could be to the detriment of the emerging commercial space launch industry that the president is trying to create,'' said a department official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Rep. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said in a letter to the White House that: `` Permitting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> satellites to be launched on either the <ORGANIZATION> Proton </ORGANIZATION> rocket of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> or the Long March vehicle of the Peoples' Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ both of which are government produced and backed ... would defeat the intent of presidential and congressional policy.'' `` The artificially low prices offered by these countries are less than half of the cost to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms to build similar vehicles,'' <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>'s letter to the White House was signed by five other Republican congressmen, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Broomfield </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sensenbrenner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> replied that the administration was judging applications to export satellites for launch by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` on a case-by-case basis.'' The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> favors allowing U.S.-made satellites to go up on the Long March so as not to offend the Chinese, say administration sources. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> told reporters that `` because the issue is under review, it is inappropriate for me to comment at this point.'' Other <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said the issue would be decided by the White House. The six <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members argued that giving business to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s government-owned and government-subsidized Long March booster program would: _ Jeopardize the jobs of 8,000 Americans involved in developing a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> booster _ `` Act to the detriment of our goal of assured access to space'' and undercut <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to develop a `` reserve fleet'' of launch vehicles `` in time of national emergency.'' _ `` Result in a one-way street of transferring sophisticated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aerospace technology to the Peoples' Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' Two organizations, both foreign, have applied for licenses to export U.S.-made satellites to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Aussat </ORGANIZATION>, an Austrialian company, signed a letter of intent in June with the <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to manufacture two telecommunications satellites. Asiasat, owned by British and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> concerns, is negotiating with <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> to refurbish a <ORGANIZATION> Westar </ORGANIZATION> 6 satellite that was launched by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shuttle in 1984, failed to reached the proper orbit, and was recovered by the shuttle, said <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>.

 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> Wednesday night appealed to striking workers across the country to settle local grievances with management in order to end <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s worst wave of strikes in seven years. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said the national issues of guaranteeing trade union pluralism and legalizing his banned trade union Solidarity would be taken up in round-table discussions promised by the government in the near future, according to a statement read by an aide. The aide, <PERSON> Piotr </PERSON> <PERSON> Konopka </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was conferring with strikers at the Lenin shipyard and the strike there could end very soon. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s statement came after meeting with Communist officials for the first time since the union was banned in 1982. The officials media said they discussed holding talks on workers' grievances The extraordinary, three-hour meeting was aimed at solving <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s strongest wave of strikes since the 1981 martial law crackdown. `` I am an optimist,'' a smiling <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told reporters and several dozen cheering supporters after the meeting. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> had no other comment as he left the Roman Catholic episcopate in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> by car. He conferred with top Solidarity advisers and church officials for two hours after concluding his talks with Interior Minister Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>. Earlier, a communique by the press office of the episcopate said that <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> had raised the key issues of Solidarity's future and union pluralism. `` The partners -LRB- in the talks -RRB- stated that all problems connected with union movement will be discussed at the round table. There are no taboo subjects,'' the communique said. Ten enterprises across the country remained idled by strikers demanding reinstatement of Solidarity and higher wages to offset 60 percent inflation. The state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> carried a brief report on the talks. `` Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. The talk was attended by Bishop <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dabrowski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciosek </PERSON>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> report said. Ciosek is a secretary of the official national unity organization PRON. PRON, which stands for <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rebirth </ORGANIZATION>, was set up by the government shortly after martial law. Witnesses who saw <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> leave the meeting said it was held in a villa in the <LOCATION> Mokotow </LOCATION> district of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> 300 feet from the residence of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983, then returned to the Roman Catholic episcopate, where he went after arriving from <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said the participants discussed `` the premises for holding a round-table meeting and its procedures.'' The <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> report apparently referred to Friday's proposal by <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> for broad-based `` round-table'' discussions on worker grievances. The Communist Party's ruling Politburo on Tuesday heard a report on `` preparations for the ` round-table' meeting,'' and recommended <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> continue `` the mission entrusted to him.'' Lt. Colonel <PERSON> Wieslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Gornicki </PERSON>, an aide to Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s Good Morning America today that <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> talked to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> as an `` eminent personality,'' but not as `` the chairman of a nonexistent union.'' The government demanded in exchange for the talks that <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> end a strike at the Lenin shipyard in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. When asked by reporters earlier today if he would do this, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> replied, `` I do n't have the powers.'' When asked if that meant he would not call off the strike, the Solidarity chairman said, `` I did not say so.'' Asked what he would discuss with <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said: `` How to make up for the past seven years.'' Accords signed at the <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> shipyard on Aug. 31, 1980 after a nationwide strike wave made Solidarity the only independent labor federation ever recognized in the Soviet bloc. It was suppressed with martial law in 1981 and banned the next year. The current strikes began began Aug. 16 in the coal fields of <LOCATION> Silesia </LOCATION>, in southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and spread to Solidarity's traditional stronghold in the ports and shipyards of the Baltic coast. At their peak, they affected 20 businesses employing about 100,000 people. A strike at the huge steel and heavy machinery plant in <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION>, in southeastern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, intensified this week. Senior Solidarity advisers called today's <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> meeting a historic event. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> last met with a senior government official in early 1982, when he was still interned. In recent years, he has been spoken of by the government as a private citizen, a tool of foreign powers and `` the former head of a former union.'' But in the past few months, authorities have been seeking partners in an attempt to open a dialogue with society that might help lead the country out of economic despondency. `` The results of this meeting ... will be very important for the fate of the whole country and the world,'' said <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON>, a senior Solidarity adviser. At a news conference in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, Urban, the government spokesman, said `` the starting of talks would be a common victory.'' The evening news Tuesday showed footage of the signing of the <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> agreements on Aug. 31, 1980 by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagielski </PERSON>, who at that time was the deputy prime minister. `` It's high time to try it again,'' said the television news moderator at the conclusion of the report.

<HEAD>De La Madrid To Make Final Report On Administration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON> believes his biggest accomplishment is maintaining social order while keeping the country from going bankrupt, an aide said. De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, who planned to deliver his final state of the nation message on Thursday, came to power on Dec. 1, 1982. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> was nearly bankrupt after a collapse in oil prices, inflation was rampant and the value of the peso was plunging. While he is proud of keeping <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> solvent and relatively free of unrest, `` his frustration was not being able to do the things he would have liked because of the economic limitations,'' said the aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity Tuesday. But de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s efforts to reform a corrupt political system produced <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s most democratic election since his <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> gained power in 1929. One hundred seats to be divided in proportion to the national vote were added to the lower house of the legislature, giving the opposition an opportunity to win a larger role. Opposition candidates were permitted to win local elections, especially in the north. The <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> itself instituted primaries on the municipal level, although a disagreement about presidential primaries was one factor in a split that helped the left-wing opposition, which grouped itself as the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. The result was a July 6 presidential election that saw the opposition win nearly 50 per cent of the popular vote and a forceful voice in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. But the opposition contended the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> maintained its grip on power only through massive fraud. A long wrangle in the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> ended with the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> taking 260 seats and a divided opposition 240 _ 139 for the leftist Front and 101 for the rightist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The left also won four of 64 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the first time the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> has ever lost <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats. De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, a Harvard-trained economist, renegotiated a foreign debt that now stands at $ 104 billion while resisting pressure for a moratorium on payments. His administration took steps to reduce the role of the state in the economy, although many large industries, such as petroleum and banking, remain nationalized. Some of the steps were painful, and the peso plunge cost Mexican consumers about 50 percent of their buying power during de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s six-year term. He also had to deal with the September 1985 earthquake in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, which killed about 9,500 people. De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> downplayed <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s high profile role in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, avoiding open friction with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> over conflicts in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> while working for regional solutions. He had a good working relationship with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and argued that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> could not be solely responsible for stopping drug trafficking. De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> said the drug problem starts at the consumer level in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> prepared the way economically for his chosen successor, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, who was largely responsible for the regime's economic measures as de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s Planning and <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> secretary. In addition to loosening tight state control of the economy, de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> brought <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> into the General Agreement in Trade and Tariffs to force Mexican industralists to compete abroad and domestically. When inflation hit nearly 150 percent in 1987, de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> united government and private business in a belt-tightening economic solidarity pact that helped reduce inflation to 43 per cent in the first six months of 1988. Government figures for August show a rate of below 1 percent. De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> suffered harsh criticism from both left and right. Leftist presidential candidate <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> called for a moratorium on debt payments, saying that they are hobbling economic development. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> wants economic privatization to go farther, faster. The political reforms changed the political structure of this country and shook the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, who won with the lowest percentage ever for a <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> presidential candidate, said after the election that `` the era of the one-party rule is over.'' Referring to the drop in popular support, de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> told a group of labor leaders Tuesday that the party made mistakes. But he added, `` There is no threat to the system. We will regroup, will will fight more strongly. We are strongly enough to keep reactionaries from the left or the right to take power away from the Mexican Revolution.''

<HEAD>Hundreds Protest US Navy Ships Capable Of Launching Nuclear

 Hundreds of protesters shouted from hilltops and waved banners on boats Wednesday when two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships that can launch nuclear missiles sailed into the home port of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 7th Fleet. The ships are the first to be stationed in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> with launchers for Tomahawk missiles, which are made in both nuclear and non-nuclear versions. `` Get out from <LOCATION> Yokosuka </LOCATION>!'' about 100 people shouted in English at the gates of the naval base as the Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser USS Bunker Hill and the destroyer USS Fife arrived in the port 28 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. A coast guard official said the warships arrived without incident. Forty-two coast guard patrol boats escorted the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships into the port to prevent the approach of 28 small boats carrying protesters and banners reading `` No Tomahawks,'' the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> forbids the production, possession, or introduction into the country of nuclear weapons. Nearly 200,000 people died in the Japanese cities of <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION> when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> dropped the first atomic bombs to end World War II. After the ships arrived, more protesters from civic and peace groups, labor unions and the Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> staged separate rallies at a park overlooking the port, outside the naval base and elsewhere, carrying placards and shouting slogans. Police reported no arrests. Protesters said the biggest rally, sponsored by the communists, drew an estimated 1,000 people. On Tuesday, <LOCATION> Yokosuka </LOCATION>'s 48-member city assembly unanimously passed a resolution urging the government to keep out the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships. The city's mayor and the prefectural governor also lodged official protests Monday with the Japanese government and said it did not do enough to ensure that the ships were not carrying nuclear weapons. `` We hope our grassroot struggles will spread to a national movement,'' said <PERSON> Yoshiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Saito </PERSON>, a leader of a citizens' group staging a sit-in near the <LOCATION> Yokosuka </LOCATION> city hall. The 9,600-ton <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> and the 7,810-ton Fife both are capable of deploying Tomahawk missiles. Under the Japan-U.S. security agreement, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has pledged to notify <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> beforehand if it plans to bring nuclear arms into the country. But critics charge the Japanese government uses the agreement as a way of avoiding the question of whether <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships dock in the country with nuclear weapons aboard. Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> told reporters Wednesday that the government would not ask the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to confirm whether the ships were carrying nuclear missiles because `` we trust each other in such matters,'' <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military, which has about 50,000 personnel stationed in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, maintains a policy of not publicly confirming or denying nuclear weapons aboard its ships.

 Police captured two heavily armed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla suspects heading toward a British army barracks after driving from the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> through a remote border crossing, officials said Wednesday. Their car, seized around midnight Tuesday, contained two rifles and two pistols, said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON>, spokesman for the chief federal prosecutor's office. But he could not confirm a radio report that the men brought explosives. Since March 1987, attacks by suspected <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas against British army installations in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have killed three people and injured 40. In the latest such attack, a bomb exploded at a British army barracks in <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> on Aug. 5. Five people were injured. The attacks are part of an escalated <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> campaign against British targets in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, officials said the two men drove over the Dutch border into northwestern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> by using a remote country lane that is off limits to traffic between the two countries. German police arrested the two suspected guerrillas after they reached the town of <LOCATION> Waldfeucht </LOCATION>, 45 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION> on the Dutch border, <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> said. `` There are grounds to believe that they belong to the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said in a telephone interview. `` An investigation is now underway.'' <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> said the pair was headed toward a small British army barracks in the same community, but did not specify how close they came to the military outpost. Police became suspicious after spotting the pair near the remote crossing, which has come under closer watch after <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> attacks in the area, the spokesman said. `` One of them has a British passport, although we do not know yet if it is genuine,'' <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> said. Police have not found any documents for the other man, he said. <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> refused to release the mens' names. <ORGANIZATION> Suedwestfunk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION> reported earlier Wednesday that the suspects were carrying weapons and explosives in their car. So far this year, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> has killed 27 members of the British security forces in gun and bomb attacks in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, elsewhere in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and in continental <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> province of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and to unite it with the overwhelmingly <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.

 Passengers aboard planes sitting on the runway watched <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Flight 1141 scrape the runway and cheered for the pilot to coax the floundering jet into the air. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 lifting crashed Wednesday morning just beyond the runway at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` A lot of people on the left side of our plane were saying ` Get up! Get up!' when they saw it coming in front of us,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnett </PERSON>, an attorney from <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>. `` As the plane came up to take off, it was barely getting off the ground and the right wing was dipping as it passed beyond us. There were flames coming out of the right engine and the wing touched the ground. The plane started spinning -LRB- and -RRB- there was an explosion,'' said <PERSON> Arnett </PERSON>, whose flight had just landed. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzig </PERSON> was aboard a commuter flight that had just landed from his hometown of <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>. `` His right wing was coming straight at us. It was probably no more than a foot or 18 inches off the ground,'' <PERSON> Metzig </PERSON> said. `` As he pulled it back to the left, I do n't know how the hell he missed us, but he missed us.'' As passengers on <PERSON> Metzig </PERSON>'s plane watched the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> flight struggling to get off the ground, they began to cheer. `` It was like a football game,'' <PERSON> Metzig </PERSON> said. `` We were cheering this guy to get that plane off the ground. It was very emotional. Plus, we were in danger of our own lives. We were rooting for that pilot to get that plane up. But there was just no way,'' he said. A motorist driving along the interstate said he saw the aircraft burst into flames. `` I was coming over the bridge on I-30 in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, and I saw a big ball of fire going into the air,'' <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> told <ORGANIZATION> KRLD </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. `` I started driving over there and it looked like it was over near <LOCATION> D-FW </LOCATION>, and I thought, ` No way could it be an airplane accident.''' `` I could tell it was over near <LOCATION> D-FW </LOCATION>. It was an unbelievably big explosion. I could not believe it _ I absolutely could not believe it was that big an explosion,'' <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON> said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON>, 28, of <PERSON> Celina </PERSON>, was waiting at a gas station at the south end of the airport when the plane crashed. `` I heard the normal noise of an airplane taking off. I turned to watch and just barely saw the nose clear a building over there,'' he said pointing to a low-level warehouse-type building about a half-mile away. `` Then there was a cloud of smoke about three stories high and an explosion,'' <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON> said.

 A pre-dawn bombing Wednesday rocked a six-story building housing a church organization and leading anti-apartheid groups, injuring 23 people, police said. Investigators said they had no information on the type of explosive that struck <ORGANIZATION> Khotso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> or the identity of the bombers. The government-run South African <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said without citing sources that the bomb `` was believed to be the biggest of its kind'' in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` There has been a sinister silence surrounding the solution to these attacks -LRB- on anti-apartheid groups -RRB-,'' said Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, main occupant of the <LOCATION> Khotso </LOCATION> building. `` When community buildings and -LRB- anti-apartheid -RRB- organizations are attacked no one is found -LRB- responsible -RRB- in almost all the instances,'' said <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, whose organization includes most of the country's largest Protestant denominations. <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> also expressed concern the council's files might be searched by police investigating the blast. Authorities declared the building unsafe and police barred journalists and the people who work in <ORGANIZATION> Khotso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> from entering. However, an <ORGANIZATION> SABC </ORGANIZATION> television crew was allowed inside and the organization broadcast extensive footage on the evening newscast. <ORGANIZATION> Khotso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> _ which means `` House of Peace'' in the Zulu language _ serves as headquarters for the council of churches and the Black Sash civil rights group, two of the most prominent anti-apartheid organizations not yet affected by government bans. Several other church and human rights groups have offices in the building, and it housed offices of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> before the nationwide coalition and 17 other groups were banned in February. The church council has taken a lead role in the anti-apartheid movement since the bannings. The 1 a.m. explosion in the basement of the building slightly injured a night watchman, passers-by, and residents of nearby apartment buildings. The floor of the main lobby collapsed into the basement. Cars parked in the building's underground garage were destroyed and adjacent buildings were heavily damaged. Last year, there were several unsolved bombings and arson attacks on offices of anti-apartheid groups and militant black labor unions. Activists suggested these attacks were carried out by right-wing vigilantes, either within or outside the security forces. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions, whose offices were severely damaged last year, described Wednesday's bombing as part of a `` continuous campaign against the opponents of apartheid.'' The congress, the nation's main black labor federation, said it had heard nothing from police about investigations of the 1987 blast at its headquarters. This year, there have been a series of bombings of restaurants and other civilian targets that authorities have blamed on the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement, which seeks to topple the white-dominated government. Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> expressed condolences to the 23 people injured Wednesday and said police were conducting a `` comprehensive investigation.'' He said officers were hampered by the fact that the building had been declared unsafe.

<HEAD>Chief Tries to Stop Talk Show on Police Brutality</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The city police chief says two men should be prosecuted for appearing on a radio talk show to tell how they saw guards kick a handcuffed prisoner at the local jail. Chief <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerwens </PERSON> had warned WNWS-AM and the men that their comments violated a state law forbidding disclosure of an official complaint against a police officer. The show was broadcast anyway last week, and <PERSON> Gerwens </PERSON> said Tuesday he would ask the police legal adviser whether the two could be charged. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Hochman </PERSON>, the legal adviser, said Wednesday he had talked briefly to Gerwens but had n't decided what steps to take. `` It's so blatantly a prior restraint on the press,'' said radio host <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Rantel </PERSON>. `` I never knew it was against the law for people to describe what they've witnessed.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bado </PERSON>, one of the two guests, said he decided to speak with <PERSON> Rantel </PERSON> and newspaper reporters because he believes the law is wrong. `` Under this law, you're denied the right to talk about what you saw before you say it,'' he said. Gerwens, however, defended the law, saying discussing allegations against police in the media `` could impede a successful and thorough investigation.'' <PERSON> Bado </PERSON>, a marketing vice president for a financial company, said he and his friend <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Detrick </PERSON> were bicycling Aug. 23 when they stopped to watch police arrest a woman for disorderly conduct. Police reports say officers warned the two men to move on. <PERSON> Bado </PERSON> said that when they did not move quickly enough, they were arrested. In a jail holding cell that night, <PERSON> Bado </PERSON> said he saw an inmate, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, 40, kicked repeatedly by guards as he lay helpless on the ground with his hands cuffed behind his back. Police say <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> struck two guards and spit on them, and they struggled to get him under control. <PERSON> Bado </PERSON> said he also saw a guard partially disrobe another inmate as other guards hooted at him. After <PERSON> Bado </PERSON> was freed, he called the police department's internal affairs department and made an appointment to discuss the matter. <PERSON> Gerwens </PERSON> said that call officially started the investigation, and under the 1982 law, <PERSON> Bado </PERSON> and <PERSON> Detrick </PERSON> were therefore prohibited from talking about it. Violation of the law is a first-degree misdemeanor.

<HEAD>Afghan, Two Soviets Join Cosmonauts In Space Station</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An Afghan cosmonaut who has flown combat missions against rebels in his country arrived with two Soviets at a manned space station Wednesday and appealed for peace in his homeland. State-run television transmitted live as the Afghan cosmonaut and his two <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> colleagues entered the space station and met with the two cosmonauts already on board. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Titov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Musa </PERSON> <PERSON> Manarov </PERSON> already have spent eight months in space and hope to break the 326-day space endurance record in December. That record was set by Soviet cosmonaut <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Romanenko </PERSON>, who returned to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> on Dec. 29. Afghan <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohmand </PERSON>, in a message addressed to his countrymen from the Soviet space station Mir, which means `` peace,'' said violence could not be seen from outer space. `` I would like to believe that such will be the situation on the land inhabited by my brothers and sisters, on the land of our fathers and mothers who have suffered so much during the years of the war,'' he said during the live transmission by state-run Soviet television. <LOCATION> Mohmand </LOCATION>'s presence on the flight represents an effort by the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> to boost the prestige of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s pro-Soviet government as Soviet troops withdraw. The Soviets have agreed to withdraw all soldiers, who were sent to bolster that government, by Feb. 15, 1989. <LOCATION> Mohmand </LOCATION>, 29, has flown combat missions against the anti-government rebels in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> as a pilot in its air force. The three additional cosmonauts traveled into space aboard their Soyuz TM-6 capsule, which blasted off Monday from the Baikonur space center in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. It docked with the Mir space station 9:41 a.m. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> time -LRB- 1:41 a.m. EDT -RRB-. `` The cosmonauts feel well,'' the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The five cosmonauts, wearing navy blue flight suits, were shown by state television hugging, shaking hands and smiling aboard Mir. One of them demonstrated an unusual position weightlessness makes possible by standing horizontally. State-run television showed <LOCATION> Mohmand </LOCATION> reading portions of the Koran, the holy book of Islam, on the space station Wednesday. `` This is the first prayer to be made in Mir,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is an officially atheist nation. The Afghan was accompanied by Soviets <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyakhov </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Polyakov </PERSON>, who will stay aboard Mir to monitor the health of <PERSON> Titov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Manarov </PERSON> as they try to break the endurance record. The efforts are a step toward determining whether a manned flight to Mars, which will taken an estimated three years, is feasible. <PERSON> Titov </PERSON>, 40, and <PERSON> Manarov </PERSON>, 37, have been in space since Dec. 21. Their last visitors were a Soviet-Bulgarian crew that came aboard in June. <LOCATION> Mohmand </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lyakhov </PERSON> are to return to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> on Tuesday. Two dozens experiments are planned during the visit of the joint Soviet-Afghan Soyuz crew. <LOCATION> Mohmand </LOCATION> is to take part in experiments to identify oil, gas and other mineral deposits in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and predict runoff of snow and ice in efforts to alleviate water shortages. <PERSON> Polyakov </PERSON> underwent an operation before the flight to remove bone marrow. When he returns to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, more marrow will be removed and the samples compared. Scientists are trying to determine how to counter bone marrow depletion, which results from prolonged space flight. <PERSON> Polyakov </PERSON> also will study motion sickness.

 A smoker became outraged and shoved a flight attendant across an aisle when he was told he could n't light up, a prosecutor said, but a defense attorney argued that the man did n't touch any airline employee <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Tabacca </PERSON>, 34, a mortician, was on board a <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in December when it was announced shortly before take-off that smoking would be banned on the flight. But <PERSON> Tabacca </PERSON> insisted on lighting up and twisted a flight attendant's arm and shoved her when she tried to stop him, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scroggie </PERSON> said Tuesday in his opening statement in federal court here. <PERSON> Scroggie </PERSON>, who also alleged that <PERSON> Tabacca </PERSON> hurled obscenities at flight service manager <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, said that as <PERSON> Tabacca </PERSON> was leaving the plane, he `` intentionally rammed his shoulder into her'' and `` swung his garment bag directly into <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>'s leg.

All the people surrounding Mr. <PERSON> Tabacca </PERSON> who could be found saw nothing,'' Ms. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said. Although <PERSON> Tabacca </PERSON>'s ticket was for the smoking section, federal regulations require airlines to provide no-smoking seats for all passengers who arrive on time and want them. Prosecutors say this meant most seats on the flight needed to be converted. The defense attorney claims <PERSON> Tabacca </PERSON> was unfairly singled out by authorities who named him and one other smoker in an indictment. While she says <PERSON> Tabacca </PERSON> did light a cigarette, she denies her client touched Ms. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tabacca </PERSON>, if convicted, faces a 20-year prison sentence and a possible $ 250,000 fine, <PERSON> Scroggie </PERSON> said.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A court has ordered a town house owner in one of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s most elegant neighborhoods to lop off a fifth-story addition under construction that officials fear will disturb the atmosphere of posh <LOCATION> Beacon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. `` It's a piece of architecture that is going to be with us for a long time if it's not done,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Beacon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Architectural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday. `` These things do n't just come and go like flowers in a planting bed. But the owner's attorney, <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carbone </PERSON>, said his client is being treated unfairly because the city decreed that the original 119-year-old row house be torn down during renovations because of a rotting foundation, then rebuilt with the facade restored to its original condition. `` The whole issue here is that once the city ordered the building torn down, can the architectural commission order us to rebuild it as it was in 1869,'' <PERSON> Carbone </PERSON> said. `` That's an interesting opinion,'' said <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>, who responded by pointing to court decisions backing the commission's stand. The commission in 1985 approved some renovation for <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s house, but did not approve an additional floor, <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> said The commission allowed him to take down the facade, but said bricks had to be removed by hand, numbered and put back in place. Court papers said in addition to the extra floor, many of the bricks were tossed into a pile and broken and some instructions on maintaining the facade were not followed. The owner, <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, declined to comment Wednesday. <PERSON> Carbone </PERSON> said <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> planned to build a town house that would fit in with other structures in the area. `` We tried very, very hard to satisfy the commission,'' he said. The Beacon Hill Historic District was established in 1955 to preserve the neighborhood as an example of old <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Devereaux </PERSON>, an attorney for the commission. Much of the area, home to the well-heeled of 18th-century <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, has been transformed inwardly into condominium developments. But the outward facades remain for the most part town houses of dark-red brick, some with ornate windows and entryways. Zoning regulations in the area would allow a fifth floor, but the architectural commission, a five-member panel appointed by the mayor, has final say on any structural changes visible to the public. <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> on June 21 upheld the commission's decision forbidding the fifth floor and ordered <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> to tear down construction. A hearing date has not been set in the case, currently before the state <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. While the case is pending, white sheets are draped over part of the building and a temporary roof has been erected to cover initial construction above the fourth floor. <PERSON> Carbone </PERSON> noted that other renovated buildings in the district are taller than the original structures. The commission does not try to maintain strict preservation, and allows new materials to be used and changes to be made if they are judged to be in keeping with the area, <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> said. But adding a floor to a building would change the character of the structure, he said. `` There has n't been an enormous problem in having people conform,'' he said. `` In fact, there's quite a bit of support for it.''

<HEAD>Magistrate Recommends Contempt Citation Against Agriculture
Secretary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal magistrate has recommended that a contempt citation be brought against <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> for failing to fully obey a court order barring the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> from calling in crop-storage loans. Magistrate <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Symchych </PERSON> made the recommendation Tuesday to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLaughlin </PERSON>, who had issued a preliminary injunction July 21 against the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s loan-cancellation plan <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> has 10 days from Tuesday in which to file objections to the contempt recommendation. According to the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> attorney general's office, which is a party to the suit against the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, the department did not comply with the injunction until July 29, when it announced that certain loans could be extended until Aug. 31. The announcement came after many farmers already had settled their loans with the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, the attorney general's office said. Symchych recommended all loans due and payable after July 22 be extended. For loans that matured on July 31 and were settled by farmers before any extensions were available, <PERSON> Symchych </PERSON> recommended that <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> restore those farmers to the position they would have been in had the federal agency obeyed the injunction. `` The court can not allow defendants -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to circumvent the purpose of the injunction by simply employing new tactics or strategies which achieve the same unlawful result,'' <PERSON> Symchych </PERSON> said in a report. The federal reserve program allows farmers to hold surplus grains off the market while receiving government price supports and storage fees. In effect, the grain is collateral for the loans. Because the drought has tightened grain supplies, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is calling the loans in order to force the farmers to sell the grain. In addition to the contempt citation, <PERSON> Symchych </PERSON> recommended the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> be fined $ 1,000 for each loan it canceled after <PERSON> MacLaughlin </PERSON>'s injunction went into effect <PERSON> Symchych </PERSON> also recommended the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> be given until Sept. 30 to comply with the order. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> was on vacation and unavailable for comment, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, acting undersecretary for international affairs and commodity programs for the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, said he would not comment on the matter because it is under litigation. Attorney General <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> brought the suit against the department on behalf of Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> and seven <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> farmers. He contended that the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> failed to go through the formal government rule-making procedures before it decided to stop extending the loans. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, announced Tuesday that it would stop extending crop loans as of Wednesday, irrespective of <PERSON> MacLaughlin </PERSON>'s injunction The announcement came before <PERSON> Symchych </PERSON>'s recommendation was issued. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> were expected to seek a court hearing this week to halt implementation of the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s new plan.

 Flooding in six northern states has forced about 100,000 people from their homes, the president's office said Wednesday The flooding has destroyed hundreds of thousands of acres of crops and killed thousands of farm animals, according to televised news reports. President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> has asked <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s congress to approve $ 8 million in disaster assistance to the states of <LOCATION> Cordoba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlantico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sucre </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Magadalena </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> and Bolivar. Heavy rain is expected to continue for the next few days, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s weather service said Wednesday. The biggest river in the region, the <LOCATION> Magdalena </LOCATION>, overflowed its banks Saturday. The flooding has caused an increase in the number of mosquitoes, the public health department for the state of <LOCATION> Cordoba </LOCATION> said in a news release. Malaria and dengue fever, both carried by mosquitoes, is common in the <LOCATION> Magdalena </LOCATION> river region. Twenty people have been bitten by poisonous snakes in <LOCATION> Cordoba </LOCATION> since flooding began there two weeks ago, the health department said.

<HEAD>4,000 Starved To Death In South, Tens of Thousands Threatened</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Four thousand men, women and children have died of starvation and tens of thousands residing in the war-torn regions of southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> face a similar fate, officials said Wednesday. <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Beda </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s Council for the South, said the only way to save those starving in the <LOCATION> Equatoria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bahr </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Ghazal </LOCATION> regions was with emergency air shipments of food and medical supplies. In <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, the Rev. <PERSON> Aengus </PERSON> <PERSON> Finucane </PERSON>, director of the Dublin-based aid agency CONCERN said about 40 people were dying daily at a refugee camp in el <LOCATION> Meriam </LOCATION>, 500 miles south of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, and that about 2 million people faced death from the ravages of war and starvation. <PERSON> Beda </PERSON> said most southerners abandoned their crops and cattle in the countryside and fled to towns and cities because of fierce fighting in the five-year civil war. He said residents are being beseiged by the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and dying of starvation as food supplies dwindle. <PERSON> Beda </PERSON>, whose group includes southern political representatives from Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON>'s government, said record floods in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> earlier this month diverted the attention of Western relief organizations from what he called the `` catastrophe'' of the south. `` Four thousand people have died of hunger in -LRB- the town of -RRB- <LOCATION> Aweil </LOCATION> so far,'' he said. <LOCATION> Aweil </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Bahr </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Ghazal </LOCATION> region, is 587 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>. Asked about <PERSON> Finucane </PERSON>'s estimates for the number of southerners dying, <PERSON> Beda </PERSON> said he lacked exact figures, `` but, yes, you can say the reports about people dying by thousands is correct.'' In <LOCATION> Torit </LOCATION>, 787 miles south of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, about 10,000 people were stranded without food and facing starvation, <PERSON> Beda </PERSON> said. He said the bishop of <LOCATION> Torit </LOCATION> described the situation as critical. <PERSON> Beda </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> Wau </LOCATION>, 662 miles southwest of the capital, faced a similar situation as did residents in <LOCATION> Juba </LOCATION>, 750 miles south of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Malakal </LOCATION>, 425 miles south of the capital. `` For at least four months, no food or essential commodities has reached those towns. No medicine has reached them either, so people die,'' <PERSON> Beda </PERSON> said. He said the only way to save those people was to make emergency air drops of food and medical supplies. The rebel <ORGANIZATION> SPLA </ORGANIZATION> in recent years has shot down two civilian aircrafts, killing 73 people, and several military planes. It has accused the government of using civilian and relief planes to transport military troops and equipment and has threatened to shoot down any plane flying over the south. The civil war has forced at least 820,000 people to flee their homes in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and trek to neighbouring <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. They usually head by foot or by train to southern cities and towns that are controlled by the army, or northward to <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>. In 1986, Western relief agencies warned that up to 2 million southerners faced starvation because they were dependent on relief food in the cities and because the rebels controlled 90 percent of the countryside, making it almost impossible to get supplies to them. Despite the rebel attacks, relief agencies have been sporadically flown in supplies from neighbouring countries, or used trucks, trains and barges from <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>. The rebels, mostly Christians and animists, are seeking more autonomy as well as economic and administrative reforms from the Moslem majority government in the north.

 Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> voiced concern Wednesday that recent court decisions could cost the agency more than $ 3 billion a year and bankrupt its single-family mortgage insurance fund. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>, assistant housing secretary and commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, expressed what he described as `` fear and alarm'' over a decision in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> here Tuesday that prevents <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> from selling any of the 47,000 foreclosed homes in its inventory. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> temporarily blocked <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> from selling the homes to the highest bidder unless they are for the benefit of homeless or low-income people. <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>, along with <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> general counsel <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>'s decision, if upheld, would halt <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> property sales which provide about $ 3.2 billion in annual revenues. The <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> fund has current reserves of about $ 6 billion. `` Imposing a freeze on our disposition program could well threaten the financial solvency of <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> since our basic home mortgage insurance program receives no congressional appropriations and has no authority to borrow from the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> would ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to clarify whether the department has complied with legislation last year that was intended to benefit the homeless. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>'s temporary restraining order expires Sept. 14. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON>, who has jurisdiction over the case, will schedule further action. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> issued his order in response to a plea by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>, one of the homeless advocacy groups fighting <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s single-family home sales policy, because <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> planned to sell 170 homes in metropolitan <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Wednesday. Last week, the project succeeded in preventing <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> from selling 200 such homes in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> insures more than 6 million home mortgages with outstanding balances of nearly $ 230 billion. In recent years, he said, 30 to 40 percent of all new homes sold for less than $ 100,000 have been insured by the <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is a program that has helped 17 million <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> families obtain home ownership and has received bipartisan support from all segments,'' he said. `` It would be tragic if we were to put a program like this at risk _ especially at a time when there is a growing consensus over over the need to do more to help reverse the recent trend toward declining home ownership rates,'' <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> said. `` We need to do more to help working class families obtain home ownership _ not less,'' he said. <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> has 400 homes under lease or that have been sold to homeless persons. `` We want this number to grow, and are eager to work with homeless advocates to devise ways that we can make more <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> foreclosed homes available,'' <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> said. `` But what we object to is a strategy that pits the needs of hard-working families who want to buy modestly priced homes with the needs of the homeless,'' he said. `` It should n't be a case of one versus the other. And surely we can find ways of doing more to help the homeless without bankrupting the <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> fund.''

<HEAD>Drought Raising Veggie Prices for Consumers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Drought continues to put the bite on consumer food dollars, including higher prices for fresh vegetables this summer and signs that processed items also will be more costly in 1989, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report said Wednesday. Prices paid to growers for fresh vegetables jumped more than 21 percent from July to August, the report said. And this summer's prices overall could be up 10 percent from the third quarter of 1987, a period when fresh vegetable prices usually decline `` However, this year's extremely dry weather, coupled with minimum irrigation in the North Central states, reduced supplies and put upward pressure on prices in midsummer,'' the department <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. `` As local supplies tighten, consumers likely will be be more dependent than usual on vegetables shipped from more distant areas.'' The government's Consumer Price Index for fresh vegetables, including potatoes, rose 4 percent from June to July and was up 5 percent from July 1987. Potatoes, lettuce and tomatoes are the most important in the fresh vegetable index. Retail potato prices were up seasonally in July and were also boosted slightly by the drought's impact on the summer crop. `` Lettuce prices tend to be seasonally low in July, and were slightly lower this July due to large <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> supplies,'' the report said. `` Tomato prices tend to be down in July, as tomatoes are the most commonly grown vegetable in home gardens, which reduces summer demand. However, the drought boosted this July's prices. The CPI for processing vegetables is generally flat in the summer, but it rose 1 percent in July, the report said. Prices are expected to continue rising through 1989 as higher wholesale costs work through the marketing pipeline.

<TEXT>
 A contract dispute between <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> producers and the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union is threatening to disrupt the film and television industry as it recovers from the five-month scriptwriters' strike. The <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> contract with the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> expired July 30, and only day-to-day contract extensions have prevented the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> from striking. The union was scheduled to announce late Wednesday the results of a vote on the producers' latest contract offer, with members expected to reject the contract by an overwhelming margin. Another negotiating session was set for Thursday morning. A walkout by the Teamsters, representing 2,200 film and television drivers, could put a severe crimp on <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> production as it recovers from the writers' walkout, which ended Aug. 7. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, secretary-treasurer for the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 399 </ORGANIZATION>, has said that the producers' last proposal is the most `` insulting offer'' he has seen in 43 years as a Teamster. The contract proposal, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, would require about half the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 399 </ORGANIZATION> members to take $ 2.61-per-hour pay cuts. The producers are offering a minimum salary for those drivers of $ 14 an hour, down from $ 16.61. Big-rig drivers earn more, and producers plan to raise their salaries. The producers have said that union concessions are necessary to keep costs down and prevent so-called `` runaway'' production, where film and televison crews move to non-union states and countries. `` The issue is competitiveness,'' said <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, a spokesman for the alliance. `` We want to remain competitive in this market and keep production here.'' The producers estimate that runaway production has cost <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> $ 14 million in lost wages and benefits during the last two years. The producers also want to redefine rules for overtime pay.

 <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has grown from a cropduster to the nation's third-largest airline since it began operations six decades ago flying from <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, Miss. A <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727, Flight 1141 which originated in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, crashed on takeoff Wednesday at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The crash came three years and 26 days after a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L-1011 </ORGANIZATION> jet crashed at the same airport, killing 137 people. Lawsuits seeking millions of dollars in damages from that crash are still in court, although some already have resulted in multimillion-dollar judgments against <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> suffered a spate of embarrassments: Pilots landed at the wrong airport or on the wrong runway; one plane plummeted toward the ocean because the pilot mistakenly shut off the engines; another plane was involved in a near miss over the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> also grew by acquiring <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in an $ 860 million merger. Through it all, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> has maintained a reputation as a well-run, safe and financially secure airline. `` I do n't think the reputation is undeserved,'' and it probably wo n't change, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, an airline industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` If you ask people in airline maintenance who they think does the best job, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s almost always the name mentioned first,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pincavage </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said the airline is not afraid its reputation will suffer greatly because of the crash. `` You have to realize <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> flies more flights than any airline in the world,'' he said. `` We operate more flights so we have greater exposure. You have to put it in perspective. ... You look at our overall record and it's quite good.'' <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s common stock dropped $ 1 a share at news of the crash, but recovered half the loss by the close of trading to stand at $ 46.50. Analysts attributed the stock drop as much to a round of fare reductions touched off Tuesday by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> as to the crash itself. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, called <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> `` a terrifically well run airline.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> survived the embarrassing incidents last year because `` it had so much good will in the bank.'' <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s chief competitor, has been rocked by safety investigations of its aircraft and labor troubles. The airline has cut back on its routes; a plan to lay off 4,000 employees was blocked this week by a federal judge. Delta began corporate life as the world's first cropdusting service _ <ORGANIZATION> Huff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dusters </ORGANIZATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> Huff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Ogdensburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>. Then in 1928, the company, led by <PERSON> Collett </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolman </PERSON>, broke away from the parent company to form <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> with headquarters in <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> Passenger service began in 1929 with 90 mph flights from <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Woolman </PERSON>, who ran the company until his death in 1966, set the tone for <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> including a unique tradition of having pilots greet passengers as they leave each flight. The company changed its name in 1930 to <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and later to <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and moved headquarters to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in the early'40s. For the annual meeting, however, the company leaves its headquarters at <ORGANIZATION> Hartsfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> and returns to <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s growth was spurred in the early years as it added routes in the South and merged with other airlines in 1953 and 1972. But the biggest step came in 1987, when <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> completed an $ 860 million merger with <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, making it the nation's third largest airline in terms of numbers of passengers carried. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, which has 48,000 employees, posted a profit of $ 306.83 million on $ 6.92 billion in revenues during the fiscal year ended June 30.

<HEAD>Mail Workers Launch 24-Hour Strike</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 13 grafs to UPDATE with comment from union,
private mail carriers; picks up 10th pvs: `Alan Tuffin...'</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of government postal workers sealed mail boxes, stopped sorting letters and walked off their routes Wednesday to protest bonus payments that vary by region. Private delivery companies welcomed the extra business, saying it will prove they can compete. The Union of Communication Workers called a 24-hour nationwide strike, but the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION> disputed the union's claim that nearly all its 140,000 letter carriers and letter sorters had stopped working. `` It's very patchy, a patchy situation,'' said <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a Royal Mail spokeswoman. `` While there's certainly support for the strike, nevertheless quite a number of staff have turned up for work.'' She said the post office had repeatedly offered to continue talks with the union and had been `` as flexible as we can.'' The union's other 60,000 members either work for the state telephone monopoly or for the post office in administration or counter services, which were not involved in the dispute, said a union spokesman. Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said mail was being sorted and delivered in some areas, particularly the southeast and southwest, although she did not have figures for how many employees had shown up for work. Counter services were not disrupted at any of the striking <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION> post offices in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, although letter boxes had been sealed, she said. It was the first national strike at <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION> since a 1971 walkout which collapsed after 47 days. The stoppage increased demands for Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Conservative government to end the Royal Mail's near-monopoly on the delivery of letters and parcels Since she came to power in 1979, her government has sold off to private enterprise large sectors of state-owned assets under its denationalization program. The Royal Mail has the exclusive right to collect, sort and deliver all mail with a postal charge of less than one pound -LRB- $ 1.60 -RRB-. The cost of mailing an ordinary letter in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> through the Royal Mail is 18 pence -LRB- 30 cents -RRB-. <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mailfast </ORGANIZATION>, a company claiming to be the largest private carrier in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, said business rose 500 percent on Wednesday and was expected to produce long-term benefits. `` People are getting a bit upset about the threat of strikes all the time,'' said general manager <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartle </PERSON>. `` More and more people who come over to us are tending to stay.'' <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuffin </PERSON>, general secretary of the union, said the union was `` going to throw the nation's mail into chaos.'' The dispute concerns bonus payments for new recruits in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and southeastern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, where living costs are higher than in the rest of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and where the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION> has trouble recruiting and keeping staff because of high employment and competition for staff. The union wants the bonuses paid to all new recruits throughout the country or not paid at all. <PERSON> Tuffin </PERSON> said he fears the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION> management eventually wants to introduce differentials in basic pay for different areas and end national pay bargaining agreements. The bonuses range from $ 12.67 to $ 33.80 a week. The <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION> said that with the bonuses, first-year recruits in central <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> earn a basic $ 206 a week. It said the average wage for all postal workers in central <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> was $ 405 a week.

 Former Democratic candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> promised Wednesday to put aside their political animosity and work together to elect <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to the presidency. `` April 1988 is behind us. November 8 and the elections of next year are ahead of us,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said after a more than two-hour peace session convened by Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> at his <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> office. `` We're moving in that direction.'' Then <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, who apologized for the stridency of his attacks on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> during <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s primary in April, said, `` I could n't add a sentence that would improve'' on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s words. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said the focus of the meeting was finding a `` common ground,'' centering on their commitment to the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign, voter registration and an agenda of urban policies. Democratic nominee <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is battling Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a close race for the White House. Last April, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> endorsed Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> in the Democratic primary and suggested that Jews would be `` crazy'' to vote for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in light of his position on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for his `` generosity of spirit.'' But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s actions contradicted the upbeat words. At no point during the news conference did the Democratic leader stand beside <LOCATION> Koch </LOCATION>, and he kept a dour expression, despite several attempts at levity by the mayor. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, who stood between the two men as they addressed a jam-packed news conference, said it was difficult for <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> _ but especially for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> _ to sit down and discuss a truce. `` We decided it is better to compromise and conciliate than criticize. We should replace criticism with constructive compromise,'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told the news conference that it was `` in our best interest to act like mature adults and stay above attacks on integrity.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he bore no animosity toward <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, who seemed to surprise the civil rights activist by shaking his hand after addressing the crowd.

 <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> has decided to cut spending on domestic production subsidies for the 1989 wheat crop in an effort to reduce the need for export subsidies, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report said Wednesday. `` However, at this point the subsidy reduction will affect only large farms, which account for about 10 percent of total <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> wheat production,'' the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. The government of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> has been subsidizing exports of domestic wheat surpluses since 1985-86. As a result, Saudi wheat has competed against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, the report said. In addition to the wheat subsidy reduction, the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> government will attempt to reduce the country's reliance on barley imports by requiring large-scale wheat producers to plant as much barley as they do wheat.

<HEAD>Dog Carcasses Dumped in Water May Have Caused Seal Epidemic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The diseased bodies of more than 1,000 dogs dumped off <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> may have caused an epidemic that has killed at least 11,000 seals in northern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s coastal waters, the Swedish news agency <ORGANIZATION> TT </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. Sled dogs on the Arctic island died of distemper early in 1988 and the first discoveries of swollen, dead seals were reported in April in <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>. Western European experts said earlier this week the Canine Distemper Virus -LRB- CDV -RRB- or a similar one killed the seals. `` We knew that <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> was ravished by the distemper disease in March,'' <ORGANIZATION> TT </ORGANIZATION> quoted seal expert <PERSON> Berndt </PERSON> <PERSON> Klingeborn </PERSON> as saying. `` We first thought that the seals had contaminated the dogs, but after hearing that the carcasses were thrown into the water it appears to be the other way around.'' Thousands of seals migrate from <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> to Western European waters each year in search of food. Distemper virus causes infections of the respiratory and central nervous systems and digestive tracts in both dogs and seals. <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> officials have said the virus was brought to <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> by foxes, ravens and possibly polar bears across the frozen <LOCATION> Baffin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION>, where distemper was reported in October. Seal experts say up to 80 percent of the seals in affected waters will die but those remaining population will be immune to the disease. The virus has been most devastating off <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>, with 3,400 seals dead in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and almost 3,000 in <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>. About 3,900 others died off <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, 600 in Norwegian waters and 175 off the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Relief For Fire-Ravaged Northwest Predicted in October</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The fire-ravaged Northwest can expect little relief from unusually hot, dry weather until a trend toward rain and cooler temperatures begins in October, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. Above-normal temperatures will persist over much of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> during the next five days through the Labor Day weekend, government forecasters said, while seasonable temperatures can be expected elsewhere. Widespread rain will fall from the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> region to the Eastern states. The picture will remain pretty much the same through Sept. 10, the service said. Most of the nation except for the East and <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> coasts will be dry, with high temperatures over most of the West and <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> states and cool weather east of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, which has battled widespread forest fires in recent weeks, will continue to suffer abnormally warm, dry weather throughout September until a wet, cooling trend begins. `` Only the longer outlook through November brings cool, wet conditions to the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>,'' the service said. It should be warmer in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and most areas of the East, with rain extending up the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> valleys to the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> regions. Streamflows are expected to remain below average across much of the country. Although tropical storm <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> dumped four to six inches of rain across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> this week, the boost to streamflows in that area will subside in a few days, the forecast said. Water reserves at major reservoirs remain average to below average for this time of year across much of the country, the <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Despite Wednesday's fiery crash at the <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 has been a workhorse for many of the world's airlines for nearly 25 years and has garnered rave reviews for its safety after a rocky start. `` It is the most reliable airplane in the world,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>, who analyzes the aerospace industry for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION>. `` It has flown through storms and turbulence, and it's performed beautifully and reliably.'' Before they were discontinued in 1984, The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> manufactured 1,831 of them. Since the first went into service in 1964, 53 have been lost in accidents, including Wednesday's crash and four that were destroyed in terrorist attacks, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Renton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reich </PERSON> said that in the early years of the 727, the nation's airline fleets were just entering the jet age and several of the planes crashed because pilots were unaccustomed to the rapidity with which the aircraft descended during Pilots had to be retrained to cope with the so-called high sink rate. In the course of those accidents, another problem was revealed, <PERSON> Reich </PERSON> said. In the early models, lines brought fuel along the top of the fuselage from the wings to the three engines at the rear, which meant that in accidents, coach passengers would be doused with burning fuel. Within a few years, the lines were repositioned to the bottom portion of the fuselage. `` They had some difficulties in the early years, but those go back to the mid - to late'60s,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>, vice president for technical planning and development for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the airline industry trade group `` They've been a highly reliable aircraft.'' Over the years, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has issued 122 `` airworthiness directives'' ordering the owners of 727s to make specific adjustments to the planes, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. He said that represents `` a normal number for an aircraft that old.'' Of those, however, only 12 applied to the model 200, the longer, modernized version of the plane that <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> began delivering to its customers in December 1967. In all, 1,260 of the 727s manufactured were model 200s, including the jet that crashed in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> on Wednesday. The earlier versions were model 100s. One recurring problem was with the aircraft's landing gear, which <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> said were complex and had been `` kind of a headache.'' He said he did not have details on what the problem was. Gamble said the first crash involving a 727 occurred in August 1965, when one of the aircraft plummeted into <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. The next involved an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> 727 that crashed in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> in November 1965, followed three days later by an accident at <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> incidents were caused by the pilots' unfamiliarity with aircraft's rapid rate of descent, he said. Among the craft's more recent accidents, a Pan American 727 crashed after takeoff in <LOCATION> Kenner </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, on July 9, 1982 and 153 people were killed. And on Sept. 25, 1978, a <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 and private <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> 172 collided over <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, killing 144. The aircraft remains the most widely used jet in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline fleet. According to airline consultant <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, of 3,476 passenger and cargo aircraft used by American carriers, 1,148 are 727s. The second most commonly used craft is the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737, with 634 in use. The 727 is being phased out for economic reasons. Airlines have have found it less expensive to use more modern aircraft that have only two engines and require two pilots instead of the crew of three needed to fly 727s.

 Survivors of <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Flight 1141 said they heard the jetliner crumple moments before the crash Wednesday and escaped by leaping onto the plane's red-hot wings. `` You're hoping you were n't going to die,'' said <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> <PERSON> Waugh </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> attorney who was on the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 when it crashed on takeoff from <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, en route to <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` It's getting smoky and you're just trying to get the hell out of the plane.'' <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said 13 people were confirmed dead and 94 survived. `` We were just terrified,'' said <PERSON> Mona </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomason </PERSON>, who escaped with scrapes and bruises. `` We jumped on the wing, but it looked like we were jumping into a pit of fire.'' She reported seeing a woman with two children: `` She got one of them out, but I'm afraid the other one was caught in the fire.'' Passenger <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> said the aircraft veered to the right on take-off, and he heard a banging noise under the carriage. `` Then someone said, ` We're not going to make it!''' he said. `` After the crash someone kicked the door open. I jumped on the plane, and I was lucky because I just hurt my wrist.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s traveling companion, <PERSON> Geoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkes </PERSON>, said the plane lost power as it took off, and he saw the right wing tip hit the ground. Flames shot past his window, and jet fuel dripped down the windows. `` People were saying, ` Let's get out of here! Let's get out!''' <PERSON> Parkes </PERSON> said. `` I jumped on the wing following <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> and got out.'' <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, who is six months pregnant, and her sons, <PERSON> Adam </PERSON>, 2, and <PERSON> Evan </PERSON>, 5, escaped without serious injury by leaping through a crack near the bulkhead. `` It was a big fire,'' <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> said. `` We jumped out, but we were n't scared.'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammock </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> suburb, said the plane bounced three times on takeoff and skidded off the runway. `` We did n't make 50 feet in the air. We skidded and then the engine exploded. There was pandemonium,'' said <PERSON> Hammock </PERSON>, whose right sleeve was streaked with jet fuel. `` People were jumping on the plane's wing and burning themselves on it because it was so red-hot.'' <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tupelo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, said she remembers praying out loud and saying, `` Oh God, here we go'' as the jet went down. `` I felt the engines losing power and noises like tires blowing out on takeoff,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, who suffered only a bruise on her leg. `` The fuselage filled with smoke and there was a lot of noise. `` I hung on until the emergency door next to me opened, then I climbed out on the wing and hit the ground running.''

 American oilmen are negotiating quietly in hopes of resuming Libyan operations if the next <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration ends or modifies the economic embargo imposed on <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s government in 1985 In the past two years, the chairman of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s state petroleum company has met with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil company officials in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and other West European cities, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> oil company official said Wednesday. He said the two sides are discussing a possible return of the Americans under terms of an agreement signed a few months after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> imposed the embargo on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> in 1986. The agreement on July 1, 1986, froze <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> oil company assets and allowed the Libyans to work their oil fields, the Western source said, with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> assuming all costs but also taking all the income. Before the embargo, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> got 51 percent of the oil produced by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies. The agreement provides for the same split if the embargo is lifted and the source said of the Americans: `` They will return.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies said to be involved are <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Oasis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> and a consortium of <ORGANIZATION> Conoco </ORGANIZATION>, Marathon and <PERSON> Amerada </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>. The 1986 agreement expires June 30, 1989, but if the Americans are not back by then an extension probably will be arrianged because both sides are eager to do business again, the source said. An official of the state oil company said: `` We are waiting to see what happens at the start of next year,'' and expressed a common Libyan opinion that restrictions might be relaxed when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves office. All those who commented did so on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> imposed the sanctions in January 1986 because of <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s alleged support of terrorism, and forbade Americaans to work in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. The work ban has been costly for <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. The state oil company official said it replaced the departing American workers by advertising around the world for highly skilled managers and technicians. He said the places were filled by Britons, Canadians, Swedes, Indians and French workers, but at a high cost. About 400 Americans worked in the Libyan oil industry before the embargo, he said. Spare parts for American equipment also had to be obtained elsewhere at higher prices. Lower world prices have caused <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s oil revenue to decline from $ 22 billion in 1980 to $ 6 billion in 1986.

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised action to reduce acid rain on Wednesday and declared `` I am an environmentalist.'' Rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> shot back: `` Talk about an election-year convert.'' Seeking to gain the initiative after two weeks of moribund campaigning, the Democratic presidential nominee delivered a broad attack on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for a second day, ridiculing his statements on the environment and demanding an explanation of his role in the Iran-Contra debacle. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, avoided mention of his rival's name _ a new course after weeks of calculated attacks But his Republican running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> picked up the cudgel and denounced <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a `` defeatest liberal.'' The Republicans continued to poke fun at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s aged snow blower that became a symbol of his frugality at the Democratic convention. `` His ideas are as old as that 25-year-old snow blower,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign strategists were targeting <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator whose selection stunned even <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> insiders. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> said they would depict his selection as an indication of poor judgment by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and would make that one of the central themes of the fall campaign. `` One issue we are certain to hear more of from Democrats across the board is the selection of Senator <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and his record and qualifications,'' she said at a briefing in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was unbowed by the prospect of two more months of personal attack, saying, `` I can stand the heat and I'll stay in the kitchen.'' A new <ORGANIZATION> ABC-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll released Wednesday found twice as many voters thought the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was more qualified than <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. But two-thirds said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> should remain on the ticket. The poll showed the presidential race a statistical dead heat _ <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 48 percent to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 47 percent, within the 3.5-point margin of error of the survey Aug. 24-30 of 1,129 registered, likely voters. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stood on the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> shore of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> to deliver a speech aimed at separating himself from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration with more activist positions on major environmental issues of acid rain, the `` greenhouse'' effect and pollution of waters. `` Polluters should pay,'' the vice president said. `` I am an environmentalist, always have been, from my earliest days growing up and then as a congressman ... and I always will be.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned a trip onto his rival's home ground on Thursday with a visit to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> aimed at making the harbor's long-standing pollution problem an embarrassment to the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor Attempting a pre-emptive strike, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> blasted the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administraiton for cutting funding for the Clean Water Act, some of which could have been used for the harbor cleanup. `` We are doing it, no thanks to Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or the administration,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. He displayed scorn for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s promise of action on acid rain, saying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> really would rather spend money on the Star Wars space-based defense program than on environmental protection. `` Talk about an election-year convert,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. Damaging increases in the acidity of rainfall has been tied to emissions from coal-fired power plants and other sources, including auto exhausts. `` On the question of acid rain, the time for study alone has passed,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` We know enough to begin taking steps to limit future damage ... as president, I will ask for a program to cut millions of tons of sulfer dioxide emissions by the year 2,000 and to significantly reduce nitrogen oxide emissions as well.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appeared at a news conference in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, one of the Iran-Contra investigators and co-author of a book that criticizes <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s role in the missiles-for-hostages deal with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people would like to know the answer to a continuing question,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, you sat through five meetings, five meetings on the subject. How can you say now that you did not know that it was a straight arms-for-hostages deal?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> demanded. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> campaigned before students at <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and toured an Exxon oil refinery. He said he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` vigorously disagree'' with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s opposition to offshore oil exploration. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has called for no new offshore drilling _ and has stressed that position in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where it is a major issue. Campaigning in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in the spring, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opposed administration plans to lease new oil plots off the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast and called for more study instead. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where he planned to campaign Thursday before stopping in other Western states Friday and Saturday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was campaigning in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> on Thursday and Friday. Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was vacationing in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. His Republican counterpart was remaining in the South the rest of the week.

 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> urged Wednesday that an early exchange of prisoners be arranged with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, official <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio reported. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, the daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> as saying <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> negotiators have dalayed progress on prisoner exchange and other issues in a settlement of the 8-year-old war. He said the purpose was to force concessions from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on the disputed Shatt-al-Arab waterway, which forms their southern border and is <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s only outlet to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION> reported. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio said <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> made the comments to Iranian reporters in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, where peace talks were stalled for the fifth straight day. `` Our aim is that the exchange of prisoners of war should take place as soon as possible,'' <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said. `` The very urgent problems facing Iranian families need to be resolved -LRB- so that -RRB- our loved ones, who have been captured, may return to their homes.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has listed 46,098 prisoners in its camps, but <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials say many have not been unregistered and the real number may be about 70,000. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> furnished a list of 18,139 Iranian prisoners as of Aug. 1, but <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> authorities told <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials many recent detainees had not been registered. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials believe that could bring the total to 35,000. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> also called for renewed efforts to return Iraqi refugees to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, the radio report said. Thousands of Kurdish civilians fled to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> because of battles between the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> army and Iranian-backed Kurdish guerrillas. Other refugees are Shiite Moslems from southern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> declared, according to the radio: `` Fundamental thinking must be done in order to facilitate the honorable return of Iraqi refugees, be they Kurds or Arabs, to their own country, and in order to restore these people's rights.'' No official count of the refugees has been given. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Monde </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> as saying the Iraqis hoped to win sovereignty over the <PERSON> Shatt-al-Arab </PERSON>, and `` If we give in to these <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> demands, nothing guarantees us that they will not draw up other conditions just as difficult. Why would we be the only ones to make concessions?'' The paper also quoted <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> as claiming in an interview that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> still hold more than 380 square miles of Iranian territory, including the towns of <PERSON> Khosravi </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Naft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shahr </ORGANIZATION>, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had withdrawn from all Iraqi territory.

<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> are locked in a dead heat in their presidential race, according to the latest poll of registered voters released Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> @ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> survey found <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> holding a one-point lead over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ 48 percent to 47 percent _ that was negated by the poll's 3.5 percent margin of error. The poll of 1,129 likely voters conducted Aug. 24 through Tuesday night was similar to the last survey which found <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading by two points _ 48 percent to 46 percent. The last poll was completed Aug. 23. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> enjoyed his biggest lead in the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> @ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> survey shortly after the Democratic National Convention in July when he led his <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> opponent by 15 percentage points. According to the latest survey, twice as many voters _ 53 percent _ believe <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is more qualified that his GOP rival <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> than the reverse _ 26 percent. The poll also found that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s aggressive campaign style of the past few days _ and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' lack of response _ has had little effect on two key groups: Democrats who voted for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1980 and 1984 and independents. Among the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Democrats, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> led 58 percent to 34 percent, a marginal change from his 57 percent to 31 percent lead over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last week. The Republican nominee added no new independents this week although he continues to lead among that group _ 52 percent to 38 percent. The gender gap, in which women's voting patterns vary from men, narrowed slightly but <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> still holds an advantage. In the latest poll, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> led 51 percent to 43 percent among women voters while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> held a 51 percent to 44 percent lead among men.

 An anti-abortion group said Wednesday it will scale back the sit-ins that have led to hundreds of arrests at <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> abortion clinics and will encourage jailed protesters to identify themselves and leave jail. An abortion clinic official called the moves a defeat for the New York-based anti-abortion group, Operation Rescue. `` In light of all the other false claims they've made, this is a graceful way to bow out,'' said <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Randall </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Feminist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nash </PERSON>, media coordinator for Operation Rescue, answered, `` That's wishful thinking on their part. They do n't know us and they do n't know what we're capable of.'' She said the group plans to recruit and conduct training in non-violent protest techniques for an Oct. 5-8 blitz in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> comparable to sit-ins staged at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> abortion clinics in May. She said 1,648 people were arrested then and some clinics were temporarily closed. About 25 of the more than 700 people arrested in a month of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> sit-ins remained in jail Wednesday, down from as many as 250 earlier, Ms. <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> said. Police spokesman <PERSON> Cal </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said 24 protesters were in city holding facilities at the latest count Tuesday, and a <ORGANIZATION> Fulton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officer, who asked not to be identified, said two protesters were still in the county jail Wednesday. Some protesters spent up to 40 days in jail, often fasting, before giving their names and being released on bond or on their own recognizance, Ms. <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> said. `` The demonstrations will be on a back burner for six weeks. We might do one a week. ... We're getting ready for a long struggle here,'' Ms. <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> said. Mass arrests of the demonstrators began during the Democratic National Convention July 19. Many identified themselves only as Baby <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> or Baby <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>, in symbolic solidarity with aborted fetuses, and city officials would not release them until they provided their real names. The demonstrators originally planned to remain jailed only during the Democratic convention, Ms. <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> said. The organization dug in and called for more people to go to jail when the city continued to insist that the protesters identify themselves. She said Operation Rescue changed its tactics because of `` the people in the jail who wanted to come out and recruit.'' Ms. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> said the group had to give up because it failed to pack local jails or to shut down a clinic. `` People were disgusted with their tactics,'' Ms. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> said. `` They were mean and vicious to the clients, to the police, to the -LRB- abortion -RRB- providers.''

The four are being treated at <ORGANIZATION> Brooke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where a family of three Americans also was headed Wednesday after being put on a plane from a West German hospital. The four servicemen arrived early Wednesday via a C-141 cargo plane. Three were in guarded condition, said Dr. <PERSON> Basil </PERSON> <PERSON> Pruitt </PERSON>, head of the burn unit. They were identified as Air Force Master Sgt. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>, 31, stationed at <ORGANIZATION> Kelly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>; Army 1st Lt. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Strader </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pfc </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Myron </PERSON> <PERSON> Riggs </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Anderea </LOCATION>, or <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, <PERSON> DelaRosa </PERSON>, 33, a sergeant major assigned to the Italian Embassy. `` In all of the patients, the majority of the burns are third-degree, which means that ultimately considerable skin grafting will have to be done to close the wounds,'' <PERSON> Pruitt </PERSON> said at a news conference. He said the four would be in the hospital between six and eight weeks, but he declined to discuss each case specifically. Two suffered from smoke inhalation, one has a head injury and another has a broken left leg, which may have to be amputated, he said. The victims were among those injured Sunday when three Italian jets crashed during an air show at <ORGANIZATION> Ramstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. More than 40 people were killed and 500 were injured. `` During the first two-to-three-day period, the main consideration centers on maintaining vital organ function and preventing shock and then the care centers on the care of the wound to remove dead tissue and effect a timely closure of the wound by skin grafting,'' <PERSON> Pruitt </PERSON> said. Also on Wednesday, officials said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> McCanch </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>, and their 2-year-old son, <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, were put on a plane headed to the medical center from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where they had been undergoing treatment for injuring suffered in the air show crash. On Monday, a five-member team of burn specialists from the center flew to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to help treat victims. The center's 40-bed burn unit has 240 physicians, nurses and support personnel and is the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military's only burn-treatment facility. Among the recent patients of the burn unit were sailors injured during attacks in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> the past 15 months.

 A moderate earthquake jolted northern <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Wednesday, but there were no reports of damage or injuries, officials said. The quake, which was felt as far north as <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, struck at 9:44 a.m. and measured 5.1 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, said <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> <PERSON> Dailey </PERSON>, spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The temblor was centered near <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salada </LOCATION>, a small agricultural community 32 miles south of here and 90 miles southeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dailey </PERSON> said. `` All is normal,'' said <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Haje </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Mexicali </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> training officer. `` The earthquake was very short and there were no accidents or damage,'' he said. `` It was not on any major fault,'' said <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> of the seismology laboratory at <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanography </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jolla </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` It's really of very little significance.

<TEXT>
 Prosecutors began an investigation of the <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION> air show disaster but said Wednesday no criminal charges were likely, and officials said they had mistakenly listed a 4-year-old boy among the dead. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials raised the death count to 52 but the West Germans said their mistake about the badly burned child lowered their toll to 48 killed in the crash Sunday of an Italian jet. West German officials also said up to 30 badly burned survivors may die. There was no reason given for the discrepancy between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and West German figures. The Pentagon has said six of the dead were Americans, but did not release their names. On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> identified one of them as Army Pfc. <PERSON> Genevieve </PERSON> <PERSON> Riggs </PERSON>, 36, of the <ORGANIZATION> 110th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pirmasens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Her husband, Sgt. <PERSON> Myron </PERSON> <PERSON> Riggs </PERSON> of the 110th, was one of four people evacuated Tuesday to the <ORGANIZATION> Brooke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Many grieving families still had not found missing relatives by Wednesday and officials said 138 reports of missing persons remained unresolved. Some badly burned children lay in hospitals, apparently orphaned by the accident. Scores of people were seriously injured when three of 10 low-flying Italian jets collided and one became a fireball that swept into the crowd during the annual air show at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base in <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION>. The three pilots were killed. The Italian air force official who coordinated the team's stunts said one caused the crash by flying into an intersecting maneuver at the wrong altitude and speed. Thousands of townspeople, family members, dignitaries and fellow aviators crowded a small church Wednesday at <LOCATION> Udine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, for the funeral of the pilots _ Lt. Col. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Naldini </PERSON>, 38; Lt. Col. <PERSON> Ivo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nutarelli </PERSON>, 41, and Capt. <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> Alessio </PERSON>, 31. <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dietzen </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Rhineland-Palatinate </LOCATION> state spokesman, said a `` communications mistake'' caused the erroneous report of the boy's death. He would not elaborate. `` That reduces the death toll to 48,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, adding that the 4-year-old was `` seriously injured.'' <PERSON> Dietzen </PERSON> said the bodies of 25 people _ 22 spectators and three pilots _ had been identified and no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens were among them. Two were children, he said. The spokesman, whose state includes <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION>, said 166 people still were hospitalized. Maj. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION> revised figures showed 52 people dead. She did not say whether the 52 included deaths on Wednesday and there was no explanation for the discrepancy in the death counts. A day earlier, the Pentagon said its figures showed 40 people had died, six of them <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens. <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Sattler </PERSON>, chief prosecutor in <LOCATION> Kaiserlautern </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION>, told the AP: `` I have opened an investigation, because under German law there must be a probe into all cases of violent death.'' He said complex legal restrictions involving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> virtually prohibit bringing <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officers before German courts for criminal trial in a case like the <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION> crash. He also said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has no jurisdiction at the <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION> base. `` So, it is highly unlikely that anyone will come before a West German criminal court in this case,'' <PERSON> Sattler </PERSON> said a telephone interview. He added that the same applies to Italians involved with the flying team. <PERSON> Sattler </PERSON> confirmed that two individuals and the local branch of the Greens party had filed criminal complaints alleging negligence. He said one was against Defense Minister <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> and the other directed at `` those responsible.'' He said tests of the surviving Italian pilots for alcohol and drugs were negative but the results on the three who perished were not yet available. Greens party members and others have demanded that <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> resign, contending he should have done something about air shows before the tragedy occurred. He ordered a suspension of military air shows after the crash and said Wednesday his decision also applies to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. `` My decision is based on German law. This is within my right, and also applies to the Allies,'' he told reporters. How far the ban extended has been unclear, but <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> said Wednesday he expects the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies to honor it. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have asked spectators who made still or moving pictures of the accident to lend the material to a special board of investigators trying to determine what went wrong, the unofficial <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military newspaper Stars and Stripes reported.

 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear power plants he inspected are run by businesslike workers, but he could not comment yet on their safety. <PERSON> Lando </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> told a news conference his team of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear experts believes it is too early to form opinions about the state of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear safety. `` We have just started -LRB- U.S.-Soviet exchanges -RRB- so it is inappropriate that we draw conclusions,'' he said. Among the plants visited was Chernobyl, where a reactor explosion April 26, 1986, killed 31 people and sent up a huge, invisible cloud of radioactivity that spread over <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and eventually worked its way around the world. <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Protsenko </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, signed an agreement promising cooperation between the Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governments on promotion of civilian nuclear safety. Nuclear experts from the two governments will exchange information, sponsor joint seminars and regularly visit each other's countries. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> laid the groundwork for the exchanges at their December summit in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` I think and I hope that this will lead to improved nuclear reactor safety in both of our countries,'' <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> said. He said the people he met at the power plants were `` dedicated to safety.'' Delegation members realize the American and Soviet plants have differences in design, construction and procedures, he said, but would not elaborate. `` We are still assessing these differences,'' he said. <PERSON> Protsenko </PERSON> said <PERSON> Zech </PERSON>'s private remarks to him after visiting the nuclear facilities were invariably polite, even when <PERSON> Protsenko </PERSON> discussed what he believed to be inadequacies. `` I found his comments very useful,'' <PERSON> Protsenko </PERSON> said. A similar Soviet delegation will visit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> soon, but <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> said when and what plants they would visit had not been decided.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 jet that crashed Wednesday at <ORGANIZATION> Dallas-Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> had only minor problems in the last five years, according to <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> records. A service difficulty report on file at <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> showed a power controller actuator on a wing flap on the jet had to be replaced in July 1987 after the aileron flap on the plane's right wing jammed. A power controller actuator in the flap was removed and returned to the manufacturer, the records show. A new controller was installed. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, said the actuator is like a small pump that is activated as part of the process of operating the flaps during takeoffs and landings. In August 1983, inspectors found two small cracks in the fuselage skin, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. The first crack measured one-half inch in length at the corner of the pilot's window. The second, found in another inspection the same month, was three-quarters of an inch long at the upper corner of the captain's windshield, the report said. <PERSON> Bobbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mardis </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, described the problems as very minor. Ms. <PERSON> Mardis </PERSON> said the crew was identified as pilot <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, co-pilot <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and flight engineer <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Judd </PERSON>. According to <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> records, none of the crew members had a record of an accident, incident or violation, she said. The aircraft was built by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> in 1973 and delivered new to <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Mardis </PERSON> said the aircraft accident-incident report for the plane showed that on Nov. 13, 1986, at <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, the aircraft did n't stay at the altitude assigned by air traffic controllers. The jetliner was was powered by JT8D engines manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, which sent two investigators to the scene. The engines are a mainstay of the airline industry, according to <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> spokesman. Long said the company routinely sends its investigators to crashes in which aircraft are powered by <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> engines. Long said it was `` way to early'' to speculate on the cause of the crash. `` We're just really collecting information and trying to learn more ourselves. We have learned to wait until the facts come along,'' <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said. The JT8D received its initial certification from the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> in 1967 and about 10,000 are now in use. It provides a thrust at takeoff of 14,000 to 18,000 pounds, according to <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> documents. Problems with JT8D engines were cited as contributing factors in 1985 airline crashes in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday was urged to drop plans to finance a `` Superfund'' study that some environmental groups said would be used by industry to weaken the toxic waste cleanup law. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, supported by other groups, sent <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> a letter saying the Superfund study plan `` usurps the legislative function and is a clear attempt to shift blame for the agency's sorry record.'' <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> plans to give $ 2.5 million to the <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> for a major study of the law under the direction of a steering committee made up of 20 people from industry, the states and four environmental groups. The law comes up for revision in 1991. The steering committee `` includes representatives of industries that want to repeal the cornerstone of the law, the strict joint and several liability standard,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> of the public interest group, an advocacy organization that <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> helped found. `` Taxpayers should not be forced to finance an industry effort to cripple the Superfund law,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. `` Joint and several'' liability means that any company found to have contributed to dumping, no matter how small the amount, could be held responsible for the entire cleanup cost. EPA has often called the provision an indispensable tool in its enforcement efforts. The four groups asked to take part were the Environmental Defense Fund, the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. The fund said it had not decided whether to participate, key officials at the council and the society were away from their offices and the club said it did not expect to participate. <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> lobbyist <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> <PERSON> Early </PERSON> said the club would like to have the study `` redirected to focus on the problems <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has had in implementing the law and not whether <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did the right thing.'' <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, assistant <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator for policy, planning and evaluation, said: `` No one in this agency would ever give up joint and several liability. It goes to the core not only of Superfund, but hazardous waste management in general.'' She said the Superfund study will examine `` how it's being implemented, how you can increase state cleanups and how you can increase private party cleanups.'' Joining <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s group in the request to <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> were the Clean Water Action Project, Citizen Action, Environmental Action, the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, Friends of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toxics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION>, Public Citizen, the <LOCATION> Rainbow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lobby </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> Toxics Campaign.

 <LOCATION> OKEECHOBEE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -LRB- A -RRB- _ Streetwise New Yorker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Alpern </PERSON> knows more about urban sharks than swamp alligators, but that's about to change as he takes to the waters of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Okeechobee </LOCATION> on Thursday in the first statewide gator hunt in 26 years. `` This guy does n't know an airboat from an air hose,'' said professional gator-hunter <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>, who will serve as <PERSON> Alpern </PERSON>'s guide `` I'm here to make sure we get the gators, not vice versa.'' Beginning at sundown Thursday, the two men will head out onto the lake as the most unusual and celebrated of the 238 participants in the gator hunt, which was organized in response to a growing alligator population estimated at 1 million. Former Ivy Leaguer <PERSON> Alpern </PERSON>, 25, acknowledged with a tip of his <ORGANIZATION> Mets </ORGANIZATION>' baseball cap that he is enjoying his well-publicized role as the only Northerner among the hunters. `` They all think I'm a bit strange,'' said <PERSON> Alpern </PERSON>, who left his loft apartment in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> on Tuesday. `` You know, the city boy out in the country sort of thing. I'm just taking it all in.'' He has caught the attention of the major television networks and nearly every large newspaper in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Last week, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> environmental officials gave <PERSON> Alpern </PERSON> a T-shirt decorated with a sunglasses-wearing alligator climbing out of a city sewer, in jest of the tales of freed pet alligators roaming beneath the streets. `` It's all been an adventure in itself. I never thought I'd be a newsmaker,'' he said. `` But I like doing odd things, so I guess it just comes with the territory.'' <PERSON> Alpern </PERSON>, a free-lance writer and aspiring race-car driver, said he contacted <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> game officials in May after reading about the hunt in a magazine. <PERSON> Alpern </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bart </PERSON> <PERSON> McBeth </PERSON> of Sulphur, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, were the only two out-of-state residents randomly selected from about 5,000 applications to participate in the monthlong season. <PERSON> McBeth </PERSON> could not be reached by telephone Wednesday to confirm he will join the hunt. <PERSON> Alpern </PERSON>, who will be allowed to take 15 gators with his permit, said he selected <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>, 51, as a guide after learning the danger in gator hunting. `` I've never hunted anything except a bird I shot with a BB gun as a kid,'' said <PERSON> Alpern </PERSON>, who has practiced on a shooting range, however, and will take his practice gun with him on the hunt. <PERSON> Alpern </PERSON> left <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1982 after one year of classes and is working on a bachelor's degree at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Between schools, he devoted himself to auto racing. In 1985, the last time he was in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, he crashed his Formula Ford race car at a track. He spent the next year racing in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and trying to develop a new British-Italian Formula 3 car. Later, back in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, he began helicopter lessons. On Wednesday, he got some ideas of what he can expect to earn on his adventure into the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>. On a white legal pad, <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> rapidly tallied some figures: take 15 gators, subtract money for <PERSON> Alpern </PERSON>'s $ 1,000 out-of-state permit and $ 75 each for processing and other expenses, and it leaves about $ 4,000 in potential profits from the sale of the carcasses. <PERSON> Alpern </PERSON> thought for a moment and proposed an even split. A handshake consummated the deal.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said Wednesday it may suspend or terminate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty unless the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> dismantles a Siberian radar complex. A statement from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation to a week-long conference that reviewed the agreement left no doubt that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was dissatisfied with the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> response to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concerns about the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar installation. The statement said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has `` made clear that the continuing existence of the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar makes it impossible to conclude any future arms agreements in the START or defense and space areas.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration would continue efforts for a treaty on limiting long-range nuclear forces, known as START, but said there was little prospect of doing so before President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves office in January. `` We are still meeting in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> and still working toward a START treaty ... in the hope that it -LRB- the Soviet radar -RRB- will be dismantled in the interim,'' he said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, with the vacationing president. Negotiations on limiting intercontinental nuclear forces and on space and defense systems are separate, parallel talks that have continued in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> since March 1985. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> made no immediate comment but the chief Soviet delegate, <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>, scheduled a news conference for Thursday. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team was led by the director of the <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> statement said that during the review conference, the third of its kind, `` the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> gave no indication that it was prepared to correct the violations -LRB- of the ABM treaty -RRB- without linking their agreement to do so to unacceptable demands.'' The statement referred to the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar installation, which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for years has been saying violates the ABM treaty because of its location and orientation. It said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side also raised the question of two other radars that the Soviets deployed last year in <LOCATION> Gomel </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>. The ABM treaty limits each side to deploying one ABM system comprising a radar and anti-ballistic missiles. It also constrains early warning radars which could, because of their location, orientation and capability, contribute to an ABM defense. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side charges that the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar is such an installation. `` The <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> violation is very serious, particularly when it is recognized that the radar constitutes one of a network of such radars that have the inherent potential for attack assessment in support of ballistic missile defense,'' the statement said. The aim of the ABM treaty is to prevent either side from creating a nationwide protective network, under the theory that neither side would launch a nuclear attack if there was a possibility of devastating retaliation. <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> said in July that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would dismantle the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar equipment, but not the building housing it, if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreed to renew its commitment to the ABM treaty for at least 10 years. But the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says the entire installation must be scrapped. `` Since the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was not prepared to satisfy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concerns'' during the review conference `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will have to consider declaring this continuing violation a material breach of the treaty,'' the statement said. An information sheet distributed last week by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mission says that according to the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> Convention on the Law of Treaties, if one party charges `` material breach'' it is entitled to invoke the breach `` as a ground for terminating the treaty or suspending its operation in whole or in part.'' Such a move would apparently free the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to conduct uninhibited research and deployment of its proposed space-based missile defense system, known officially as the Strategic Defense Initiative and popularly called `` Star Wars.'' The Soviets say some of the research violates the ABM treaty. They have long said that a limit on the research is a prerequisite for a START treaty, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has rejected such a linkage.

 <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s auditor general has issued a summons for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> to seek information on a 1984 state contract for dump trucks said to be bad buys. The summons, filed in <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, orders <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> governor, to testify before Auditor General <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>. A spokesman for <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, said the summons was prompted by political motives. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> is a Republican, <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> a Democrat. `` It would normally be -LRB- <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s -RRB- intent to cooperate with any legitimate questions having to do with his administration. But this is absurd ... and Mr. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> knows it,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, who is seeking re-election, raised the contract issue earlier this month in a statement submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciairy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which reviewed <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s nomination to replace <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> as attorney general. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said the matter has been fully investigated by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, the state attorney general and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office and no problems have been found. A spokesman with the state attorney general's office said the matter was still under review. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>, acting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, said the case is not formally closed but officials are not actively investigating it. The $ 23 million contract for 428 dump trucks was awarded when <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> was in his second term as <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> governor. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> has previously criticized the contract, saying the state paid too much for underpowered trucks. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, in a telephone interview, said efforts to meet with <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> have been unsuccessful. As auditor general, <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> is authorized to gather information on state matters under his jurisdiction, such as contracts, but can not prosecute if he finds evidence of wrongdoing. Such information would have to be forwarded to appropriate agencies, such as the state attorney general. However, he can issue summonses to compel testimony in matters under review.

Release</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Jailed black nationalist <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has been moved from a hospital to a private clinic while he recuperates from tuberculosis, the government said Thursday. The move sets the stage for a possible release from government custody. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, 70, was transferred on Aug. 12 from <LOCATION> Pollsmoor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION>, to nearby <LOCATION> Tygerberg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where he was diagnosed with the disease. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, leader of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, has been in prison for 26 years. He has been making a speedy recovery from his illness, his doctors have said, and was moved late Wednesday night to the <ORGANIZATION> Constantiaberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, a spokesman for the prison service, <PERSON> Danie </PERSON> <PERSON> Immelman </PERSON>, told the independent <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s condition has improved to such an extent that his further treatment in the <LOCATION> Tygerberg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> was no longer necessary,'' <PERSON> Immelman </PERSON> was quoted as saying. The spokesman gave no indication of how long would be in the clinic or what the conditions of his stay would be like. The move appears to confirm widespread speculation that <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> would be placed in a private clinic and gradually reintroduced to the South African public before the government decides whether to release him outright. Under this widely accepted scenario, <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> is expected to have access to a greater number of visitors and possibly even allowed to conduct media interviews. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s full recuperation is likely to at least several weeks and after that period, the government can then choose whether to send him back to prison or grant him freedom. President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, in a major speech two weeks ago, said he was seriously considering releasing <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, the country's best-known black leader <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white-led government. His continued imprisonment has the government in a difficult bind. If <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> releases <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, the president risks an enormous white backlash and the possibility of reactivating militant black opposition that has been largely suppressed under the 26-month-old state of emergency. If <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> keeps <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> in prison, there could be widespread black unrest if the country's preeminent black leader dies in prison. Nationwide municipal elections are set for Oct. 26, further complicating <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s dilemma. The government is engaged in a massive campaign to encourage blacks to vote in municipal township elections, but it also faces a growing threat from conservative whites. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s release would likely encourage black voters to go to the polls, but could harm <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s national party in the separate white local elections. The different race groups vote in separate local elections but the nation's black majority has no vote in national affairs. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has offered since 1985 to release <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> if he will renounce violence. However, <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has said that the government's 1960 decision to ban the then-peaceful <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> left him no choice but to fight <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has said he will disavow violence only if the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is not longer banned, apartheid is dismantled and blacks are given a voice in national affairs.

<HEAD>Plan Under Consideration Would Change Custody Of Truant Students</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Parents of students who are chronically truant could lose custody of their children under a plan being considered by school and court officials. A proposal to have schools report the names of chronic truants to the courts, who would consider transferring custody to a grandparent or other relative, quickly drew fire from legal aid lawyers. Critics said it appeared to be an extreme way to deal with absenteeism and threatens student confidentiality. Probate Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON>, who met last week with School Superintendent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to discuss the proposal, said it could be undertaken legally. The idea is still in the planning stages, officials said. <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON> said the idea grew out of a conversation he had in July with Dow about parents who abuse drugs and do n't send their children to school regularly. Dow proposed a mechanism of reporting truancy to the courts, and having a probate judge inquire into the family situation, <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON> said removing a child from parents' custody would require much more than just showing he or she missed school. There would have to be other signs of neglect, he said. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Knierim </PERSON>, state administrator for probate courts, called the proposal an `` innovative approach to a serious problem.'' But lawyers who defend poor people were critical. `` You ca n't assume parent neglect because the child is absent a lot,'' said <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, a lawyer with New Haven Legal Assistance. `` It could be that the child is not in an appropriate educational program, or other children are picking on him or her in school, or there may be family problems at home.'' <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON> <PERSON> Geballe </PERSON>, supervising attorney at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION> schools have repeatedly cited federal law prohibiting disclosure of student names when declining to comment on school problems. `` Volunteering student names in the absence of a subpoena from the court I find ironic, to say the least,'' she said. Deputy Superintendent of Schools <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Quezada </PERSON> said the school system will work with lawyers to determine how to pass on information to the court while maintaining student confidentiality. Any new policy would require school board approval, she said. The absenteeism rate has remained stable in recent years, <PERSON> Quezada </PERSON> said, but school officials have been alarmed by figures showing that 35 percent of the fourth-graders who failed a state standardized test last year had excessive absenteeism.

<HEAD>Postal Service, Union Sign Pact To Reduce Grievances</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

 The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Letter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carriers </ORGANIZATION> signed a `` joint commitment'' Wednesday to cut by half thousands of expensive grievance appeals, arbitrations and employment discrimination complaints annually. The non-binding agreement to improve the labor-management climate is the first ever signed by the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> with a union representing its employees. According to <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> records, 19,543 grievances were appealed beyond the local level by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Letter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carriers </ORGANIZATION> union in the 12 months ending Aug. 1, and 10,766 individual disputes were taken to arbitration. In addition, members of the union filed 2,128 complaints of age, sex or race discrimination against the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> with the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The two-page accord said a joint employee involvement process by the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the 310,000-member union has improved labor-management relations over the past five years. However, it added that `` tension and antagonism remain at an intolerable level in many work locations ... and the number of grievances filed and arbitrations conducted is unacceptable.'' The accord was worked out after Postmaster General <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> became the first person ever holding that post to address a postal union convention when he spoke to the Letter Carriers last month in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION> `` These processes ... break down the old ` them' and ` us' attitudes and promote a positive spirit of cooperation,'' he said `` In short they save money for both sides, improve productivity -LRB- and -RRB- reduce workplace stress.'' Postal Service officials said the cooperation agreement does not alter any terms of a 40-month labor contract signed last summer.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general could not break a stalemate in the Iran-Iraq peace talks, but said Wednesday he would make one last try to arrange a meeting between the two nations before his departure. Meanwhile, Iranian leaders called for volunteers for the front in the war that has taken up to 1 million lives since it began in September 1980. A cease-fire took effect Aug. 20 and the peace talks started five days later. <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, the secretary-general, continued trying until late Wednesday night `` to arrange a meeting even at two or three in the morning'' between the chief diplomats of the two countries, his spokesman, <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> had no luck and would try again Thursday morning. He is scheduled to leave for <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> in the afternoon. `` The secretary-general is frustrated by the slow progress of the talks and the inability to reach the necessary compromise,'' <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said earlier. In <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s deputy head of the military <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in charge of manpower called for continuing mobilization and said Iranians at the front must extend their period of service. <PERSON> Alireza </PERSON> <PERSON> Afshar </PERSON>, the deputy, was quoted by the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> as saying Iranians have been ordered to remain on alert `` in order to foil the enemies' plots.'' The report was monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> told his nation, `` We must take it that we are still at war.'' <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said said <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> had been `` putting forward new formulations constantly'' to overcome the difficulties. Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> and his Iraqi counterpart <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> have not met face-to-face since Friday. The talks have been conducted since then on lower levels as the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief sought a compromise to bridge differences over the Shatt-Al-Arab waterway and other issues. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s news agency also quoted President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> as saying <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would not submit to any blackmail by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> during the peace talks. He reiterated that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would not accede to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s demand for sovereignty over the <LOCATION> Shatt-al-Arab </LOCATION> waterway, which forms part of the southern border between the two nations. The agency quoted Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> as calling the slow pace of thetalks `` unsatisfactory'' and accusing <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of procrastination. It gave few details of his remarks. `` What we have all to keep in mind is that time is running out and I have other commitments,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said as he entered the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> office early Wednesday. `` I hope that today we will make some significant progress _ I hope.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief is to leave Thursday for <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, then go to <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hague </LOCATION> on Monday. It was not certain whether he would return between appointments, but <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said he would return if necessary. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> hoped to name a special representative on Thursday to conduct the talks in his absence. `` As an honest broker, I have to go from one side to another proposing ideas and new formulas which could be a real compromise, not necessarily 100 percent concessions, but a real compromise by both sides,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said. Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition they not be identified, said no concrete proposals have been made regarding troop withdrawals and <LOCATION> Shatt-al-Arab </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s only outlet to the sea. They said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> effort is directed at arranging the beginning of troop withdrawals from the front and keeping the question of sovereignty over Shatt-al-Arab from impeding progress on other issues. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> wants to control the entire waterway, while <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> insists that it be divided, as specified in a 1975 treaty. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has repudiated that treaty. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said Tuesday his government never would make concessions to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, and both sides accused each other of blocking progress. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said Tuesday, `` We are trying to clear the first part ... on an immediate cease-fire and a withdrawal without delay and ... the cease-fire at sea is part of the problem.'' Both <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have attacked shipping in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> during the war. <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> said Monday that the talks were at `` square one'' and there had been no substantive discussion of what the cease-fire covered. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was `` raising a lot of preconditions,'' including clearing the waterway, which is choked with silt and sunken ships. But he said there was no deadlock. Both <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> said they would remain in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> as long as necessary.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s allies in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> approved free-trade legislation Wednesday to eliminate economic barriers with <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But members of the opposition-dominated <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> say they will stall the bill. With both sides waving <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> flags and the opposition singing the national anthem, the Commons voted 177-64 for the agreement signed in January by <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The Progressive Conservatives, with 207 of the 282 seats in the Commons, easily out-voted the combined opposition and sent the bill to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The Liberals and New Democrats, who call the trade deal a sellout of Canadian sovereignty, interrupted the final vote by singing `` O <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>.'' During two raucous votes on opposition amendments, Speaker <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> admonished members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to settle down and asked New Democrats and Conservatives alike to put down their Canadian flags and pins. But the bill, which would amend 27 federal statutes to make <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s border more open to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> goods and services, faces a rough road ahead. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> has suggested strongly that he will call a federal election this fall before the scheduled Jan. 1 launch of the trade treaty. And the Liberal majority in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has promised to stall the legislation until the issue is decided one way or another in an election. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> legislation on the treaty has been approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> and is expected to pass the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> later this month. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s deputy chief trade negotiator over the two years of talks with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said the agreement will not be in effect until the deal gets through the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the prime minister actually exchanges a letter of ratification with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> president. `` We're saving the champagne for the ratification,'' said <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON>. Public opinion surveys indicate Canadians are almost equally divided on the merits of the agreement but generally agree on thing _ the issue is confusing. Under the trade agreement, both countries would begin phasing out border taxes, quotas, standards and other regulations that stop or discourge trade. Future disputes could be referred to five-member panels of trade experts from both countries for settlement. The Canadian government has touted the deal as a boon for business and jobs as well as cutting the $ 2 billion a year in tariffs that Canadian businesses and consumers have to pay on imports from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The opposition says other Canadian jobs will be lost as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business moves into the Canadian market. Consumers will only see a fraction of the value of the tariff cuts, they say. The agreement was reached last fall after 18 months of talks between the two nations.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> did not violate the civil rights of actress <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON> <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON> when it canceled her performances following threats by protesters, a federal appeals court ruled Wednesday. The full <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 1st </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled by a 3-2 vote that the cancellation did not violate the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Civil Rights Act. It was an unusual reversal of an earlier finding by a three-member panel of the appellate court. Wednesday's decision reinstated an award to compensate Ms. <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON> $ 12,000 she would have earned in a Broadway role she lost during the suit against the symphony. However, expenses the actress would have incurred while appearing in the play will be subtracted from the award. Orchestra attorney <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said symphony officials were relieved with the ruling. `` I think they're also happy that the case is probably over now and they can go back to doing what they're best at _ making music,'' he said. Attorneys for Ms. <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON>, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kornstein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Wexler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, were not in their offices and did not return calls Wednesday evening. Ms. <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON> was hired by the symphony in 1982 to narrate six performances of <PERSON> Stravinsky </PERSON>'s `` Oedipus Rex'' at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tanglewood </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Carnegie Hall. But the contract was canceled after the symphony received letters and telephone calls indicating there would be picketing and other protests because of Ms. <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON>'s support of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. In November 1984, a federal jury ruled the symphony had breached its contract with Ms. <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON> and awarded her the $ 27,500 she was to have received for the performances plus $ 100,000 in compensatory damages for work the actress said she lost because of the action. In February 1985, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> threw out the $ 100,000 award and ruled the symphony had not violated her civil rights. Last October, a three-member panel of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 1st </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> restored $ 12,000 of that award as compensation for the lost role. The three-member panel also found the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Civil Rights Act had been violated. Attorneys for the symphony, arguing that <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> law allowed them to cancel performances because of concerns that threatened disruptions would mar the artistic integrity of the performances, asked for a rehearing before the full court. Wednesday's ruling by the full court, effectively reversing the earlier finding, was unusual, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. `` This is a very, very rare thing,'' he said. `` The 1st Circuit very seldom reverses themselves.''

 Plenty of sunshine made it a wonderful day across most of the country Wednesday, with temperatures in the 80s in the southern and central <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and in the 60s and 70s in the north. A high pressure system centered over northern <LOCATION> Ohio-Pennsylvania </LOCATION> border brought clear skies and dry air to an area stretching from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> into the southern Plains. Another high pressure system over southwest British <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> provided a pleasant day in the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, with afternoon temperatures in the 60s and 70s. Gusty winds developed in the <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, blowing from 20 to 35 mph across parts of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. Rainfall was restricted to southern coastal areas along the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, with showers and thunderstorms scattered across <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and westward along the Gulf coast as far as southernmost <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. There also were scattered showers in east-central <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and west-central <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. In the desert <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, it was anothger scorching day, with the mercury rising over 100 in parts of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 59 degrees at <LOCATION> Crescent </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to 106 degrees at <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The nation's low early Wednesday was 35 degrees at Butte, Mont. Thursday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms scattered from the southern <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> states and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> across the Gulf coast into the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION> and over the central and southern Plains. Showers and thunderstorms were expected to develop along a cold front over <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> and northwest <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. The rest of the nation can expect mostly sunny skies.

 Some of the passengers who survived the crash of a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet on Wednesday may owe their lives to another crash three years ago, rescuers said. `` Last time we did n't know what to expect. This time we're a little more organized,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Cartier </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> volunteer. `` Last time'' was the crash of <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Flight 191, a <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> L-1011, on the other side of <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> three years ago in which 137 people died. `` Flight 191 definitely gave us more experience,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Sympson </PERSON>, paramedic supervisor for the airport police and fire department. `` When we got here, it was click, click, click.'' `` There was a lot of preparation done because of the last one,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Muncy </PERSON>, a lab technician at the 314-bed Harris Methodist H.E.B. Hospital, where many of the injured were taken. `` Everyone was right in place. There was no wasted motion. We knew just what to do.'' <PERSON> Sympson </PERSON> arrived aboard one of the first three emergency vehicles at the crash scene just three minutes after the 9:03 a.m. accident at the airport's west end. Dozens of fire trucks, helicopters and police vehicles converged on the prairie southwest of the main airport tower, and within 10 minutes some of the first victims were being transported to hospitals, <PERSON> Sympson </PERSON> said. `` When we got to the plane, the majority of the survivors were on the grass, away from the plane,'' <PERSON> Sympson </PERSON> said. A van driver, <PERSON> Eusebio </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON>, said he was several hundred yards away when the plane cracked open and a column of flame erupted from the tail area. <PERSON> Sympson </PERSON> and others in the first wave of rescuers concentrated on establishing a triage area where survivors could be evaluated and the most seriously injured expedited to hospitals. The paramedics said all they were told only that the plane was a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727. It was n't until thick, black smoke cleared 15 or 20 minutes later that they discovered they were working on another <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> plane. When paramedic <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON> arrived on the scene, `` all I heard was screaming from the people on the ground.'' `` Some of them -LRB- the survivors -RRB- were in severe shock, but some of them were joking, trying to I guess make the situation easier,'' <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON> said. `` One guy laughed and said, ` Boy, I'm not going to take an airplane home.' Ca n't really blame him at that point.'' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>, an airport Department of Public Safety officer, was off duty when he heard about the crash on the news and came in to work about 9:40 a.m. `` I just helped pull bodies out _ about nine,'' said <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>. `` They were charred. Some of them were in seats. Some of them were n't in seats. Some had belts on we had to take off. `` The ones that I pulled out were in the back of the plane,'' he said. <PERSON> Sympson </PERSON> said this crash was similar to the one three years ago. `` There was not a big difference,'' <PERSON> Sympson </PERSON> said. `` There was fire, smoke and you did n't know what you were going to find. I'm simply amazed there were this many survivors. Paramedic <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Seadore </PERSON> said he was the first paramedic to arrive at both crashes. `` I tell you I had some flashbacks,'' <PERSON> Seadore </PERSON> said of Wednesday's disaster. One result of the 1985 crash was a greater emphasis on helping rescuers cope with what they saw and had to do when they arrived to help Wednesday. <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>, still wearing his silver flame-proof coveralls and hard hat, said those who helped pull victims from the plane were sent to a stress center where they received tetanus shots. Then they were taken to a stress clinic for counseling. `` Anyone who pulled out bodies went through that,'' he said. `` You never get used to it. But you got a job to do, and you just go ahead and do it.'' Hundreds of people were on hand at the crash site within an hour after the accident. Within two hours, volunteers from charitable agencies had arrived to provide food and beverages to workers in what was expected to be a day-long effort. `` We work with relatives and victims, ensuring they've got nurses, preachers to talk to, and we meet their transportation needs by taking them to the hospitals and hotels,'' <PERSON> Cartier </PERSON> said.

 An <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bomb exploded by mistake Wednesday in an apartment where a booby trap had been set for British soldiers, killing an elderly man and a woman. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> apologized for the trap that went `` tragically wrong.'' The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> has killed 20 civilians unintentionally since November and has apologized repeatedly. Also Wednesday, police said three men killed in a British army ambush Tuesday were armed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> terrorists armed and dressed for a possible attack. The ambush was seen as the start of a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> crackdown on the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which wants to unite the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> province with the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Irish Republic under socialist rule. On Wednesday night, gangs of youths in Catholic enclaves of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> hijacked 30 vehicles and set several on fire, said a police spokesman. Meanwhile, the <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> called for an urgent meeting with <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> officials under terms of the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, which gives the republic a consultative role in the affairs of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. `` The frightening escalation of violence undermines the very maintenance of the rule of law, and can only bring further divisions and tragedy for the people of the north,'' said a statement by Irish Prime Minister <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> and his Cabinet. West German police captured two heavily armed suspected <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas heading toward a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> barracks shortly after midnight Tuesday after they drove through a remote border crossing from the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. The apartment bomb in <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>, about 60 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, was triggered by an elderly man who climbed through a window, worried that the young man living there had not been seen for several days, police said. The blast demolished the apartment, killing an elderly man and a woman standing outside and injuring another man, said spokesman Sgt. <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Winters </PERSON>. An <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> statement and the police account indicated the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> abducted the apartment's occupants several days ago and planted the booby trap, hoping an army search party would enter the apartment and trigger the explosives. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION> unit apologized in a statement circulated to the news media. `` Although the operation was carefully planned, it went tragically wrong,'' it said. `` At no stage, unfortunately, was it anticipated that a member of the public would enter the flat through a front window and open a booby-trapped door.'' This summer, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> has escalated its war to drive the British from the province, killing 27 British military men in attacks in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, elsewhere in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and in continental <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The three killed Tuesday were attacked while on a country road at <LOCATION> Drumnakilly </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tyrone </LOCATION>, eight miles from <LOCATION> Ballygawley </LOCATION>, where an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bomb on Aug. 20 killed eight soldiers in a bus. It was that attack, the bloodiest this year, that prompted a British government pledge to crack down on the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said the three were members on `` active service,'' the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> term for a guerrilla mission. The British news media speculated that the <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, the country's best-trained anti-guerrilla squad, ambushed the men. They quoted witnesses as saying they saw men in civilian clothes being ferried away by military helicopter immediately after the shooting. Police said the three wore the typical <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> outfit of overalls, gloves and ski masks and that two rifles and a handgun were found in their bullet-riddled car. British press reports said the three were preparing to assassinate a soldier of the locally recruited <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION>, but the police and army refused comment. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> never confirms involvement by the <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, but several <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> deaths in recent years have been attributed to the clandestine unit. They include three unarmed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members shot March 6 in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>, where they allegedly planned a car-bomb attack. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> has lost 11 members this year. The province's police force, the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> and brothers <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Harte </PERSON> were hardened <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> operatives who were often arrested but never charged. It said <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Harte </PERSON> commanded the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s mid-Tyrone unit and was `` a ruthless, dedicated terrorist'' who from 1983 organized `` terrorist operations mainly against members of the security forces in the mid-Tyrone area.'' His brother, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, `` played a prominent role in terrorist operations,'' while <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> was active in the <LOCATION> Omagh </LOCATION> area, the statement said. British news reports said <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> was <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Harte </PERSON>'s brother-in-law and one of eight men detained after the bus bombing The eight were questioned for five days and released. <PERSON> Seamus </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallon </PERSON>, deputy leader of the moderate <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the three died in `` controversial circumstances.'' <PERSON> Mallon </PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> would have to say whether troops made any attempt to arrest them. The Protestant Rev. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, leader of the militant <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said he was glad security forces were `` going on the offensive.'' The two suspected <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas arrested in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had driven over the Dutch border into the northwestern part of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> by using a remote country lane off limits to traffic between the two countries, police said.

 Former Mayor <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Roark </PERSON>, battling to save his law license after pleading guilty to drug charges, admitted to a Bar panel Wednesday that he took no action while prosecutor against two men who sold him drugs. <PERSON> Roark </PERSON>, who turned 43 on Wednesday, testified for about 25 minutes before a subcommittee of the state Bar's <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. It is considering whether sanctions should be imposed, up to revocation of <PERSON> Roark </PERSON>'s law license, because of his guilty pleas. <PERSON> Roark </PERSON> pleaded guilty to six misdemeanor federal charges of possession of cocaine and resigned as mayor as part of the plea agreement. He was released from federal prison on July 20 after serving 5 -LCB- months. Ethics panel chairman <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Recht </PERSON> said the central issue at the hearing is whether a public official should be treated differently in a disciplinary matter from lawyers in private practice. <PERSON> Roark </PERSON>'s side said he should not and asked for leniency. But Bar disciplinary counsel <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Marden </PERSON> argued that <PERSON> Roark </PERSON> used his position to shield those supplying drugs. Under cross-examination, <PERSON> Marden </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Roark </PERSON>, who admitted using drugs while <LOCATION> Kanawha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor, whether he tried to bring charges against two men who supplied drugs to him and were convicted by federal prosecutors. `` I took no steps to prosecute either or advise anybody,'' <PERSON> Roark </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Kanawha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, both top assistants to <PERSON> Roark </PERSON> when he was prosecutor, said <PERSON> Roark </PERSON> showed no leniency toward drug dealers. But <PERSON> King </PERSON> said he could not recall <PERSON> Roark </PERSON> participating in any drug prosecutions. The state Bar rested its case against <PERSON> Roark </PERSON> without calling a witness. On the stand, <PERSON> Roark </PERSON> took full blame for his actions and said he was sorry for what had happened. `` I have no excuses and I offer none,'' said <PERSON> Roark </PERSON>, who has been practicing law since his release from prison. `` I obviously knew what I was doing was wrong at the time I was doing it.'' But <PERSON> Roark </PERSON> said he believes that he has paid and pays daily for his actions. He asked the panel to allow him to maintain his law license so he can make restitution to the community for his misbehavior. <PERSON> Recht </PERSON> said the panel should render a decision sometime in October. Its recommendation goes to the full <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which makes its final report to the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The court can then agree to the recommendation, modify or reject it. Former <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckalew </PERSON>, called on behalf of the <PERSON> Roark </PERSON>, testified Wednesday that <PERSON> Roark </PERSON> never attempted to interfere with his agency. <PERSON> Buckalew </PERSON> said his drug officers generally worked under federal supervision and he had little control over them anyway. But he did say that in 1985 he was aware that <PERSON> Roark </PERSON> was being investigated concerning drug matters. `` Did <PERSON> Roark </PERSON> try to curtail drug enforcement?'' asked <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roark </PERSON>'s attorney. `` No, he did not,'' replied <PERSON> Buckalew </PERSON>, police chief from 1983 to 1985. On cross-examination, <PERSON> Marden </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Buckalew </PERSON> whether <PERSON> Roark </PERSON> had ever lied to him. `` Yes, he did,'' <PERSON> Buckalew </PERSON> said. `` He was not truthful as to his plea of guilty to cocaine use. He indicated to me he was not using it.''

 Plans for the <ORGANIZATION> Ronald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> hit a snag Wednesday when questions were raised at an environmental hearing about the project's effects on air quality, plant life and traffic congestion. The Ventura County Environmental Report Review recessed the hearing for a week to get more information. At next week's meeting, the committee could either approve the library project, delay a decision again or decide that an Environmental Impact Report is needed. The <ORGANIZATION> Ronald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> wants to build the library on a 100-acre site which lies partly within a greenbelt area that is protected from large-scale development by a decade-old, non-binding agreement among the communities of <LOCATION> Moorpark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Simi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thousand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION>. The library, scheduled for completion in 1991, would house President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s White House papers and would contain museum exhibits about his administration. Like the eight existing presidential libraries, it would be built with private funds and then operated by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, who represents the county <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pollution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> on the seven-member committee, asked for the delay, saying the district had found the project inconsistent with county air quality standards. `` It would bring in a lot of additional traffic that is not projected,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. The foundation estimates that the library would attract 350,000 visitors a year. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, a private environmental group in <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, said, however, it believed the number of visitors per year could exceed 425,000. `` I think I would have to come down against it'' if the matter were voted on without further investigation, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> told the committee. Other members of the committee said they needed more information on traffic density and the effect on vegetation before making a decision. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Worthley </PERSON>, regional manager of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> and Game, wrote to county officials on May 12 that an undisclosed number of specimens of three `` sensitive plant species'' would be harmed or destroyed by construction. He suggested a detailed site survey `` at the appropriate time of year when these plants can be readily identified and that the project be redesigned to avoid these areas as much as possible.'' <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gatch </PERSON>, director of planning and community development for Thousand Oaks, said in a letter written Tuesday that part of the public road over which traffic would travel to reach the library site `` remains a two-lane roadway operating at a level of service beyond its current capacity.'' Others at the hearing said they understood this section was to be widened before the scheduled 1991 opening of the library. If the project is approved by the committee, critics would have 10 days in which to appeal. The committee would hear the appeal in another 30 days. If an Environmental Impact Report is required, it could take a year or more. The foundation, which hopes to break ground for the library this fall, would have the right to appeal any decision to order an Environmental Impact Report.

 Top aides to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> denied Wednesday that they told <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> not to campaign in several states as tension between the two Democrats increased. Sources close to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said the former presidential candidate was angered at being told to avoid campaigning in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. The sources said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> officials had determined <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> could hurt the ticket among traditionally Democratic blue collar voters in some states who supported <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1980 and 1984. `` I am aware of no list of states provided to him, of states he should not or would not or we prefer he not go into,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>. But one aide to the Democratic nominee, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the campaign conducted polling in every state for favorable and unfavorable opinions on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` to see how well he can do in the fall in attracting swing voters as well as blacks.'' The results found that in some of the primary states he won, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had high negatives among those swing voters. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is making a strong bid to woo those so-called <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> <PERSON> Democrats </PERSON> back to their former allegiance to Democratic presidential candidates. In <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> State Rep. <PERSON> Roscoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has invited him and other key supporters to a meeting Thursday in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>.

According to one participant in the discussions, who asked not to be identified, the request was withdrawn. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> agreed he would stay out of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, but will campaign in the other states. The former civil rights activist won the Democratic contests in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and finished ahead of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Corrigan </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign aide who participated in that meeting, said no suggestion was made that he stay out of those states. `` States were discussed,'' said <PERSON> Corrigan </PERSON>, but he denied it was in the context of places where <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> could hurt the ticket. <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> staff were working with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> aides to `` establish a schedule, how best to use his limited time.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Brazile </PERSON>, who was not in the Thursday meeting but works on minority outreach for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> forces have been scrupulous in contacting <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> officials in every state. `` In many ways our relationship and treatment of Reverend <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> translates into black enthusiasm ... On the other hand, we have to have a local strategy that involves the black community,'' she said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made a pact at the Democratic convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in July that essentially was designed to give the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> constituency and its issues a voice in the Democratic general election campaign, including transferring some of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s aides and advisers to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brazile </PERSON> acknowledged that only two <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> aides have been incorprated into the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> national staff, but said that on the state and local level many former <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> officials have been brought into the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign.

 Three years after a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> jet crashed on takeoff in a severe thunderstorm at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, a federal court battle continues over responsibility for the accident. On Aug. 2, 1985, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Flight 191 crashed and burned, killing 137 people and injuring 25 others. In Wednesday's crash of Flight 1141 on takeoff in cloudless skies for <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, 13 people were killed and 94 survived. The plane went down at the opposite end of the airport from the 1985 crash. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigators ruled in July 1986 that the Delta 191 crash occurred when the L-1101 flew into a microburst containing several wind shears. The strong, abrupt downward shifts in wind direction at the south end of the airport smashed the jet into the ground. Lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> and the government are continuing a 6-month-old federal trial in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> to determine responsibility. Earlier this month, testimony was postponed until October while a federal judge tries to clear other cases. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, which initially admitted some responsibility for the crash, claims government air traffic controllers and weather forecasters failed to warn the flight crew of the storm. The trial involving <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, its insurers and the widow of the pilot is the first in which a major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline has gone to court against the government to seek damages. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> officials claim the government should bear responsibility for the crash and pay all or part of more than $ 90 million in death, injury and damage claims the airline already has paid. More than 90 lawsuits seeking more than $ 200 million dollars were filed by victims' relatives. Lawyers for the government contend the flight crew should have been able to avoid the crash. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> faulted crew training for handling wind shears and the lack of `` definitive'' weather information as contributing factors in the accident. But the Atlanta-based airline maintains the board's findings were `` incomplete, inaccurate and most painfully flawed.'' Officials said the crew operated the craft in accordance with <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> procedures and regulations.

 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> called on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s striking workers Wednesday night to settle their local grievances and end the country's worst labor unrest in seven years. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> made the appeal hours after meeting with government leaders on the wave of strikes that began Aug. 16 calling for higher wages and the legalization of Solidarity. He said the national issues of guaranteeing trade union pluralism and legalizing his outlawed trade federation would be taken up in round-table discussions promised by the government in the near future, according to a statement read by an aide, <PERSON> Piotr </PERSON> <PERSON> Konopka </PERSON>. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he raised the importance of Solidarity in his three-hour meeting with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s interior minister, Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> _ his first with government leaders in six years. `` The participants in the discussion recognize that all affairs related to trade union movement would be discussed by the round-table,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. `` I propose therefore that we suspend the current strikes. I accepted further talks with central authorities and turn to the strike committes for the actual ending of the negotiation of other postulates and the suspension of the strikes,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s statement said. After giving the <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> statement, <PERSON> Konopka </PERSON> added: `` I hope that it will appear as a historical day.'' <PERSON> Konopka </PERSON> said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> conferred with strikers at the idled <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> shipyard, where the Solidarity leader still works as an electrician, and the strike there could end very soon. Strikes are in effect at nine other worksites across the country. Solidarity spokesman <PERSON> Piotr </PERSON> <PERSON> Niemczyk </PERSON> said later in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> that all strike committees had been informed of <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s statement. However, strike committee members in <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION> said they will not automatically stop the strike as long their demands concerning local issues are not met, <PERSON> Niemczyk </PERSON> said. The committee proposed talks with management but has so far received no reply, he said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> went to the Roman Catholic episcopate in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> where he conferred with advisers and church officials for two hours after his talks with <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>. In Roman Catholic <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the church is a power rivaling the government. Afterward, he said: `` I am an optimist.'' He then stepped into a car that took him and Solidarity adviser <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> from the capital to the <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> shipyard where <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> founded the union in the labor turmoil of 1980. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> called the meeting a `` welcome and significant step forward.'' It expressed hope the communist authorities are prepared to work with <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and other leaders `` widely admired and trusted by the Polish people.'' Meetings between <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and ranking Polish officials last occurred during his internment in 1982. Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s government imposed martial law in December 1981 to suppress Solidarity, the first free union in the Soviet bloc, and outlawed it in 1982 The current round of labor trouble began two weeks ago and at one point idled 20 plants and mines employing 100,000 people. The meeting with <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> took place on the anniversary of the <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> agreements of Aug. 31, 1980, in which the government recognized the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union Solidarity. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s current labor unrest is the worst since that summer. Attending the meeting in a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> villa, a location kept secret until the talks ended, were <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, Bishop <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dabrowski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciosek </PERSON>, an official of the national unity organization PRON. <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency, carried only a brief report. It listed the participants and said they discussed `` the premises for organizing a ` round-table' meeting and the procedure of holding it.'' A statement from the episcopate that was approved by all involved said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> raised the issue of union pluralism and the role of Solidarity. `` The partners -LRB- in the discussion -RRB- stated that all problems connected with union movement will be discussed at the round table,'' it said. `` There are no taboo subjects.'' <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> proposed on Friday that officials hold a round-table meeting with worker representatives to discuss labor grievances, and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling Politburo endorsed it Tuesday. Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said Tuesday such a meeting could be held as soon as the strikes ended. <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Stelmachowski </PERSON>, a lawyer and senior adviser of Solidarity, said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> agreed to the idea of round-table talks, but only if the agenda included a discussion of the trade federation's future. He said Wednesday's meeting represented the beginning of a process to resolve <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s political and economic problems. He did not exclude the possibility of further preparatory talks before a round-table meeting. Trade unions, the right to form associations and the role of other groups in the government's reform program are core issues for discussion, said <PERSON> Stelmachowski </PERSON>, who is president of the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligentsia </ORGANIZATION> and a specialist in constitutional law. `` The procedure and shape of Solidarity-related union organizations must be the subject of patient negotiations, which have to take a certain time,'' he said. In addition to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> met with six other political figures Wednesday. They included <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobraczynski </PERSON>, the head of <ORGANIZATION> PRON </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Henryk </PERSON> <PERSON> Sienkiewicz </PERSON>, the Solidarity leader in <LOCATION> Silesia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> identified <PERSON> Sienkiewicz </PERSON> only as an engineer.

 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s Lotto jackpot increased Wednesday to a world's record $ 52 million as ticket sales continued booming. Sales for this week's prize were up 36 percent over Wednesday afternoon sales last week, so officials increased the prize from $ 50 million to $ 52 million, said Lottery Secretary <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>. `` Our sales are going into orbit,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gave away $ 51.4 million in June, 21 months after starting its computerized numbers game. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s Lotto began four months ago. `` We have experienced unprecedented growth for a lottery state this young,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said. The $ 52 million jackpot is a world record, according to <ORGANIZATION> Terri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleur </ORGANIZATION>, a senior editor with Gaming and <ORGANIZATION> Wagering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION>, a monthly trade publication based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The jackpot includes three weekly grand prizes, because no one has correctly guessed the six winning numbers drawn each Saturday night since Aug. 6. Last week's jackpot had grown to $ 32 million.

This week's sales of 7.8 million tickets by Wednesday afternoon were up 36 percent over last week's sales, Mrs. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said.

 A Jewish settler whose car was hit by a firebomb accidentally shot and wounded two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers because `` he thought they were terrorists coming to kill him,'' a settler spokesman said. In other violence, two Palestinians were killed in clashes with troops, doctors and news reports said. A third Palestinian died of wounds suffered Tuesday. The three fatalities, of Arabs aged 16 to 22, brought to 258 the number of Palestinians killed since the uprising began Dec. 8. Four Israelis have died during the same period. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> meanwhile called for changing <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> policy to permit civilians and soldiers to open fire on Arab stone-throwers without shooting warning rounds first, an aide said. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said he believes rocks should be `` reclassified as lethal weapons, against which one should defend oneself in the same way as against firebombs and gunfire,'' said aide <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON>. `` A stone must be considered a weapon that can end your life,'' <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> as saying. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, leader of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, has faced criticism from many of the 68,000 Jewish settlers who live in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> along with 1.5 million Palestinians. Settlers have been angered by police confiscation of weapons after civilian shooting incidents in the occupied territories. Meanwhile, an army spokesman said an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> civilian chasing a firebomb thrower near the Jewish <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> settlement of <LOCATION> Efrat </LOCATION> opened fire and accidentally wounded two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. The soldiers also were pursuing the suspect when they were shot, the spokesman said without elaborating. The spokesman said one soldier suffered moderate wounds, and the other was slightly hurt. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the civilian, a resident of the nearby <LOCATION> Tekoa </LOCATION> settlement, was detained for questioning. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedine </PERSON>, a spokesman for Jewish settlements in the area, said a firebomb hit the settler's car and exploded, causing minor damage. The settler got out of his car and opened fire when `` he saw two images holding guns running toward him,'' said <PERSON> Bedine </PERSON>. `` He thought they were terrorists coming to kill him.'' The two were soldiers who had rushed to the scene after being alerted by the sound of the explosion, <PERSON> Bedine </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are very sorry about the harm done to the soldiers,'' <PERSON> Bedine </PERSON> said, adding that the settlements in the area south of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> `` have an excellent relationship with the army.'' In the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>'s Shati refugee camp, troops opened fire to disperse Arab stone-throwers, fatally shooting 17-year-old <PERSON> Hamis </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Minawi </PERSON> in the heart, doctors at <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> said. Five Shati residents were wounded, including a 40-year-old woman shot in the head, the doctors said. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> media reports, citing Arab sources, said troops also shot and killed a 22-year-old <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> man in a clash with Palestinians who hurled rocks, bottles and bricks at soldiers making arrests in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <PERSON> Deir </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghassani </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said villagers buried the victim, <PERSON> Luay </PERSON> <PERSON> Barghouti </PERSON>, immediately after the clash, draping his body in an outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flag. The army said it was checking both reported fatalities. Also Wednesday, 16-year-old <PERSON> Ayman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagar </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION> refugee camp died, one day after being hit in the head and body by rubber bullets, his relatives said. They claimed he also was beaten. The army confirmed the death but said it was investigating the circumstances. Israeli troops frequently use cork-shaped rubber bullets that contain metal pellets to disperse stone-throwers. They bruise but usually are not lethal, although they have caused eye loss and at least one death earlier this year. Last month, the army introduced pointed plastic bullets that penetrate the skin, but are generally only lethal when fired from 20 yards or closer. Palestinians, meanwhile, went on strike for the second straight day in keeping with orders from underground leaders. It was the sixth day of strikes in the last 11 days.

<HEAD>Dirty Air Prompts Emergency Measures; At Least 75 People

<TEXT>
 The government on Wednesday banned half the city's taxis and private autos from the <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> area and ordered factories to slow down to reduce a smog cloud that sent at least 75 people to the hospital. The government Program for Pollution Control said the emergency measures are to remain in effect Thursday. `` There is no wind and we have a high nitrogen dioxide content in the atmosphere,'' said anti-pollution agency spokesman <PERSON> Dimitris </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadjidakis </PERSON>. The agency said levels of nitrogen dioxide, a poisonous reddish-brown gas formed from auto exhaust, reached 561 micrograms per cubic meter Wednesday in parts of central <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, more than twice the danger level of 200 micrograms. A reading of 500 or more calls for emergency measures. The state-run <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Help </ORGANIZATION> said 55 people suffering from pollution-caused heart and respiratory problems were treated at hospital outpatient clincs in the <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> area on Wednesday. Twenty others were hospitalized after fainting on the capital's streets. A private pollution monitoring organization, the <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ecological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, gave a higher figure of 309 for the number of people requiring hospital treatment. Half the city's 730,000 private cars and 15,000 taxis were banned from a 115-square mile area around the city center while <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>' 120 biggest factories were told to reduce output by 30 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. Only vehicles with licence plates ending in odd numbers were allowed in the area. Both August 31 and Sept. 1 are odd-numbered days. A brown smog layer forms over <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> when warm, still air creates a temperature inversion layer in the lower atmosphere, trapping pollutants close to the ground.

 A story about a school for beggars, reported by The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, was the invention of a prankster who specializes in duping the media. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Abel </PERSON>, sometimes called `` the Happy Hoaxer,'' says he posed as <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockford </PERSON>, operator of a school for panhandlers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and got friends who are professional actors to portray beggars. `` I do it to shake up the natives,'' <PERSON> Abel </PERSON>, 62, said Tuesday when he confirmed the hoax from his home in <LOCATION> Westport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` Between the latest ax murders and hostages being taken, it provides levity in the news and a social commentary on the poor.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> published its story on Sunday about <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> teaching beggars to trick people out of their money. But the hoax was n't new Last year, <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> duped a reporter for <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION>, a daily published in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, into writing a magazine story about it, complete with pictures. The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> said it learned about <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> in an Aug. 29 cover story about beggars in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> magazine, found the <ORGANIZATION> Omar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> listed in the telephone book, and set up an interview. <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> showed up with an impressive array of news clippings about his top `` graduates.'' <PERSON> Abel </PERSON>'s scams go back to the 1950s with a widely reported bogus campaign to clothe horses. `` A nude horse is a rude horse,'' he said. He once engineered a mass swoon-in on <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON>'s show, a hoax he later said was sponsored by FAINT _ the <ORGANIZATION> Fight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Idiotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Neurotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION>.

The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said new rules, including elimination of certain stunts, would be in effect for an air show Sunday at <LOCATION> Dinard </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. It did not elaborate on the rules. The ministry also pledged to look carefully at safety precautions for celebrating the 35th anniversary of the <LOCATION> Patrouille </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the nation's premier air acrobatics squad, on Oct. 9 in <LOCATION> Salon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Provence </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> proposed a $ 165 million plan Wednesday to buy back <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, and said he is confident he will regain control of the ministry he lost last year in a sex-and-money scandal. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and his attorney, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Toms </PERSON>, met with <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> bankruptcy trustee M.C. `` Red'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> to present a rough draft of the plan. `` We've discussed the terms; we've agreed on everything,'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said. `` The lawyers are now documenting it and as soon as the papers are ready tomorrow afternoon, and everybody's agreed, we probably will both sign it and then we'll have us a deal.'' Canadian real estate magnate <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Samoth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, earlier offered $ 113 million to buy the ministry's assets <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said Wednesday he was unwilling to increase his offer but was skeptical of <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s proposal. `` Although <PERSON> Samoth </PERSON> enjoys first right of refusal, it does not intend at this point to enter into a bidding war,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said from his office in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said if <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s bid fails to materialize, he may renew his proposal. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> `` has been all talk so far'' and unwilling to reveal his financial backers, he said. `` It makes one wonder where he's getting the cash from.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said he had the financial backing for a purchase that would total at least $ 165 million, including $ 70 million in cash put up at closing. Part of the terms of securing a loan to back his offer was that he not reveal the identity of the lender, he said. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> filed for reorganization in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> in June 1987. Donations had plummeted after <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> left the ministry in March amid allegations of misuse of money and revelations of a sexual encounter several years earlier with church secretary <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>. When he announced the outcome of the meeting with <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was greeted at the offices of the <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ministries </PERSON>, his new organization, by applause and cheers of `` Praise God!'' and `` Thank you, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>!'' `` As it stands now, we will be able to have <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>. It's been a long wait,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> told volunteers, friends and family members, many of whom wept with joy `` We're through the basic negotiations. We just had a few changes to make in our plan,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said. `` We'll be working tonight, burning the midnight oil, and finish the details for tomorrow.'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> had said that he wanted all bids for the ministry's assets in before Thursday <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> will then recommend a buyer to Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, who has the final decision, by Sept. 10. `` When you boil it all down, it's a matter of who would provide the most dollars for the creditors,'' the trustee said. `` My responsibility in this case was to preserve the assets and sell them at the highest possible dollar value so that the creditors could be repaid, if possible, in full.'' In addition to the $ 70 million cash, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said, about $ 80 million would be held to restore the benefits of the `` lifetime partners'' _ large contributors to <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> who had been promised long-term perquisites in exchange for their support; and up to $ 15 million would be used to settle claims against <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. The ministry's assets include the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> theme park near here. With extra funds for improvements and repairs at the park, the final purchase plan could total $ 200 million, <PERSON> Toms </PERSON> said.

 The death toll from flooding climbed to nearly 700 and thousands of people fled their homes Wednesday as the <LOCATION> Buriganga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> flooded low-lying neighborhoods and left one-fourth of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> under water. President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> issued an international appeal for food, helicopters and boats after touring flooded areas in the countryside, where people were throwing their dead into swirling waters because there was no dry land for burial. Local newspapers in Thursday and Wednesday editions reported 140 more flood-related deaths across the country Wednesday, raising the toll in recent floods to 676. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> said Wednesday the official death toll was 250, but the government's count is generally considered low. The independent newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Sangbad </ORGANIZATION> said most of the victims it reported died when boats sank or houses collapsed. But it said some were killed when they were bitten by snakes in the water. `` We need food grains, helicopters and river craft from our friends for tackling the flood,'' <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> told reporters. `` Everywhere I have gone people have asked for drinking water.'' In <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, the capital, residents stocked food, anticipating that floods would force markets to close. Several thousand residents from a low-lying area on the southeastern outskirts of the city were evacuated Wednesday as waters from flooded <LOCATION> Buriganga </LOCATION> breached a protection dam and a 10-mile road. At <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in the oldest part of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, about 3,000 people camped out with the few possessions they rescued from their flooded homes. `` We have now become one family. We are not only sharing our common sorrows. We are also sharing whatever little we have,'' said <PERSON> Mohammadullah </PERSON>, a vegetable seller. Tears rolled down his face as he told how his 5-year-old daughter <PERSON> Rahima </PERSON> <PERSON> Khatoon </PERSON> drowned in her sleep Tuesday when she fell off her bed into the rising water at <LOCATION> Keraniganj </LOCATION> on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>. Hundreds of people made their way to a high road near the <LOCATION> Buriganga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hye </PERSON>, a 35-year-old government clerk, put his two small children on his shoulders as he waded toward a shelter for refugees. His wife, <PERSON> Naila </PERSON> <PERSON> Begum </PERSON>, propelled a pushcart loaded with the family's valuables and their white cat, Beauty. `` We can not let her die,'' <PERSON> Naila </PERSON> said as she petted the cat. `` She will go with us wherever we go.'' The Relief Ministry estimated that nearly one-third of the nation's population of 105 million was affected by the floods. Some areas had only a few inches of water, while in remote northern regions people scrambled up trees with their children and meager foodstuffs and waited for the water to go down. Municipal officials in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, a city of 4 million, estimated one-quarter of the city was affected by floods. Speaking on condition of anonymity, they said up to three-fourths of the sprawling capital could be covered with water before the end of the week. Other officials, also speaking privately, estimated that 100,000 displaced people were seeking shelter in the capital's makeshift relief camps, open parks, streets and with relatives. Floodwaters ranged from waist-deep at spots in <LOCATION> Mirpur </LOCATION> on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> to 2 inches outside an office building whose upper floors house the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in the Motijheel commercial district. Thousands of laborers and volunteers worked around the clock to plug minor breaches in the embankment designed to protect <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Buriganga </LOCATION> during floodtime. So far, few deaths have been reported in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>. Most of the fatalities have occurred at least 40 miles from the capital. Rail service has been suspended in many areas because the tracks are flooded. Train and boats are the main form of transport in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, where the scores of mighty rivers overflow every summer and wash out roads. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> said flood damage this year would be `` many times higher'' than last year's loss of $ 1 billion. In 1987, floods killed more than than 1,200 people in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, where the per capita income is $ 150 a year and 90 percent of the population lives below the poverty level, which is defined as being able to afford a diet of 2,000 calories a day.

<HEAD>Pinochet Makes Rare Appeal For Opposition Support</HEAD>

 President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> called for support from opposition leaders on Wednesday after violent protests followed his nomination as the only candidate in an October presidential referendum. Authorities said hundreds were arrested during widespread rioting Tuesday and three people were killed, including two teen-age boys, as residents threw open their windows and banged pots and pans in defiance. Rioting in the streets broke out after the military junta nominated <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, who took part in the selection process, to be the sole nominee in an October presidential referendum. In a nationally broadcast address Wednesday night, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> made a rare appeal for opposition backing. In previous addresses, he has dismissed opponents as `` traitors,'' `` rats,'' `` highwaymen'' and `` cowards.'' `` Our democracy needs the collaboration of all Chileans,'' he said. `` I call today on my compatriots, supporters and opponents, to assume this noble task. <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> needs you.'' The remarks followed huge demonstratons by thousands of people in the capital and elsewhere. In <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> alone, 846 protesters were arrested during the day-long street demonstrations and clashes, a report from the national police said. It gave no precise figure for arrests outside the capital, although scores were reported arrested in protests in most other cities. Many of those arrested were being released Wednesday after an identity check, some without being charged and others cited to appear before city judges. The national police said the dead included two boys, age 14 and 15, and an adult. It said 21 people were injured in the rioting. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, who commands the army, has led the military government that has governed <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> since September 1973, when the elected government of Marxist President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> was overthrown in a bloody coup by the armed forces. <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> died in the coup. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> was picked in a meeting with the chiefs of the navy, air force and national police to be the sole candidate in an Oct. 5 presidential referendum. If a majority vote in his favor, he will assume a new eight-year term on March 11. If voters reject him, he remains in power until 1990 when an open presidential election is to be held in conjuction with elections for a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The nomination came despite appeals by the local Roman Catholic church and several moderate political organizations for a candidate who would have the backing of both the government and opposition. It also ended speculation that the other commanders, who had publicly expressed support for a civilian nominee, would insist that <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> give up his army commandership in return for the candidacy. The formal nomination declaration refers repeatedly to <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> as army leader and the army commander pointedly made his acceptance speech in military uniform. He can legally remain army leader if he wins the referendum and remains president. Opposition leaders, meanwhile, said that <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s nomination will backfire. ` This confrontational decision directly compromises the armed forces, who will suffer from his defeat in the plebescite,'' <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, leader of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday of <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s selection. The opposition cites several opinion polls that give a 2-1 advantage to <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> opponents in the ballot. Government-contracted polls give him a slight edge in the vote. Speaking to foreign reporters, <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s army commandership `` acts as a kind of shield, and exerts moral pressure on his institution.'' `` Pinochet is too attached to power, and I do n't believe he is willing to give up any of his priveleges,'' he said. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> described `` as generally peaceful'' Tuesday's anti-government protests, in which thousands of people participated But he said he expected that the incidents of violence would be politically exploited by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s administration Interior Minister <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> issued a declaration Wednesday that blamed the violence on the political opposition. `` Once again, extremist groups have sewed death and fear. Those responsible for these acts are clearly identified with the -LRB- supports of a -RRB- vote of ` no.' Christian Democrat vice-president <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaldivar </PERSON> said, however, `` The only violence occurred where there was police repression.'' Riot police squads had broken the demonstrations with tear gas and water cannon. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> described one of Tuesday's falities, that of a 15-year-old boy, as `` one more youth added to the victims of the dictatorship.'' The boy was participating in a pot-banging protest when he was shot twice in the chest by gunmen in a passing car. A 1980 Constitution crafted by the <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> government calls for a phased return to democracy, including a resumption of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1990. However, about a third of the <ORGANIZATION> senate </ORGANIZATION> would government appointees and high-ranking military officials. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also A declaration signed by leaders of a 16-party opposition coalition Wednesday reaffirmed their plans to campaign for a vote of `` no'' in the referendum and, if they win, to negotiate with the armed forces for constitutional changes.

 <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> ranchers nervously hosed down their roofs and moved out belongings Wednesday as forest fires roared to within a few miles of their homes. To the south, in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, wildfires driven by strong wind threatened to close more roads. In eastern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, shifting winds pushed flames through control lines and toward ranches and grain fields. Firefighters also battled blazes blackening forests and fields in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. But there was a glimmer of hope amid the continuing struggles to contain the wildfires: <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials said they have filled hundreds of temporary firefighting positions and had to turn away volunteers. Only <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> now needs more help, they said. `` We really appreciate the public concern and willingness to help in this firefighting effort,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, Rocky Mountain regional director of fire management. `` Response was positive and rapid.'' In <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, 300 firefighters outside the Scapegoat Wilderness area tried to keep flames that spread out from the reserve from burning more private property. `` It's not something you can turn your back on because it's right there,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Krause </PERSON>, whose ranch is only a couple of miles from the fire Gov. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwinden </PERSON> on Wednesday urged Montanans to stay out of the forests during the Labor Day weekend. The state Fish and Game Commission voted to delay for two weeks the opening of the 1988 hunting season. `` We simply do n't need any more fires at this point,'' <PERSON> Schwinden </PERSON> told reporters at a hastily called news conference. `` It's not just simply a matter of the cost of putting out the fires; it is that we are pushing our manpower and equipment resources to the limit.'' He said 5,000 firefighters are battling blazes on 208,000 acres in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. An additional 173,000 acres were burned in earlier fires. The <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> also put forest lands off limits Wednesday, announcing that 3.8 million acres in the eastern part of the state will be closed to the public for the Labor Day weekend and until further notice due to the extreme fire danger and limited resources to fight new fires. In <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, 4,000 men and women are fighting fires that have scorched nearly 524,000 acres, about 23 percent of the park's 2.2 million acres, according to the park's chief naturalist <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. Windy conditions that ended several days of calm weather played havoc with efforts to control the 231,000-acre Clover-Mist fire, burning in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> and neighboring <ORGANIZATION> Shoshone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's an emotional roller coaster,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, an employee of a park concessionaire. `` One minute the fire lays down and looks harmless and then the next day, it gets up and comes at us.'' The park's south entrance remained closed Wednesday, and officials closed a road between <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Junction </LOCATION> and Canyon, two park villages. They hope to reopen the south entrance Thursday for the first time in about two weeks, meaning all five gates will be open. Another blaze, the North Fork fire, burned within two miles of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, but fire officials assured nervous residents that the flames would not reach the town. About 1,000 firefighters constructed lines and removed vegetation and other burnable material from the edge of the town, said fire information officer <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Pidanick </PERSON>. `` The conditions are a heck of a lot better than they were yesterday,'' he said. `` We do n't have the wind.'' Driven by high winds, the 92,600-acre fire burst out of control Tuesday afternoon, jumping the <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and the main road from the park's west entrance to Madison Junction. A flareup Wednesday closed <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s west entrance for several hours in the afternoon. In <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, a pair of strike crews and four bulldozers Wednesday protected the <LOCATION> Star </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> area of eastern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> from the raging Trail Creek fire. National Guard jets surveyed fires. `` The majority of the ranches are on alert,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pugmire </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Caribou </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. `` But we did n't have to alert them. They were all standing outside watching it.'' <PERSON> Pugmire </PERSON> said winds shifted with amazing speed. `` The winds were going one direction and we had a blowout on the northeastern flank,'' he said. `` Then the wind shifted 180 degrees and the fire turned back on its self and began running east. ... There's going to be some spots that are going to grow on us before we get a handle on it.'' The Trail Creek fire southwest of <LOCATION> Palisades </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reservoir </LOCATION> was the most threatening of 17 major blazes raging across <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and up into the <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. More than 2,500 firefighters backed up by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> personnel and equipment battled the worst of the blazes that have burned more than 70,000 acres of forest and range lands in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> firefighters got a break Wednesday from Mother Nature. There were only 243 lightning strikes Tuesday night, compared with nearly 9,500 the day before, said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrill </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. By Wednesday morning, firefighters contained most of the more than 100 brush and timber fires started by lightning Monday and early Tuesday, officials said. But two new fires flared in the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, one called the Garnet Fire, over about 100 acres in the <LOCATION> Kings </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION> in the southern <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION>, and another near <LOCATION> Mariposa </LOCATION> just outside <LOCATION> Yosemite </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. The Mariposa blaze, which was sparked by children playing with matches, destroyed at least one home and forced the evacuation of 17 people as it grew to 250 acres, said state Forestry spokeswoman <PERSON> Kary </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, firefighters adopted a fall-back strategy against the Tepee Butte fire, which has burned 35,775 acres of grass and timber on the <ORGANIZATION> Wallowa-Whitman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> and the Hell's <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION>. The blaze will grow to 59,000 acres before it reaches fire lines being built by 679 firefighters, spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> DeHart </PERSON> said. `` We can not safely put crews up close to this fire'' because of the extremely rugged terrain and flash fuels, he said. <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> firefighters controlled a 525-acre fire near northern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s Pineview Reservoir and a 100-acre brush fire in <LOCATION> Butterfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION>, and expect to control a 60-acre blaze in eastern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> by Thursday night. In eastern <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, a brief respite from hot and dry weather allowed firefighters to gain ground on major fires burning in more than 23,000 acres of trees and brush. But a warming trend is expected over the next few days. `` That's not good,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> DeHart </PERSON>, a spokesman for the multiagency fire coordinating center in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, Ore

 Drawn by adventure and hopes of big profits, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s 238 newly licensed alligator hunters are getting ready to begin the state's first legal gator hunt in 26 years. More than 5,000 novice and skilled hunters alike scrambled to apply for the permits after game officials announced the hunt, designed to trim an alligator population that was once threatened by poachers but is now an estimated at 1 million. Wide-eyed amateurs will be stalking freshwater swamps, lakes and streams with hopes of cashing in on their catch, which can bring as much as $ 1,000 for a 10-foot gator's skin and meat. But some experts are wondering if the permit holders really know what they're in for. `` You got to laugh when you hear these people say they're going to make money off this hunt,'' said 37-year-old <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON>, who operates one of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s few alligator processing plants.

 A gene inherited by a third of all white Americans may be responsible for most cancer of the colon and rectum, and a search is on to pinpoint this inborn cancer trigger, researchers say.

<HEAD>``Value'' System For Building Savings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Looking for a disciplined, systematic way to build up a nest egg for college tuition or retirement? Consider a technique that Capt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edleson </PERSON>, an assistant economics professor at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, calls `` value averaging.'' <PERSON> Edleson </PERSON>'s idea is a new twist on the old, popular strategy known as dollar cost averaging, which calls for investing identical amounts at regular intervals in a vehicle such as a mutual fund. But unlike dollar-cost averaging, value averaging provides a structure that tells you when to sell as well as when to buy. The basic idea of value averaging, described by <PERSON> Edleson </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Individual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION>' <ORGANIZATION> AAII </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, is to increase the total value of your investment by a set amount each month. Suppose you want to build up a mutual fund account to $ 24,000 over the next 10 years to help pay college costs for a child now in second grade. You can pursue that goal by seeing that the account's value increases by $ 200 each month through that 10-year period. The first month, you simply make an initial investment of $ 200. Starting in the second month, you invest whatever it takes to increase the overall value of your holdings by $ 200. If the net asset value of the fund's shares declines, you will need to put up more than $ 200 in the second month. If it rises, however, you will invest less. Assuming that sooner or later the fund enters a period of strong performance, you are likely to encounter months in which price appreciation alone increases the value of your holdings by more than $ 200. In those instances, you do n't invest any money at all. Rather, you SELL, or redeem, enough shares to bring the monthly increase back down to $ 200, perhaps by switching the surplus into a money-market fund. A reserve in the money fund will help you keep the system going in periods when the fund declines, making new monthly investments of substantially more than $ 200 necessary. Spotted a flaw or two in this whole deal? Well yes, <PERSON> Edleson </PERSON> concedes, there are some. For one thing, the monthly mathematical exercise required makes it more complicated and time-consuming than a simple dollar-cost averaging program. Investing and redeeming odd amounts regularly can incur forbidding transaction costs _ one reason why, as <PERSON> Edleson </PERSON> says, value averaging works best with a mutual fund that has no sales or redemption fees and generous telephone switching privileges. Then there's the problem of taxes on capital gains every time you sell. You can dodge this if you are operating inside an individual retirement arrangement that is not subject to current taxation. Otherwise, <PERSON> Edleson </PERSON> says, there is an alternative: `` Simply do nothing when the value averaging rules indicate that you should sell shares.'' Under this approach, you let the surplus stand in the account for as long as it takes to have the $ 200 monthly increases catch up with it. If there is still a surplus when the 10 years are up, no complaints _ you have exceeded your goal. `` This same variation lends itself well to use with dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plans, a popular tool for individual investors,'' <PERSON> Edelson </PERSON> notes. In such plans, selling in small amounts is often impractical or not allowed. An obvious objection to this whole arrangement presents itself readily: You are limiting what your money can achieve. The better your fund performs, the more potential gains you will miss out on. `` You wo n't get rich quick,'' <PERSON> Edleson </PERSON> acknowledges. But the point of the system is to encourage both buying at low prices and selling _ or at least not buying _ at high prices.

 Even for television, the scene sounds improbable: <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> mobsters with Sicilian accents making death threats in Chinese subtitles. But believe it _ the underworld sells overseas. From <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, foreign viewers are so hungry for American shows that even borderline series like the failed mob drama `` Our Family Honor'' or the grounded helicopter yarn `` Airwolf'' can be resurrected. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers, meanwhile, are enjoying the windfall. They expect to collect $ 600 million in foreign television revenues this year, up 100 percent from three years ago. `` International sales used to be considered gravy,'' said <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. `` Now, international revenue is considered an integral part of a show's budget. The foreign market, growing steadily for 10 years, has yet to influence programming decisions directly _ <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> is n't yet taking afternoon tea and snacking on scones on `` Miami Vice,'' for instance. `` I think those days are still a long way away,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> division. `` The producers must first pay attention to American tastes.'' Still, said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, `` There are general discussions now of how a show will play in the foreign market.'' In an era of tighter finances in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, it is increasingly important that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television shows `` travel'' _ that foreign audiences be able to understand the stories. `` <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> and ` <ORGANIZATION> Laverne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>' travel well, because the comedy is visual,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>. `` But ` Family Ties' is not visual comedy. It's spoken comedy. ` Cheers' is the same _ it's a play on words. It's hard to retain the humor -LRB- in translation -RRB-.'' The most consistently popular shows overseas are action-adventure programs _ a car chase or a shootout is just as exciting in Arabic as it is in English. And who watches `` Hunter'' for its dialogue, anyway? `` Even if a show like ` MacGyver' is badly translated, the action speaks for itself,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>. Action-adventure shows also represent a programming bargain for foreign buyers. `` The Equalizer,'' which could cost the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> $ 1 million an episode to produce, for example, costs a fraction of that through foreign syndication. For the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers, those fractions add up, and quickly. Many television shows are sold to the networks at a loss, with producers hoping to recoup the shortfall through rerun sales. `` If you ca n't make up your -LRB- production -RRB- deficits with foreign sales, you should n't make the show,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, a top executive at <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telepictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> is convinced that one of the brightest areas for television growth rests overseas. The five-month writers' strike against producers hinged on rerun payments for foreign reruns, with the writers finally accepting a compromise payment formula. `` Whatever the producers are most hesitant to negotiate is always where the next boom lies,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Sellers </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> negotiating committee. According to the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION>, while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has one television set for every person, the rest of the world averages one set for every 10 people. Writers and producers alike are looking to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television syndication is relatively new and, so far, predictably profitable. In the 1970s, when `` El Show de <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON>'' was a favorite in Paraguayan bars, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> audiences represented the majority of the foreign television audience. Then the Latin economy slumped. `` The easiest thing to do in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> now is to sell,'' <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said. `` The hardest thing to do is collect.'' European markets began to open up in the 1980s, as more and more countries allowed the operation of private networks. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> was followed by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, and private networks are emerging in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. Roughly 60 percent of international television revenues now come from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. And the future looks healthy. In 1975, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> sold about $ 1 million in programming to eight European stations. In the 1987 fiscal year, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> sold programs to 78 European outlets with revenues of more than $ 47 million. The biggest potential audience, though, may be one of the hardest to reach: The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But who knows? Maybe the Soviets are ready for `` The Gong Show.'' Then again, maybe world peace is more important.

 The new director of the <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pageant </ORGANIZATION> says there will be so many changes in Saturday's production that he fears raised eyebrows among fans of the 67-year-old tradition. But before anyone gasps, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> is quick to point out that the swimsuit competition is still in place _ even though he believes there may be other means of proving a young woman's fitness The winner still will take her stroll down the runway, a much longer runway this time, to the tune of `` There She Is.'' And the show still will feature an elaborate stage production, but new musical director <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Pippin </PERSON> has created a livelier tempo that's not quite rock' n' roll but just as spirited. <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> is more concerned about the long-time supporters of the pageant who bought seats even in the lean years when it was weathering attacks from feminists. Some of those supporters have unhappily learned they've been bumped from their box seats to make room for bigwigs representing the eight corporate sponsors and even some high-rollers from <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> casinos. <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> also knocked out a production number and replaced it with video segments showing the finalists being interviewed by the judges. He eliminated a prepared speech each inalist gave in the evening gown competition in favor of asking the women unrehearsed questions. `` It wo n't be a cutesy question,'' he said. `` It will be sufficiently provocative to elicit an intelligent response which might give us further insight into her ability to articulate under pressure.'' The changes were necessary to keep the pageant up to date and attract the younger, female audience that had stopped watching the show in recent years, <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said. `` Some people believe the pageant has gotten stale,'' said <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, who took over when <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Marks </PERSON> retired last year after 37 years. `` All we're trying to do is give it the vigor it once had ... and reconfirm that it's a positive program that deserves people's respect. For the 51 contestants, from the states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, a week of pageantry and preliminary competitions lead to Saturday night's nationally televised finale. Reaching <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> has been a rocky trip for some contestants. In th <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, the entire pageant was restaged after national pageant officials found problems with the judging. The original winner, <PERSON> Edwina </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, became first runner-up and has said, `` I feel like I became a victim.'' In <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, the winner, <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON>, has denied accusations she was promised the crown when she was a runner-up the year before. Earlier this year, a former <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> pageant board member wrote to national officials saying she had firsthand knowledge that blacks were not being given a fair shot at the crown. Miss <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> not only had to watch in dismay as a defeated contestant loudly denounced the pageant but also had to respond to rumors she suffers from anorexia nervosa, the eating disorder. In the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> state pageant, some contestants grumbled that one of the judges was acquainted with the winner. About 80,000 young women enter local contests that lead to the Miss America Pageant. More than $ 5 million in cash and tuition scholarships is available this year.

 Faced with the prospect of losing the grain farm that has been in their family for most of this century, seven members of the <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurth </PERSON> family turned to a new cash crop _ marijuana. That decision, discovered in a drug bust last fall, has turned many in this farm town of 1,700 against the Kurths. Some see no end to the controversy, particularly after most of the family received reduced sentences. `` I do n't believe they will ever be able to live in the community again,'' said <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, editor of The River Press newspaper. `` It's never going to be forgotten.'' Yet some of the Kurths say all they want to do is remain on the 4,500-acre farm and cattle feedlot, which still faces foreclosure. `` I'm not going to let a community shove me out,'' said <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Halley </PERSON>, daughter of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurth </PERSON>, the family patriarch. It's not just the family's action that has upset <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Benton </LOCATION>. About 960 valid signatures, far more than the 549 needed, have been gathered on a petition to recall <LOCATION> Chouteau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> over the way the case was handled. `` This type of prosecution will only encourage more drug traffic,'' says the petition, which expresses concern over plea bargaining and notes the Kurths were not required to post bond. `` This ` prominent' family has never paid a cent of bail, they were n't brought in,'' complained <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Appleby </PERSON>, who runs a local motel. Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gertson </PERSON>, heading the recall effort, said people wanted <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> to turn the case over to federal prosecutors `` because we felt like he was inexperienced and we felt like he was so liberal that nothing would happen.'' The prosecutor, who is suing to invalidate the recall petitions, defended the plea bargains that resulted in convictions of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurth </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON>, both 57, and five others. `` Guilty is guilty,'' <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> said. He noted that District Judge <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ettien </PERSON> released the family members on their own recognizance and reduced sentences that <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> recommended. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurth </PERSON> received four concurrent 20-year sentences, with all but five years suspended, while his wife received a five-year sentence with all but one year suspended. Both could be out in less than a year, with good behavior. Sentences for the others were suspended altogether or deferred. <PERSON> Ettien </PERSON> struck a nerve with his courtroom comment that the social ill from marijuana use `` does not approach that of alcohol.'' The judge, who declined to elaborate, wrote in his sentencing order that, except for one criminal offense, the Kurths had been `` an exemplary group.'' Some people in town agree. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Axtman </PERSON>, who sells farm equipment and had two <PERSON> Kurth </PERSON> children in his Boy Scout troop, said, `` I'm not a supporter of what they did. I do n't think anyone is. But they were good people.'' Up to a point, they were typical people, too. Most farmers in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> have suffered years of drought and low prices for grain. But in 1985, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurth </PERSON> decided that to pay their debts they would grow marijuana. They have said the decision stemmed from an offhand remark made by an officer of <ORGANIZATION> Norwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>. `` Perhaps in jest, perhaps not,'' the bank officer suggested they could save their ranch only by `` growing an illegal cash crop of some sort, perhaps marijuana,'' defense lawyer <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Randono </PERSON> said at the couple's sentencing. He contended the bank was `` very aware'' of what the Kurths were doing. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, president of the bank, termed the comments `` preposterous and total fabrications.'' After beginning the operation, the couple decided to recruit their adult children. All three agreed, along with two of their spouses; son <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurth </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, was not involved, authorities said. `` Kind of the way I took it was either you hop on the bandwagon and help out or I guess you can just go down the road and find another job,'' said son-in-law <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> <PERSON> Halley </PERSON>, `` because it was either do this and save the ranch or there was n't going to be any ranch.'' In nearly two years, authorities say the family sold $ 400,000 worth of marijuana. In addition to the sentences, the state is seeking $ 750,000 in taxes and interest, based on the estimated value of the 2,155 marijuana plants seized in last October's raid. Family members had a lot to learn about growing marijuana, they said in a recent interview. First, they went to libraries and bookstores. They also received advice from customers, lost some crops and learned from mistakes. `` Just like anything else in agriculture, you try it and if it does n't work, you change it and try it again,'' <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> <PERSON> Halley </PERSON> said. Hired men and customers came and went at the farm, 14 miles south of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Benton </LOCATION>, without knowing marijuana was being grown and dried in four separate buildings with automatic watering and lighting systems. Windows and doors in those buildings were locked and covered. Even sheriff's deputies, serving papers involving the Kurths' debts, had no reason to suspect anything, said Undersheriff <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> The loan agreement showed <ORGANIZATION> Norwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> had agreed to forgive the Kurths' $ 1.3 million loan if they paid $ 275,000. They paid $ 125,000 and hoped to make the final payments by April 1988, then restructure their debts with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, save the farm and stop growing marijuana. `` Our objective was to not continue this thing over two years, and when we got done in two years, to still have a ranch,'' said son <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurth </PERSON>. Just 5 -LCB- months before the last loan payment was due, federal and county law officers arrived at the <PERSON> Kurth </PERSON> property, after receiving a tip. The Kurths say they were actually relieved to see law officers pull up on Oct. 18. Two days earlier, men posing as <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agents had attempted a robbery. The following day, they had received a $ 25,000 extortion demand. But they have since had to face their own young children, deal with publicity and withstand the continued scrutiny of their neighbors and the townspeople. The family's clothing, cars, travel and entertainment are often discussed, and many people maintain the Kurths could have altered a lifestyle described as `` high-flying'' if they had truly wanted to get out of debt. `` They lived so much higher than people who were in debt,'' said <PERSON> Gertson </PERSON>. `` They were flashy in their dress, flashy in their way of living.'' And editor <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurth </PERSON>, `` His lifestyle is not poor farmer, and never has been.'' <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurth </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Rhonda </PERSON>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Halleys </ORGANIZATION> say such talk is a price they pay for living in a small town. Despite it all, the two families want to remain. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> summed up the message he'd like to convey to the community, saying: `` Hey, it's over with. We're paying our debt to society. Leave us alone.''

 In the five years since a federal panel branded <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s schools `` mediocre,'' states have responded by raising teacher salaries and heaping layers of tests, rules and regulations on schools. But AP reporters in all 50 states now find reformers urging a new route to school improvement: more say from the teachers, and less from the state, on what happens in the classroom.

<TEXT>
 After spending five years and billions of tax dollars raising classroom standards and teacher salaries, some states and school districts are turning to the teachers themselves to lead the next leg of the journey to better schools. But they warn this latest reform effort will take years to reap benefits. Most states, prodded by dozens of reports since a national commission in 1983 branded <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s schools `` mediocre,'' imposed layer upon layer of `` top-down'' reforms. They raised teacher pay but also imposed stricter course guidelines and new competency tests for both teachers and students. A 50-state survey by <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporters now finds a growing willingness among states and school districts to ease their regulatory grip on public schools and give teachers a more direct role in shaping curricula. Reformers say teaching, even with fatter paychecks, has become less attractive because the new rules thwart initiative. And while students may be better test-takers, they add, reforms to date have not provided the critical thinking skills needed in a competitive world. `` Most of the reforms so far have been paper and headlines,'' said <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Corelle </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Getting beyond such surface reforms has been difficult in many schools, however, where educators refuse to acknowledge how bad off some students are. `` Very few schools look at the national picture and realize that only 15 percent -LRB- of high school students -RRB- can write a simple letter. And only a small percentage can locate the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> on a map, or work with a simple bus timetable,'' said <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>. `` So why should anyone change their ways and habits unless in their gut they feel the system is n't working?'' <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> and other reform leaders are now telling states that the path to better schools goes through the schoolhouse, not the statehouse _ freeing teachers to try new lessons and ideas, and students to learn at their own pace instead of in lockstep with peers. Some districts are getting the message. A dozen <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> districts are experimenting with `` outcome-based education,'' in which students scoring less than a `` B'' on assignments get extra time and tutoring to redo the work without getting a poor mark. <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> is spending $ 1 million on a similar program. `` There are people who say kids need to fail,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON>, principal of <ORGANIZATION> Alhambra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. `` I think that's garbage. We're here to teach you success.'' <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, made headlines with a teacher contract raising top pay to $ 70,000 from $ 51,000. But more important than the lofty salaries, say both the school board and the teachers union, are `` school-based planning teams'' in which teachers and administrators will plan how to run their schools relatively free of school board interference. A contract with similar provisions _ and teacher salaries as high as $ 64,000 _ takes effect this fall in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, which includes <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, and administrators this summer report getting as many as eight applications for each opening. `` The new thinking is getting teachers more involved in the decision-making in the school,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>'s public schools where `` instructional cabinets'' of teachers and administrators can shape teaching techniques for individual students. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> has given most students the right to attend any school districts they wish. Advanced high school students can even take courses at public colleges at the state's expense. In <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> Lake </PERSON>, one of several <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> school districts being freed to tailor education programs with less bureaucratic interference, teacher lounges are suddenly alive with talk about how to use this new freedom to help the district's low-income children who are n't achieving. `` We are experimenting. This is a search for solutions. We want to remove the shackles of bureaucracy and regulation that inhibit creativity and initiative in our schools,'' said Gov. <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, one of the only states requiring students at all grade levels to pass standardized tests, is now excusing first-graders out of concern for the pressure the tests put on young children. `` It's gratifying. I think some political leaders now realize school reform is more complicated than they thought. They are straightforward enough to say, well, let's take the other road,'' said <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Sizer </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s education department and a guiding force behind the reform wave. Since his widely acclaimed book `` <PERSON> Horace </PERSON>'s Compromise'' was published in 1984, <PERSON> Sizer </PERSON> has pressed school authorities to free teachers from blackboard lectures, dull texts and multiple-choice tests, to function instead as coaches training students to think independently. Five states _ <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> _ have said they will free at least 10 schools this year to try <PERSON> Sizer </PERSON>'s philosophies. But some fear the odds remain stacked against fundamental change. `` In spite of the few examples here and there, I do not see anything like the will and creativity to achieve radical restructuring,'' said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teaching </ORGANIZATION>, which has produced several widely acclaimed reform documents. He and others are especially concerned that reform has created few meaningful programs for the most troubled students, those at risk of dropping out because of poverty, pregnancy or parental neglect. There are some. <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> this year appropriated $ 4.5 million to help at-risk children statewide, and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> will award $ 20 million to local districts to help such children. <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> is spending $ 850,000 on 2,000 disadvantaged preschool children. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> has earmarked $ 23 million to help disadvantaged 3 - and 4-year-olds <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> requires districts to provide education programs for pregnant teens and teen-age parents. <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>, whose union this year endorsed the principle of local school experimentation, as did the rival <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said his biggest worry is that schools might be too cynical to adopt new ways. `` If there's an enemy, it's likely to be us,'' he said. `` A lot of school districts are n't doing anything, and they are praying for the others to fail because they do n't want to look bad themselves.'' After five years of efforts, reform leaders worry that an impatient nation will be disillusioned if the latest tactics fail to pay off. `` You ca n't reform schools rapidly, unless you're faking it,'' said <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON>, dean of <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s school of education. `` If you're at the beginning of a revolution, you have to support and encourage different trials _ not condemn the whole movement if a few things do n't work, but accept the complexity of the task.''

 Here, at a glance, is a look at recent school reforms in all 50 states, and what's ahead.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> ALABAMA </LOCATION> _ State education spending has lagged, and superintendent <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Teague </PERSON> blames Gov. Guy Hunt for insisting he wo n't permit new taxes until the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> makes schools more accountable. State scrapped a career ladder program begun in 1985. Teachers got 15 percent pay raise in 1985, but none since. State spending per pupil was $ 2,612, ahead of only <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Wilcox </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, the state's poorest, schools lack air conditioning, drinkable water and libraries. <LOCATION> ALASKA </LOCATION> _ Reform faces obstacles here, with oil revenues down and just getting to school the biggest educational challenge for many students. Several hundred disadvantaged students in five districts were enrolled in a student retention program stressing vocational education and basic skills. The <ORGANIZATION> Cordova </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> set up a four-year fisheries apprenticeship for at-risk youth in that port city. <LOCATION> ARIZONA </LOCATION> _ The state was one of the few to require standardized testing in each grade. But the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> rolled back its mandatory test requirement for first-graders, saying it put undue pressure on youngsters. Teacher salaries now average $ 27,388, and a pilot career ladder program is in its fourth year in 10 districts. Legislature this year appropriated $ 4.5 million to help at-risk students statewide for first time. <LOCATION> ARKANSAS </LOCATION> _ Graduation requirements were boosted in 1983. Last year, 93 percent of third-graders passed the state's Minimum Performance Test reading section, compared with 84 percent in 1985. State requires extra help for students who fail to get satisfactory scores in grade three or grade six. Students who fail in eighth-grade are held back. State still ranks near botttom in teacher pay, with salaries ranging from $ 14,000 to $ 25,000. <LOCATION> CALIFORNIA </LOCATION> _ Partisan fighting between Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> and state schools chief <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Honig </PERSON> threatens the teacher pay gains and higher classroom standards enacted in 1983. Californians will vote this November on a teacher-initiated measure calling for minimum funding levels for schools. The state spent $ 22.75 billion for public schools, up only 13 percent from 1983-84 levels counting inflation. <LOCATION> COLORADO </LOCATION> _ State is boosting revenues to school districts by 4.16 percent next January to even out disparities between rich and poor districts. The state appropriated $ 850,000 for 2,000 preschool children considered at risk. <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> has a goal of an 87 percent high school graduation rate by 1995, but has hovered in the mid-70 percent range since 1982. <LOCATION> CONNECTICUT </LOCATION> _ State is in final year of a three-year, $ 300 million program aimed at reducing class size and boosting teacher salaries to at least $ 20,000 in every town. Local superintendents report increase in teacher applicants. Voted in May to become the first state to distribute education aid based in part on student test scores, sending more money to districts where pupils perform poorly. <LOCATION> DELAWARE </LOCATION> _ Education spending grew from $ 249 million in 1983 to $ 355 million in fiscal 1989, and average teacher pay soared from 22nd in the nation to 13th. State mandates testing in grades 1-8 and 11, but program being reviewd because testing focuses on too narrow a set of skills. State will deregulate four schools to allow teachers and administrators to reorganize schools. <LOCATION> FLORIDA </LOCATION> _ Legislators boosted education spending by 12.6 percent to $ 8.35 billion this spring and raised average teacher pay 8 percent. <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> teachers signed a landmark pact increasing salaries by 28 percent, topping at $ 64,000, and giving teachers broad powers including a voice in hiring principals. With one of the nation's highest dropout rates, the state earmarked $ 23 million to start a program to help disadvantaged 3 - and 4-year-olds <LOCATION> GEORGIA </LOCATION> _ Kindergartners must pass a test to advance to first grade. Last month the state board approved curriculum revisions and included mandatory sex education in first-grade and AIDS education for sixth-graders. But critics say the state underfunds programs aimed at at-risk children. State is piloting a teacher career ladder program in several districts this fall. <LOCATION> HAWAII </LOCATION> _ Average minimum teacher salaries will rise to $ 23,000 next February, from $ 18,689. State has increased graduation requirements in math and science and reduced average kindergarten class size to 20 children. Teacher unions complain reform here remains dictated by the state, with little input from teachers or others at the school level. <LOCATION> IDAHO </LOCATION> _ State boosted education funding two years ago by 9.6 percent and by 6.7 percent this year, to $ 356 million. Starting September, new teachers must pass a competency exam, and the state will start competency testing of sixth-graders. Legislature last year failed to fund program to help at-risk students. <LOCATION> ILLINOIS </LOCATION> _ Education spending declined $ 75 million in 1987-88 as <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> turned aside tax hikes backed by Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. A new teacher certification exam is being introduced, but critics question its toughness. Graduation requirements have been replaced by `` learning outcomes'' that outline basic skills students must master, such as essay writing or solving algebraic equations. An early childhood program for high-risk children is reaching only 6 percent of the state's 112,000 at-risk preschoolers, but funding may be increased next year. A reform package for the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> district, branded the worst in the nation by outgoing Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, is still up in the air, pending passage of <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s amended version. If it becomes law, the proposal would slash bureaucracy and greatly increase parental and neighborhood involvement with the 594 individual schools. <LOCATION> INDIANA </LOCATION> _ Boosted state funding by $ 631 million in current biennium, with lion's share toward increasing school year to 180 days from 175. State will give $ 10 million in grants to schools where students excel. Starting this year, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> will award $ 20 million to help at-risk children. <LOCATION> IOWA </LOCATION> _ State appropriated $ 92.5 million in 1986 to boost minimum teacher salaries to $ 18,000, give others across-the-board increases and provide extra pay increases to outstanding teachers. State is currently reviewing accreditation standards for elementary and secondary schools. Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> says he will propose new spending for at-risk students next year. <LOCATION> KANSAS </LOCATION> _ State has provided no incentives for local school restructuring. State has required teachers to pass certification test since 1986. Since last year, high school graduates must complete 21 units in core subjects like math, science, social studies and English, up from 18. <LOCATION> KENTUCKY </LOCATION> _ Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> has said he will call a special legislative session in January to push his plan for fewer controls on local educators and an incentive program rewarding schools for improvements by students. <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> would also establish a group of benchmark schools as laboratories for innovation. State-mandated teacher salaries now range from $ 13,040 to $ 27,010, although minimums are often supplemented at the local level.

 <LOCATION> LOUISIANA </LOCATION> _ Teachers in poor parishes make as little as $ 12,200, but the state has boosted education spending by almost $ 300 million, much of that to raise teacher pay. State also ended lifetime teacher certification and provided for performance reviews. State ranks 49th in literacy, and nearly 50 percent of high school graduates entering state universities must take remedial courses. Starting next year, 11th-graders will have to pass a high school exit test to graduate. <LOCATION> MAINE </LOCATION> _ Education spending rose almost 25 percent to $ 430 million this year, one of the largest increases in any state. Mandatory starting teacher salary is $ 15,500 and average for all teachers is $ 23,425 _ well below national average of $ 28,000. Teacher certification standards were tightened, and all teachers must submit `` action plans'' to a panel of peers, outlining course work and professional activities before their licenses are renewed. This year the state plans to pilot `` restructuring programs'' at 10 schools that will be free to experiment. <LOCATION> MARYLAND </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> schools plan to experiment this year and give schools more autonomy. State is in second year of 5-year plan to boost school aid, increase teacher salaries and improve staffing. <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s year-old `` Tomorrow Program'' identifies at-risk children and uses public and private funds to try to keep them in school, using tutoring and private job experience. High school seniors will be required for the first time to to pass tests in four areas to graduate. <LOCATION> MASSACHUSETTS </LOCATION> _ School finances and teacher salaries are still reeling from Proposition 2 -LCB-, a 1980 voter initiative that pared taxes. Over 70 percent of the state's education graduates leave the state, often to neighboring <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> where salaries are better. The state provided some relief on starting teacher pay in 1985. A state project selects 10-12 schools each year and allows them to experiment with school day length, textbook choices and anything else. <LOCATION> MICHIGAN </LOCATION> _ Teachers now must renew their certificates every five years. State included $ 12 million in its most recent budget for preschool programs for at-risk children. <LOCATION> Utica </LOCATION> school district has pioneered early childhood education and has a program teaching Japanese to high school students. <LOCATION> MINNESOTA </LOCATION> _ Education funding is up $ 582 million in current biennium to $ 3.96 billion. Legislature adopted nation's most sweeping open enrollment law in 1988, allowing students broad freedom to choose which schools they attend. Students in 11th and 12th grades can take courses in state colleges with the state paying all or part of tuition. A new state law requires each district to provide programs for pregnant teens or teen-age parents. <LOCATION> MISSISSIPPI </LOCATION> _ State is dropping standardized testing of kindergartners next year because of concern that teachers were being overly influenced by the test and pressuring youngsters. Last year, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> placed 48th in teacher salaries, with only <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> paying their teachers less. In May, however, Gov. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> signed a bill raising the average salary $ 3,800, to $ 24,550 next year. `` I think <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> has one of the biggest pay raises for tecahers in' 88-89, but we ca n't be sure until we see the national averages,'' said <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON>, a state education department spokesman <LOCATION> MISSOURI </LOCATION> _ The 1985 Excellence in Education Act set state teacher salary minimums, $ 17,000 this year, and established career ladders in some districts. Starting this month, teacher candidates must pass a basic skills test and aspiring principals and administrators will face an assessment for the first time. <LOCATION> MONTANA </LOCATION> _ No major spending initiatives in recent years. The average teacher salary is $ 23,700, 38th in the nation. The state required new teachers to pass entrance exams for first time in 1986. A proposed state initiative called `` Project Excellence'' would cut class sizes and add librarians, counselors and other personnel, and give school districts greater flexibility over curriculum. State will begin student testing in grades 3, 8 and 11. <LOCATION> NEBRASKA </LOCATION> _ A bill mandating statewide achievement testing died in the Legislature this year. State enacted tougher skills requirements for teachers and passed measures aimed at luring science experts to teach and raising teacher pay, but the bills were never funded. <LOCATION> NEVADA </LOCATION> _ Students will learn about sex and AIDS and take more English, science, arts and computer courses this year, and new teachers face competency tests for the first time. Public school spending has risen 14 percent since 1986-87 to about $ 600 million, and standardized test scores are generally high. But teachers complain not much has been done about salaries or overcrowded classes, high dropout rates and at-risk children. <LOCATION> NEW </LOCATION> <LOCATION> HAMPSHIRE </LOCATION> _ Faced with teacher shortages, the state has loosened certification rules to allow people from industry and recent college grads to teach. Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> signed a law requiring students who want to drop out at age 16 to meet minimum competency criteria. The bill also sets a 36-hour work limit for all 16 - and 17-year-olds while in school <LOCATION> NEW </LOCATION> <LOCATION> JERSEY </LOCATION> _ Increased aid to school districts by $ 310 million this year to $ 3.4 billion. Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> won approval for a measure allowing state to take over failing school districts and began steps to take over the <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> district. State has been a trendsetter in easing the path from other professions to teaching. This year's high school seniors are the first to be required to pass a basic skills test to graduate. Although the test was criticized as absurdly easy, barely half the ninth-graders in urban districts passed it. NEW <LOCATION> MEXICO </LOCATION> _ Tight finances have forced lawmakers to postpone implementation of a 1986 reform measure lowering pupil-teacher ratios. State funding has increased 23 percent since 1984-5 to $ 814.9 million, mainly because enrollments rose 7 percent. Average teacher pay fell to 29th in the nation, $ 24,219, compared with 23rd in 1980. State now requires parent involvement in textbook selection process. <LOCATION> NEW </LOCATION> <LOCATION> YORK </LOCATION> _ State education spending was up a record $ 700 million in 1987-88, to $ 8 billion. <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> became a beacon of reform this year with a teacher contract setting top salaries of $ 70,000 and encouraging classroom creativity. Legislature adopted a measure aimed at helping poor New Yorkers get a free public college education. State is studying a new teacher licensing system to set standards that would be among the toughest in the nation, including requiring new teachers to have a master's degree. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> started a pre-kindergarten program this summer for youngsters who might have trouble in school. <LOCATION> NORTH </LOCATION> <LOCATION> CAROLINA </LOCATION> _ State plans to hire 11,000 more teachers by 1993-94, and lower class sizes to 23 in elementary grades, and 26 in upper grades. The state aims to provide second-language instruction to all elementary students, and roughly 60 of the state's 140 districts now do so. The state has a 2-year-old career ladder program in 16 school districts, but teacher unions oppose it. State allotted $ 30 million for summer programs for students not meeting promotion requirements; 80,000 attended them this summer.

 For years, <PERSON> Reggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutter </PERSON> and fellow teachers at <ORGANIZATION> Moses </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> had looked for ways to break the traditional public school mold and give students the special attention denied them in a rigid system. This year, <PERSON> Sutter </PERSON> and the others will get a chance to experiment with reform, freed of state requirements under a pilot program called `` Schools for the 21st Century'' created this year by the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>. He is among several hundred teachers in 21 school districts involved in a bold plan aimed at giving the state `` a world class education system by the 21st century,'' in the words of Gov. <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>. Backed by $ 2.1 million in state money to pay teachers for extra time spent planning, the program will allow the teachers to shake up their classrooms rather than their bosses and the school boards who've been dictating what to do. `` Now, with the flexibility of the 21st century program, we can experiment. It gives us a way to create, to do something different,'' said <PERSON> Sutter </PERSON>, who teaches Spanish and social studies in <LOCATION> Moses </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION>, a central <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> city about 230 miles east of <LOCATION> Olympia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sutter </PERSON> says his first order of business is to expand his homework hotline, a program in which high school students can call peers for help with homework. `` We're starting a guest speaker program. We're also starting a telephone counseling service where students can call anonymously and get referred to places where they can get help for drug addiction or whatever,'' <PERSON> Sutter </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sutter </PERSON>'s excitement can also be found at <LOCATION> Moses </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Larson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. There, teachers are reorganizing curricula and classrooms for the 300 pupils, many of whom are from low-income families and lag in achievement. `` Basically, what the teachers are doing is creating opportunities to enrich these kids, to enrich their minds,'' said <PERSON> P.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>, a district official working with the teachers on alternative education plans. For example, the teachers have decided to keep <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> Heights open until 6 p.m. each day, giving latchkey kids and others a way to profit from free time. `` The kids can use the school computers. They can work on their homework in a quiet, supervised setting. There will be storytime, organized recreation, arts and crafts,'' <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think I've ever seen our teachers this excited or this enthusiastic,'' said <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> superintendent <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Edlund </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Backed by a broad new law, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> is trying to seize control of a major urban school district it considers to be educationally bankrupt. State officials say schools in <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s second largest city, are so crippled by political patronage that local leaders can not make desperately needed improvements. Symptomatic, they say, are curricula on Afro-American history that end with the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration. City officials disagree and are trying to block the takeover. <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> is providing the first test of a law enacted in January giving <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> power to take over chronically troubled schools. <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> have laws of varying strength allowing state takeovers of failing school districts, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Laws in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> let the state eliminate deficient districts, and an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> law allows the state to revoke a district's charter. A <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> law allows financial penalties in the form of reduced state aid. If <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> wins, it can abolish the local board of education, fire administrators and appoint a state superintendent to operate the district of 32,000 students for five years. `` When schools fail, it's adults who failed, and adults should pay the price,'' Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> said when he signed the law. <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> officials say their city suffers from the poverty and crime typical of urban districts. They contend that to single out <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for state takeover is unfair when efforts are being made to reverse the decay from years of political intrusion under former administrations. The state launched the takeover in May after almost three years of investigation and monitoring in the district. `` I do n't think they were looking for anything right. They were on a mission to point up what was wrong,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Massa </PERSON>, attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. Takeover hearings before an administrative law judge are expected to last into January. The earliest the state could take control is next May, but appeals by the district could further delay action. State investigators said they found financial irregularities, questionable payroll and personnel practices and incompetent management. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON>, the state's lead investigator, said district employees are routinely rewarded or demoted based on which mayoral candidate they backed in the most recent election. They also cited low test scores and high truancy rates. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> students registered the third lowest passing rate in the state on a mandatory statewide ninth-grade test. Eleven other <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> districts, including <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, are in the third and final stage of state monitoring that precedes a takeover. Six of the districts are working with the state to make improvements, and officials hope the <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> action sends a signal that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> is ready to act again if a district fails to make the grade.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Betrayed''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Costa-Gavras </PERSON> is unique among world-class filmmakers. He alone has made a career of polemics on such issues as military dictatorships -LRB- `` Z'' -RRB- and American meddling abroad -LRB- `` Missing'' -RRB-. His films have swayed world opinion while gripping audiences with his documentary-style drama. Because no one else attacks social ills on a regular basis, it is regrettable that he stumbles with `` Betrayed.'' The film begins with a Costa-Gavras imprint: a graphic depiction of heart-pounding violence. Over the titles, an acerbic radio talk-show host spouts insults at his favorite targets: rock music, fat women and bigots. As he leaves the studio, he is followed by another car, then is gunned down in a parking structure by unseen assailants. The episode, obviously inspired by the murder of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> broadcaster <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>, establishes the timeliness of `` Betrayed.'' But this early promise later dissipates in an illogical and overstated melodrama. A dedicated <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent, Debra Winger, unwillingly accepts the assignment of trying to infiltrate a Midwestern hate group suspected of the broadcaster's murder. Posing as a harvester machine driver, she quickly ingratiates herself to a good ol' boy charmer, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Berenger </PERSON>. With his overalls, homespun manner and two small motherless children, he seems as <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> as a Big Mac. The romance grows, and marriage is proposed. But <PERSON> Berenger </PERSON> has a challenge for his wife-to-be: He wants her not only to approve of his secret paramiliatry society but to participate in its robberies and murders. An intriguing situation, but it is destroyed by overkill.

<HEAD>J.C. Penney Creates $700 Million Employee Stock Fund</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has borrowed $ 700 million to create a leveraged employee stock ownership plan in conjunction with an expanded stock buyback program, the retailing company announced Tuesday. The so-called LESOP, a tax-qualified employee benefit trust that invests in the sponsoring company's securities, will replace <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION>'s existing employee savings and profit-sharing retirement plan. <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> employees already own 15 percent of the company's 132 million common shares outstanding through their existing retirement plan. The LESOP is using the proceeds of the $ 700 million loan to purchase a new issue of convertible preferred stock from the company, officials said. The preferred stock is convertible into about 11.8 million shares of the company's common stock, about 9 percent of the currently outstanding common shares. <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> will use the $ 700 million it gets from the employee trust to buy back 15 million common shares from the public. Therefore, the employees will end up controlling 31.6 million common shares, or about 24.5 percent of the common shares that ultimately will be outstanding. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Penney </PERSON>'s chairman, said the plan would help boost shareholder value. `` We see these steps as strengthening the interests of our major constituencies: our investors, our consumers and our associates -LRB- employees -RRB-.'' `` It wo n't really have an effect on our day-to-day operation,'' said company spokesman <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>. `` As far as long term, it should boost our earnings per share, reduce costs, and increase our cash flow.'' Such employee stock ownership plans commonly have been implemented by corporations anxious to place a large block of their shares into friendly hands, thus helping thwart potential raids. <PERSON> Penney </PERSON>'s plan is the largest such LESOP yet created, according to some reports. <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> said it would redirect its annual contribution from the savings plan to the LESOP. Last year, those contributions were $ 50 million. <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> stock rose $ 1.87 -LCB- a share to $ 48.12 -LCB- Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>.

 The government's chief economic forecasting gauge suffered the steepest drop in eight months in July, but few analysts expect a substantial slackening in growth anytime soon. The 0.8 percent decline reported Tuesday in the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Index of Leading Economic Indicators was the biggest since last November, when the index dropped 1.0 percent in the aftermath of the October stock market crash. But economists noted that the index posted an exceptionally strong increase in June and cautioned against reading too much into a one-month downturn.

 The stock, bond and currency markets showed little reaction after the government reported a 0.8 percent drop in its main indicator of the economy's strength, the biggest decline since after the crash of the stock market. Tuesday's report actually comforted some economists and investors who feared the economy was expanding too rapidly, raising the danger of higher inflation, higher interest rates and eventually a recession. The government also said Tuesday that factory orders fell 3.5 percent in July, the biggest monthly drop since January 1987. But economists said the decline had little significance because it was caused mainly by a swing in the volatile category of defense orders. `` For those people who were worried that we were in for a major acceleration of inflation, these numbers probably calm some nerves,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Wefa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, economic forecasting firm. Stock prices generally rose Tuesday in a slow session, although the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 3.20 points to 2,038.23 after a 24-point gain on Monday. The dollar fell Tuesday against most major currencies, while bond prices finished slightly higher. The yield of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s 30-year bond, which falls when the market strengthens, dipped to 9.32 percent from 9.33 percent late Monday <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON> said the reports should help encourage the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to hold off on any further tightening moves unless new evidence of inflation surfaces. The decline in the leading indicators was the biggest since last November, when the index dropped 1.0 percent in the aftermath of the October stock market crash. Economists noted the index posted an exceptionally strong increase in June and cautioned against reading too much into a one-month downturn. `` Despite the declines, we're not going to have any slowing in the imminent future,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturing, which languished earlier in the decade because of the strong dollar, has rebounded. The weaker dollar has fueled a resurgence in sales of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> goods overseas and businesses have responded by spending more to upgrade and replace plant and equipment. But demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods has been so strong that some analysts are concerned that factory capacity will be strained, pushing prices higher. Factory orders, excluding the defense category, were down 0.7 percent in July following a healthy 2.9 percent gain in June. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahan </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Kleinwort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said that despite the overall drop in factory orders in July, `` there is very little evidence yet that the manufacturing sector is moderating.'' The economy, as measured by the gross national product, grew at a 3.3 percent annual rate in the three months ended in June and at a 3.4 percent pace in the first quarter. In an effort to ease inflationary pressures, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has attempted to dampen economic growth by boosting short-term interest rates since late March.

Wholesale heating oil for September rose 0.38 cent to 43.14 cents a gallon while other contract months also gained.

<HEAD>Controversy Mars Battle Against Software `Viruses'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Some rivals in the fight against computer `` viruses'' are spending a large portion of their time battling each other instead of their common enemy of software invaders. The bitter battle concerns which of two groups has the qualifications and impartiality to evaluate anti-virus software for potential customers. The competition could slow down progress in combating viruses. `` I personally know most of the people in this industry and I have never seen this kind of animosity,'' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Camenker </PERSON>, head of the PC users group of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday. The battle centers on products _ sometimes known as vaccines _ that are intended to deal with viruses, which can wreak havoc with computer programs. Viruses are tiny pieces of computer code that pranksters or other outsiders can secretly put into normal programs, which `` infect'' computers when used. Although they are rare and have done limited damage so far, viruses are feared because of their potential to be spread from one computer to another, wiping out millions of dollars' worth of data in minutes. Publicity over viruses such as the Israeli virus, the Christmas virus and the Pakistani Brain has led dozens of companies and individuals to create anti-viral software products, but there is no easy or reliable way for customers to know whether they work. Customers and producers agree on the need for an independent panel of experts to review the software. The question splitting the industry is who should be in charge. Pitted against each other are the 2-month-old <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and a loose collection of other computer figures, led by <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON>, a consultant in <LOCATION> Tappan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Highland </PERSON>, editor of <ORGANIZATION> Computers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Security magazine in <LOCATION> Elmont </LOCATION>, N.Y. The controversy heated up Monday with the publication of a front-page article on the debate in MIS Week, a weekly trade newspaper. Each side accuses the other of using sloppy techniques and manipulating the testing process for its own purposes. The intensity of the debate has left some software developers disgusted with the whole business. `` We're not casting our lot with anyone,'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Glath </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> RG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Software </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Wilow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, who has nonetheless been loosely aligned with <PERSON> David </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION>. An independent testing panel is essential because most computer users have never seen a virus. If they had a useless defense, they would not know it until a virus invaded and caused problems. `` This kind of testing needs to be done professionally and carefully, particularly if other people are going to place reliance on it,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> has cautiously thrown his support behind the <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which was formed in June by a group led by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McAfee </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> InterPath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION> The group has eight corporate members. The industry association is assembling an independent university testing panel composed of people from three <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> metropolitan area colleges: Pace University, <ORGANIZATION> Adelphi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sarah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. The head of the university testing program is <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordani </PERSON>, who teaches computer science in the business schools of <LOCATION> Adelphi </LOCATION> and Pace. <PERSON> Cordani </PERSON> is a lieutenant colonel in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and has a part-time post in the computer security division of the Pentagon. <PERSON> David </PERSON> and <PERSON> Highland </PERSON> say <PERSON> Cordani </PERSON> and the three schools do n't seem to have the necessary credentials. They also say <ORGANIZATION> McAfee </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> InterPath </ORGANIZATION> products will have an advantage in the testing, which has not begun, because <ORGANIZATION> McAfee </ORGANIZATION> is the inventor of a virus simulator that will be used as one of the testing mechanisms. Highland is getting money from his magazine's British-based publisher, <ORGANIZATION> Elsevier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION>, for his own review of a range of anti-viral software, with the help of <PERSON> David </PERSON> and various consultants around the world. But <PERSON> Highland </PERSON> said he is not interested in operating an ongoing software review board: `` At the age of 71, I'd rather sit on the sidelines. I'm having more fun running a magazine.'' The virus issue is crucial enough that a major invitation-only symposium on it is scheduled in October by <ORGANIZATION> Deloitte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haskins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Sells and the <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Most major corporations and government agencies are probing the issue. For all the controversy over anti-viral products, computer security experts agree that the best protection against viruses is not new software, but prevention. That means being extremely careful about dangerous practices _ such as loading computers with software that is offered free on computer bulletin boards.

The two pleaded guilty to charges stemming from an alleged scheme that left <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> holding millions of dollars in bad energy loans from <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. Penn Square failed in 1982, and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> nearly collapsed two years later following an unprecedented run on its deposits. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Shadur </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> to 3 -LCB- years in prison, despite <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>'s pleas for probation. <PERSON> Shadur </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, who choked back tears as he spoke in his own defense, to a 2-year term. <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>, 53, and <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, 38, pleaded guilty June 30 to one criminal charge each for a scheme in which <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> allegedly took kickbacks in exchange for arranging to have <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> buy millions of dollars in risky energy loans from <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. The maximum sentence allowed under their plea bargain was five years. `` I'm going to be able to put a red circle on my calendar which signals the end of this affair,'' <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> told the judge before sentencing. He said he had lived under indictment for more than six years. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, who held his head and cried as he spoke, said he was sorry for his actions and was concerned about his family. He also had sought a sentence of probation and community service. `` I'm sorry for the people in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` I think of that a lot.'' <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Burck </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, said after the sentencing that `` We're relieved to have it behind us.'' <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said he was convinced the ordeal had harmed <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>'s long-term health He said <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> had to be carried from court when acquitted of charges in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> related to <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, only to find out the next day he had been indicted in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Testifying before his sentencing, <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> said he accepted responsibility for his actions. He asked the judge to sentence him to no more than six months in prison and assign him to work with the poor on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Shadur </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> seemed, at times, `` unwilling to confront the realities'' of what he had done. `` You allowed your conduct as a bank officer ... to be driven impermissibly by your desire for personal benefits,'' the judge told <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> pleaded guilty to misapplication of bank funds and <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> pleaded guilty to a charge that he aided and abetted <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>. The pleas came two months after a trial of the two ended with a deadlocked ury. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> had manipulated <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> and a third man, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> drilling contractor <PERSON> Jere </PERSON> <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON>, in schemes to save his own failing bank. <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON> was acquitted of wire fraud charges. Defense attorneys contended <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>, which was kept afloat by a $ 4.5 billion government bailout, was saddled with the troublesome energy loans because of an aggressive lending policy. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said his client was in over his head when assigned to handle <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>'s oil and gas leasing loans. He said it was a time of seemingly endless expansion, causing bankers to `` throw caution to the wind.''

<HEAD>Griffin Gets Resorts Stockholder Approval, But Not Nod From

 Entertainer <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> has received approval from a majority of <ORGANIZATION> Resorts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> stockholders to buy the gaming and real estate company, but state gaming regulators have thrown up a roadblock. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s proposed trust agreement _ needed before he can buy the Resorts stock from Class A shareholders and controlling stockholder <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> _ failed to win approval Tuesday from the state <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The trust agreement is necessary in case the commission finds <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> ineligible for a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> gaming license. In that case, the trust would run the company until <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> could appeal the decision or sell off the company's assets. The commission voted 3-2 against the proposed trust agreement, largely because it calls for a trustee to take control of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Griffin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> rather than just the Resorts stock. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> officials wanted the trust agreement to cover The <ORGANIZATION> Griffin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to ensure the firm can take advantage of prior tax losses of Resorts, potentially worth $ 100 million. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s deal to buy Resorts was to expire at midnight Tuesday, but <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Trump </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, said after the commission meeting that he expected <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> to extend the offer for another 30 days. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> was present at Tuesday's hearing, but did not testify. The former talk show host said afterward he had asked the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> for clarification on the tax issue, and he still expects the deal to go through. Commissioners <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeitz </PERSON> and <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Waters </PERSON> argued that The <ORGANIZATION> Griffin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> did not do enough to satisfy the law concerning the structure of the trust. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> also must obtain approvals from the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> government where a Resorts facility is located, said Resorts President I.G. `` Jack'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. The deal also is contingent upon settlement of shareholder litigation now pending in the <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and another lawsuit by Showboat Hotel Casino. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, who owns Resorts Class B stock _ which has 100 times the voting power of the Class A stock _ will receive $ 135 a share, or about $ 96 million. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> will also receive another $ 63 million to break his management agreement with Resorts, and he will then buy the company's unfinished Taj Mahal casino project for $ 255 million. Holders of the 5.7 million Class A shares will receive $ 36 a share under <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s offer, or a total of $ 205.2 million. On Tuesday, holders of 2.9 million Class A shares _ just slightly over the number needed to approve the proposal _ agreed to accept <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s offer. More than 236,000 voted against the deal, and more than 58,000 abstained.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Upholds Ruling Against Bendectin Class-Action Suit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court panel has ruled in favor of the maker of the drug Bendectin in a class-action suit by some 1,150 plaintiffs who claimed the anti-nausea drug caused birth defects. The attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Merrell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceuticals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, maker of Bendectin, said the decision by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 6th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upholding a 1985 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision was the most important yet in Bendectin-related litigation, which has been active for years. `` It shows the plaintiffs' lawyers lost fair and square,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodside </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, <PERSON> Merrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Dow </PERSON>'s attorney. A federal court jury in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> decided in March 1985 after five weeks of testimony that the drug did not cause birth defects when taken in prescribed doses by pregnant women. The three-judge appeals panel upheld the verdict, as well as Judge <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>'s decision to keep the jury from seeing all plaintiffs who had birth defects. <ORGANIZATION> Woodside </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Merrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> has not asked that plaintiffs be removed in any of the individual Bendectin suits against <ORGANIZATION> Merrell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> in other courts, but was concerned that `` having hundreds of children testify'' may have distracted the jury and attorneys in the class-action case. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesley </PERSON>, one of the attorneys representing more than 800 individual suits in the class action, did not return phone calls Tuesday. Appeals Judge <PERSON> Nathaniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> dissented in part Tuesday by saying the judge should have first met with the excluded plaintiffs before denying them their day in court. The appeals court also affirmed <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>'s decision to split the trial into two parts. If the jury had found that the drug caused defects, there would have been subsequent trials to determine any negligence or damages. The court also upheld <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>'s ruling that the district court did not have jurisdiction in 80 of the 1,150 cases. Those 80 cases were dismissed or sent back to state court. An estimated 32 million pregnant women worldwide took Bendectin or its overseas version, Debendox, from 1956 to 1983. <PERSON> Merrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> voluntarily removed it from the market in 1983, although it maintains the drug is safe and does not cause birth defects in children. <PERSON> Merrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> said in a news release that it had won 22 jury verdicts or judgments in Bendectin birth defect suits, and was appealing four trial verdicts won by plaintiffs. <ORGANIZATION> Woodside </ORGANIZATION> said dozens of lawyers across the country were awaiting the appeals court ruling before deciding if they should file similar claims against the company, which is based in suburban Reading. `` It's going to have precedential effect all over the place,'' <ORGANIZATION> Woodside </ORGANIZATION> said. `` This opinion is a very thorough review of all the issues presented to the court of appeals.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has 140 fewer flights today, but because of a federal judge's ruling still employs 4,000 workers it wanted to lay off. Eastern is going ahead with previously announced plans to curtail service from 14 cities in the aftermath of an order Tuesday by U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>. The order allowed route cuts but barred the company from making mass layoffs without negotiating with its unions. `` Massive layoffs are not, and shall never be, business as usual,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> wrote in a 50-page opinion. `` The Railway Labor Act requires Eastern to bargain with its unions before taking unilateral action to eliminate 12 percent of its workforce.'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> signed a preliminary injunction barring Eastern from `` altering in any way the status quo working condition of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots, machinists and flight attendants. A trial will be scheduled later. Eastern President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> called the decision `` gravely wrong'' and said the carrier would file an emergency appeal. `` Eastern, like any <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> business, must be allowed to prune money-losing operations,'' Bakes said in a statement released at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters here. `` We must be able to take prudent, although sometimes painful, measures in the best interests of the company and our employees.'' Overall, Eastern is discontinuing 204 flights, mostly in the West and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, with some new flights resulting in a net reduction of 140 Eastern flights. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s opinion did not spell out what should happen to the employees whose jobs were salvaged, even though their duties were not. Union attorneys suggested they could be transferred, and leaders of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s three unions said they wanted to meet with management to discuss ways to cut costs without layoffs. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> 100, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s largest union with 12,000 workers of 32,500 Eastern employees, called the decision an opportunity for <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> to belie his reputation as `` the No 1 union-buster.'' `` We're not here as laborers trying to direct the business of the airline. We're trying to protect jobs,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vician </PERSON>, vice-chairman of the pilots' local. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, local president, said the flight attendants still were willing to offer a job-sharing and leave plan _ rejected earlier by management _ to save jobs and money Lawyers for the three unions submitted financial statements, and <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> ordered bonds of $ 25,000 each to indemnify the airline if the decision is reversed. Meanwhile, the airline said: `` Eastern's basic fall schedule remains intact. Travel agents and passengers can continue to book flights with full confidence that the schedule will be as announced.'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said the service cuts, which reduce <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s daily flights from 1,225 to 1,085, were financially motivated. Eastern says the route cuts will save $ 50 million monthly in operating costs, and the layoffs would have saved another $ 7 million monthly. Eastern posted a second-quarter net loss of $ 89.8 million, following a $ 64.5 million first-quarter loss and $ 182 million in 1987 losses. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> has warned it needs cash to keep <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, some $ 2 billion in debt when bought 2 -LCB- years ago, in operation. Spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said the airline has no plans to file for federal bankruptcy protection, as it had hinted before the ruling. `` The only court we're headed for is the court of appeals,'' he said. Union leaders say the federal courts, which have generally been ruling in their favor this year, probably would make it difficult for <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> to repeat his 1983 move at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, where he used federal Chapter 11 bankruptcy to void union contracts. The union leaders also noted <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s findings that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> had worsened <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s financial state by taking loans and payments totaling hundreds of millions of dollars from the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> carrier to <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> have exhibited an anti-union bias. `` It confirmed what we've been saying,'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said. `` This is a federal judge. It's not the unions anymore or our consultants talking.'' The cities Eastern is cutting are <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Martinique </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>; Minneapolis-St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>; <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>; Pointe-a-Pitre, <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indies </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla </LOCATION>. The company and its unions still have myriad court battles under way, including a union effort to reverse the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> sale and allow employees to buy Eastern. Continuing are contract talks with the Machinists and pilots. The Machinists, in federal mediation since January, will vote Sept. 15 on a company call for $ 161 million in annual wage concessions.

<HEAD>Senior Bank of Japan Officials Not Considering Rate Hike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Senior Bank of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> officials indicated that the central bank has no plans to raise its discount rate despite recent interest-rate hikes in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. At a briefing Wednesday for Japanese reporters, bank officials said it is part of the central bank's contribution to international policy coordination not to push up the key interest rate. The officials did not elaborate. The news sent the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar up sharply against the Japanese yen in foreign-exchange trading. Other central bank officials were quoted as saying that the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> might have to intervene to stop the yen's decline. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Bank of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> officials made the remarks after the dollar rose above 136 yen in European trading on the earlier reports that the Japanese central bank would not raise rates. Last week, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> raised its discount rate a half point and several European banks quickly followed. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> had made a similar move a few weeks earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> quoted some <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> officials as saying the yen-dollar rates have reached a level that should be watched very carefully and that action might be warranted if new movements in the currencies occur. The remarks appeared to indicate that the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> may intervene to brake the dollar's rise if the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency continues to advance. The central bank does n't want to see the yen slide further against the dollar because of concern about higher domestic inflation. The yen's sharp appreciation since late 1985 has helped to hold down domestic prices. But accelerated growth in money supply amid the present robust economic expansion and the yen's recent downturn have spawned worries about inflation. According to <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> officials said they would consider not only the yen's levels against the dollar but the pace of its decline and the strength of yen selling, in deciding whether or not to intervene against the dollar's rise. The senior <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> officials, who indicated that no rate hike is in the works, described the recent key rate increases by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European central banks as aimed at fighting inflation. They said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> rate increases `` honor the spirit'' of policy coordination by the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> major industrial countries, since it advocates stemming inflation in order to sustain world economic growth. The Group of Seven countries are the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Some foreign-exchange and money-market participants said Japanese monetary authorities have refrained from raising the discount rate because such a move would make Japanese funds more expensive overseas and may prove counterproductive in keeping the global economy on an expansionary track. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is a launching pad of investment funds for the world. The -LRB- <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB- and other industrialized countries would do whatever they could to keep <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> from raising interest rates further,'' said an official at <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>EEC Slaps Antidumping Duties On Korean, Japanese VCR Imports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday slapped provisional antidumping duties on exports of video cassette recorders from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> after complaints by domestic manufacturers. The duties follow a surge in VCR exports to the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> since 1985, primarily from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> who tripled its VCR exports to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in a year's time, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said. The duties affect three South Korean companies that account for all of that country's VCR exports, including <ORGANIZATION> Daewoo </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Goldstar </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Samsung </ORGANIZATION>. The Japanese companies affected are <ORGANIZATION> Funai </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION>. The commission said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s VCR exports into <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> surged from 75,000 in 1985, to 425,000 in 1986 and 1.22 million last year. Imports from the two Japanese companies more than doubled to 991,000 units in 1986, from 466,000 in 1985. In the first eight months of 1987, 762,000 <ORGANIZATION> Funai </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> VCRs entered the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, the commission said. The duties levied include 29.2 percent for <ORGANIZATION> Daewoo </ORGANIZATION>; 26.4 percent for <ORGANIZATION> Goldstar </ORGANIZATION>; 25.2 percent for <ORGANIZATION> Samsung </ORGANIZATION>; and 18 percent on <ORGANIZATION> Funai </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> VCRs. The level of the duties was fixed after a commission inquiry into the sharp rise of VCR imports. The Commission began its probe in September 1987 on a complaint by an <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> industry association representing producers of consumer electronics. The group complained that VCR imports from the three South Korean and two Japanese firms surged because of their artificially low prices. The group's members include <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> BV </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Grundig </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Telefunken </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fernsehen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> und </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rundfunk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GMBH </ORGANIZATION>, both of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ferguson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> The Commission said it found that the South Korean and Japanese companies sold VCRs in the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> at dumping prices, or at prices considered unfairly low. As a result, their combined share of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s VCR market rose to 30 percent last year from 8.6 percent in 1985. Since 1985, VCR purchases in the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> rose to 7 million from 5.8 million European Currency Units -LRB- or the equivalent of $ 7.7 from $ 6.38 million -RRB-, the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said. It concluded the market share gains of the South Korean and Japanese exporters were made at the expense of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s VCR industry and that their dumping prices lowered the sales and profit margins of their <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> competitors.

 The stock market headed higher today with a boost from a strong dollar and a modest decline in interest rates.

<TEXT>
 The nation's poverty rate was 13.5 percent last year, about the same as in 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reported today. That means 32.5 million Americans were living in poverty in 1987. In 1986, about 32.4 million people, or 13.6 percent of the population, were living in poverty. The <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> said the changes between 1986 and 1987 were `` not statistically significant.'' The slight decline in the poverty rate occurred despite the small increase in the total number of people living in poverty because the nation's population also grew during the period. The <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> also reported that Americans' median family income rose to $ 30,850 in 1987, a 1 percent increase from the year before after adjusting for the rise in consumer prices. The report said the nation's poverty rate for whites declined by 0.5 percentage point last year to 10.5 percent. The poverty rate for blacks was 33.1 percent, up 2 percentage points. The rate for Hispanics increased from 27.3 percent to 28.2 percent. Regionally, the poverty rate in the South was 16.1 percent, unchanged from the year before. In the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, the rate was 12.7 percent, down from 13 percent. The rate in the Far West was 12.6 percent, down from 13.2 percent, and in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, the poverty rate increased from 10.5 percent to 11 percent. Between 1986 and 1987 the gross national product grew 3.4 percent, while unemployment fell from 7 percent to 6.2 percent, according to government figures. Today's report on poverty in 1987 was prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> based on a survey of about 58,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> households last March. A survey of that size has a standard error of well under 1 percentage point. Median family income in 1986 was $ 29,458, up from $ 29,269 a year earlier. Median family income indicates that half of all families had more income than that and half less. Statisticians prefer to use medians to make comparisons, contending that averages can be distorted by a small number of families with extraordinarily large incomes. The 1987 poverty threshold varies according to family size, but the most commonly used figure is $ 11,612 for a family of four. That's up from $ 11,203 in 1986. While the rise or fall of national poverty figures tends to generate the most immediate attention, later debate is more likely to concentrate on smaller groups. In 1986, for example, while the national poverty rate was 13.6 percent, 19.8 percent of children under age 18 lived below the poverty level. For blacks, the poverty rate was 31.1 percent, including 42.7 percent of children under 18. Hispanics had a 27.3 percent overall rate, including 37.1 percent of youngsters. The national poverty rate was first calculated in 1959, when it was 22.4 percent. The rate fell steadily as national anti-poverty programs were developed, reaching a low point of 11.1 percent in 1973. Since then it's gone up and down, peaking at 15.2 percent in 1983. Federal officials take pains to point out, however, that the figures over time are not necessarily comparable because of the increase in anti-poverty programs, many of which help people without showing up in the official poverty count. That's because poverty status is based on cash income, and does not reflect non-cash benefits such as food stamps, Medicare and subsidized housing. If those things were counted as income, the 1986 poverty rate would have ranged between 9 percent and 12.5 percent, instead of the official 13.6 percent rate, federal officials said.

 Regulators say they are planning to spend billions of federal dollars over the next 10 days in several transactions to rescue ailing savings and loan institutions. <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said late Tuesday the board was working on several deals. He declined to say where the next transaction would take place and said none of the anticipated federal rescues have received final approval. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Tulsa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> said in today's editions that the bank board's next move likely would come in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> with the consolidation of 14 of the state's most troubled savings institutions into six holding companies. <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON> said the board was meeting today but would not reveal what it was considering. In a report attributed to unidentified officials in the office of Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Inhofe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Okla </LOCATION>., the newspaper said regulators plan to sell the holding companies to the highest bidder, thus placing 14 of the state's 48 <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls under new ownership Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> in today's editions said the bank board was preparing this week to spend $ 1.2 billion to sell or merge `` a dozen or so'' institutions somewhere in the Southwest. <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON> said that if all goes according to plan over the next week and a half, the bank board will spend substantially more than that in several large transactions in a number of states. In recent weeks, the board has announced it was spending more than $ 8 billion to assist ailing S & amp; Ls, including a major deal in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which like <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> has been hard hit by the depression in the oil drilling industry. On another front, the bank board was facing a self-imposed deadline to wrap up negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> M. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which is seeking federal assistance to acquire <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stockton </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, one of the nation's largest S & amp; Ls. The board began negotiating with the <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> exclusively on April 21 and twice has extended the deadline, with the most recent extension expiring Thursday. <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON> said the board would have an announcement regarding American by Thursday. Industry sources have said between $ 1.3 billion and $ 2 billion in federal money will be required for the rescue.

<HEAD>Government Urges More Cautious Approach To Price Reform</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Top Chinese government officials have decided against rapid decontrol of state-set prices, a key element in the nation's economic reforms, in an apparent move to ease unhappiness with spiraling inflation. The cautious approach toward price reform disclosed Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Cabinet, differed from a more aggressive outline adopted by the Communist Party Politburo in mid-August, and highlighted the growing debate within the leadership over how fast <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> should proceed with its reforms. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s stand was widely reported in the official media Wednesday, with the national evening news devoting five minutes to explaining the decisions made. The council agreed not to initiate further price increases for the remainder of this year and decided there will be no radical reforms in the price system next year. The nation will continue to restrain construction projects and other capital investments that have pushed industrial growth to unsustainable levels and will further control credit and the issuance of currency to cool off the overheated economy, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said. It also said a five-year plan of price and wage reform outlined by the Politburo in mid-August is still tentative and subject to revision. The Politburo plan called for removal of price controls on most commodities in favor of market regulation. The plan, while also stressing the need to control a near-runaway inflation rate, said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economy `` is full of vitality and is developing vigorously. The time is favorable to the price and wage reforms.'' The 17-member Politburo, the main decision-making body of the party, is led by General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, the leading advocate of rapid market-oriented reform. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, is headed by Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, who is thought to be more cautious toward change and more concerned about the effects of reform on economic and social stability. There is consensus in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> about the pressing need for price reform, primarily the removal of state controls so that the value of goods can be determined by market forces. Artificially low state-set prices for many products have led to chronic shortages, corruption, influence peddling and a thriving black market. Profiteers commonly buy up low-priced raw materials and items from state factories and resell them for far higher prices to producers and consumers. Decontrol of prices of some basic goods and foods in the past year, coupled with the inability of producers to meet rising consumer demand, have pushed inflation to levels never before acknowledged in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s communist system. In June prices were 19 percent higher than a year earlier.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures opened mostly lower today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to extend price-support loans scheduled to mature today, analysts said. Unless the loans are extended, as was recommended Tuesday by a federal magistrate in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, an estimated 400 million to 500 million bushels of corn will be released onto the market. The magistrate's recommendation is not binding but it will be considered by the judge hearing a case brought by several farmers who are seeking to have the loans extended. `` The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> feels as though they've got a mandate to make their own decisions with regard to extending loans, which they say they will not do, and people are worried about an influx of old-crop corn coming to the market,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, grain specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He said the bearish impact of the potential loan expirations was offset by an increase in grain export business, which was keeping prices from falling significantly. In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 2 cents lower with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.94 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 2 cents lower to 1 -LCB- cents higher with September at $ 2.77 a bushel; oats were 1 -LCB- cents to 3 cents lower with September at $ 2.51 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 1 -LCB- cents to 4 -LCB- cents lower with September at $ 8.42 -LCB- a bushel. Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .55 cent lower to .10 cent higher with October at 71.85 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to .35 cent lower with September at 81.47 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to .37 cent lower with October at 39.05 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .48 cent lower to .78 cent higher with February at 50.55 cents a pound. Livestock and meat futures settled sharply lower on Tuesday.

<HEAD>Demographics Suggest Housing Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For at least one industry, housing _ including building, sales and rentals _ the script was written in the 1950s and 1960s and will be played out in the 1990s. The plot is a demographic one: A two-decade bulge of Americans of homebuying age will have passed through the economy, leaving a still large but substantially smaller demand for lower-priced starter homes. Among the characters affected will be developers, lenders, builders, trades people, brokers, materials suppliers and investors. `` They have no choice but to accept that notion and accommodate themselves to the reality,'' says <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wooten </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Lomas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, and publisher of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION>, a subscription newsletter. The latest analysis by the newsletter, whose surveys and studies are widely accepted in the housing industry, offers these demographic-based projections: _ Annual household formations gradually will fall to less than two-thirds of the 1984-1987 average _ Private housing starts will average no more than 1.4 million a year for most of the decade of the 1990s, compared with 2 million in 1977 and more than 1.7 million in the years 1983-1985 _ New housing will shift inexorably toward higher price ranges, reflecting the greater affluence and grander lifestyles of older buyers _ Traditional rental apartments aimed at younger tenants will be in less demand Says <PERSON> Wooten </PERSON>: `` Landlords will need to find innovative products to attract households in higher age brackets.'' _ Housing targeted for older Americans _ those retired or planning retirement _ will be find a growing market <PERSON> Wooten </PERSON> butresses his conclusions with immutable demographic evidence: In 1975, for example, nearly 40 million Americans were in their 20s, the primary market bracket for apartments and starter homes, while only 23 million were in the `` move-up'' category of 35 years to 44 years. By the end of the century the numbers will almost flipflop, with more than 43 million individuals in the age 35 to 44 bracket, while those in their 20s will have contracted to 34 million. These numbers portend a development that might also have a serious impact on those who currently own homes and are relying on the equity in them to finance their retirements. <PERSON> Wooten </PERSON> describes the potential phenomenon in this way: `` As <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> ages, as the middle-years cohort climbs the ladder from first moveup and thence to second, third and fourth, the lower rungs will be holding fewer and fewer potential buyers. `` The homes being left behind will be offered to a dwindling list of prospects. `` Thus, in overall terms, the existing-home market will gradually evolve into a buyers' market, beginning in the lower regions of the price spectrum.'' The situation <PERSON> Wooten </PERSON> describes does n't dictate lower prices, nor does it mean that prices can not increase. But it strongly suggests that the sharp price increases of the 1970s and 1980s will be, by the year 2000, a thing of the past.

<TEXT>
 A federal probe into accounting procedures at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, involving a possible attempt to avoid paying $ 50 million in taxes, may involve other companies and individuals, the government says. Court documents made public Tuesday showed the investigation now focuses on <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>, its parent, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and the Big Eight accounting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Andersen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>, who confirmed the investigation, said the probe is continuing and may involve others. Meanwhile, the state <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said today it has upgraded its own investigation of tax and accounting practices at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> and specifically wants to know whether the utility attempted to hide vital financial information from <ORGANIZATION> PSC </ORGANIZATION> scrutiny. <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> refused to elaborate beyond what was in the court papers because a grand jury is still hearing details. He said the investigation involves possible criminal wrongdoing, including violations of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Tax Code. A statement issued by <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> from the company's <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> headquarters denied any wrongdoing. But <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON>, speaking for the electric utility and <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said he was shocked by the allegations and vowed to `` get to the bottom of this matter.'' The papers raised the question of whether the companies and their accountants sought to hide about $ 61 million in spare parts to avoid paying $ 50 million in federal taxes, interest and penalties. Key elements in that question are whether parts are classified as emergency spares or for maintainence and when they become expenses to the company. The papers also raised the question of <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>'s accounting for the sale of 5 percent of the Vogtle nuclear power plant to the <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> In the documents, officials say the deal was treated as a sale of 5 percent of the $ 8.87 billion plant for book value purposes, but as 1.35 percent for tax purposes, saving the company between $ 10 million and $ 12 million. The papers include excerpts of taped conversations in which <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s tax chief agrees with an informant that the company misled the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> over the tax accounting of the spare parts, but adds, `` Do n't ever say that.'' The investigation, dating to 1982, is based largely on information contained in taped conversations between utility and <LOCATION> Andersen </LOCATION> officials and the informant, <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> employee <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON>, who is getting paid for his participation and been exempted from prosecution, the court papers show. The papers also include affidavits requesting search warrants at the downtown <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> headquarters of <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> as well as the home of <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fallaw </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s director of taxes. The affidavit by <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> alleges <LOCATION> Fallaw </LOCATION> and at least five <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> employees and four <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> employees knowingly participated in a scheme to hide the incorrect accounting of spare parts.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge has dismissed an attempt by the younger brother of <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> to gain one-third ownership of the world's largest winery. However, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> ruled Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> E </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; J Gallo Winery's trademark infringement suit against <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> will proceed to trial on Nov. 15. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> had charged that use of <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>'s last name on a brand of cheese he produced violated their trademark <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> countersued, contending that his older brothers comingled assets from their parents' estate to begin the <LOCATION> Modesto </LOCATION>, Calif.-based Gallo Winery in 1933. Price said he found no legal basis for <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>'s contention. The judge said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>'s allegation that <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> concealed part of the parents' estate `` clearly fails.'' Price said evidence presented to the court of the <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> family making wine before prohibition is `` mostly the stuff that family anecdotes are made of.'' `` The court can only conclude that <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON>'s administration was appropriate and that all of the assets of the estate were reported and administered,'' the judge said. `` It was always our belief that once the true facts were known, this ludicrous and false claim would be thrown out of court,'' Gallo Winery spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said. Attorney <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said he will continue trying to let <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> use his own name on his own products. `` I continue to believe <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> is entitled to use his own name in his own business,'' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said. `` We intend to move forward with that phase of the case at the appropriate time.'' Price said several issues must be resolved in the trademark trial. They include a contention by <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> that the winery made false statements in applying for a trademark to the name <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>, which means rooster in Italian. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> contended that their father began using the trademark in 1909. `` The court can not say that a fraud was practiced upon the trademark officials by the winery during the registration process,'' Price said. `` It is simply the position of the court that the record does not establish that the statements made to secure the trademark, as a matter of law, bar the winery from the relief it seeks. `` That issue remains for trial,'' he said.

<HEAD>Judge Sentences Bottling Company to `Corporate Imprisonment'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge said his sentence of `` corporate imprisonment'' for a soft-drink bottling company convicted of price fixing was unprecedented, but was justified for a company that `` did not have a conscience.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doumar </PERSON> suspended the sentence and placed <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bottling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> on probation Tuesday, saying any violation of probation would result in the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Marshal being sent to `` padlock every facility Allegheny owns.'' <PERSON> Doumar </PERSON> also imposed the maximum fine of $ 1 million, suspending $ 50,000 and ordering four top corporate officers to perform as much as two years of full-time, unpaid community service. `` The corporation can not come in here, profit to the tune of $ 10 million and walk away with a $ 1 million fine,'' <PERSON> Doumar </PERSON> said. `` I can not imagine any company being more tied up with illegal activity.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, a lawyer for <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION>, said he would appeal the sentence, adding that he could find no precedent of corporate imprisonment. <PERSON> Doumar </PERSON> also ordered that <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bottling </ORGANIZATION> not sell any of its assets without the court's permission. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said <PERSON> Allegheny </PERSON>'s parent company, <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION>, had planned to sell some of <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION>'s assets this week and that the sentence could result in a `` financial fiasco.'' <PERSON> Doumar </PERSON> said he would consider the transactions in private but would not allow the company to be left with no one to fullfill the terms of probation. The government said <PERSON> Allegheny </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> bottling franchise, and its arch rival, <ORGANIZATION> Mid-Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bottlng </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, ended years of cola wars in 1982 by secretly rigging wholesale prices in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. Prosecutors said a number of executives, including <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> multimillionaire <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapides </PERSON>, who founded <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION>, orchestrated the conspiracy. <PERSON> Lapides </PERSON> later sold the company, which is now owned by <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Doumar </PERSON> said virtually every executive at <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> was in on the scheme. `` Where was there a beacon of some sanity?'' <PERSON> Doumar </PERSON> asked. `` Was there any? Did anyone care? Why did n't anyone care?'' `` Some 200 years ago, the Lord Chancellor of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> said, ` You can not expect a corporation to have a conscience when it has no soul to be damned and no body to be kicked ... Obviously, <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bottling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> did not have a conscience ...'' <PERSON> Doumar </PERSON> said he could find no similar case of corporate imprisonment to justify his sentence, but added, `` stone walls do not a prison make.'' He said the sentence would discourage other potential price fixers from making illegal agreements with competitors. <PERSON> Lapides </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Harford </PERSON>, former president of <LOCATION> Mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coca-Cola </LOCATION>, were found guilty by a federal jury in May of price fixing. Last week, <PERSON> Lapides </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harford </PERSON> received three-year prison terms, with all but six months suspended, and were fined $ 100,000 each.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, the publishing group headed by British media tycoon <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, on Wednesday reported a slight increase in its first-half profits The company said it earned 71.9 million pounds, or about $ 121 million before taxes in the period ended June 30, up 2 percent from 70.5 million pounds, or $ 118.6 million, in the first half of 1987. Revenue jumped 37 percent to 505.7 million pounds, or $ 851 million, from 370.2 million pounds, or $ 623 million. A Maxwell spokesman said most of the gains came from the company's core publishing businesses. Professional and electronic publishing both enjoyed an outstanding half-year, he said. The core businesses are now being positioned within <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> ahead of the freeing of trade barriers within the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> in 1992, the spokesman said. The company's publishing services in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are to be offered in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has discussed a takeover of part or all of the company with <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which has an outstanding $ 2.34 billion tender offer for the publishing and information services concern, both sides said Wednesday. <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> had rejected <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s current $ 80-a-share tender offer as inadequate. But the company said it has provided London-based Maxwell with information on its operations. The information pertains to <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> as a whole as well as its information services group. <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> said in a statement its chairman and chief executive officer, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, met with British media tycoon <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> on Tuesday to discuss a takeover of all or part of the company. `` We have an agreement to hold talks,'' said a Maxwell spokesman in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> previously had expressed interest in acquiring only the information services operation, a unit that could fetch as much as $ 1.1 billion. Separately, <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said in a filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> it has received permission to proceed with the bid and acquire more than 50 percent of <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>. Federal regulators allowed the time period in which they must raise antitrust concerns to expire last week. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s bid topped a $ 75-a-share tender offer launched by the <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> M. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>, which owns about 9.2 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding shares. Bass' overtures prompted <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> to devise a restructuring plan that essentially would split the company in two and pay shareholders a special dividend. But a court blocked <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> from proceeding with its plan. The publishing company, which is appealing the court order, indicated recently it might sweeten its restructuring proposal but did not unveil any details. <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>'s shares consistently have traded above the $ 80 mark. In afternoon trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> was off $ 1.37 -LCB- at $ 82.24 a share.

 Deadpan comic, self-nominating presidential candidate and vintner <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Paulsen </PERSON>, who has been trying to sell his <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> winery for more than a year, has finally made a deal on the property, the company reported Wednesday. <PERSON> Paulsen </PERSON>'s general manager, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Litras </PERSON>, said the comedian's name will remain on the label and he will continue as the wine's prime promoter and He has agreed to make 40 public appearances a year for the wine. `` We hope to take full advantage of <PERSON> Pat </PERSON>'s marketing ability,'' said <PERSON> Litras </PERSON>, adding that the new owners hoped to raise production to 35,000 cases in less than two years. No sale price was named, but <PERSON> Paulsen </PERSON>'s 20,000-case winery and other property, including the 55-acre town of <LOCATION> Asti </LOCATION>, first listed for $ 3.7 million. The deal includes <PERSON> Paulsen </PERSON>'s 3.3-acre tasting room, delicatessen, gas station and some houses.

Wine sales plunged when <PERSON> Paulsen </PERSON> first put the winery on the market, as distributors feared the wine would not sell without his name. In May, in a move to assure distributors that the label was safe, <PERSON> Paulsen </PERSON> announced he would continue running the winery but was looking for an investor as partner. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Paulsen </PERSON> -RRB- has a national recognition and quite a large following, and that helps sales,'' <PERSON> Litras </PERSON> said at the time, adding that the wine itself was good enough to `` stand on its own merits.'' In 1985 and 1986, two <PERSON> Paulsen </PERSON> generic wines, $ 4.25 offerings labeled `` Refrigerator White,'' got very high marks for quality from the wine writers, following a 1.5-liter 1984 gamay that was lauded as superior and a buy at $ 6.50.

Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 4 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 592 up, 744 down and 541 unchanged.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> has reached tentative agreement with bondholders to settle its part in a giant lawsuit arising from <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>' 1983 default on bonds sold to finance two nuclear power plants, a supply system spokesman said today. Trial in the fraud and misrepresentation case is scheduled to begin Sept. 7 in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>. Remaining defendants include 19 public utilities in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, three engineering firms and a financial adviser firm to <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Britton </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Richland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, the tentative settlement was reached late Tuesday. He said the plaintiff bondholders had agreed to dismiss all claims against <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> based on securities fraud, misrepresentation and violation of state law. In exchange, `` We're not going to contest that we have an obligation to repay the bonds,'' said <PERSON> Britton </PERSON>. The agreement apparently means that while there will be little or no money involved, <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> would not contest any money that might be paid into an account for the two terminated plants, <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> Nos. 4 and 5. `` They -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- got out for the right price _ zero,'' <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Shigley </PERSON>, administrator for the <ORGANIZATION> Snohomish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, one of the largest remaining defendants, told the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Everett </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Wash </LOCATION>. Details of the agreement were being withheld pending a formal announcement from the federal court in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, which has jurisdiction over the case. The court clerk, <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, said there were no announcements from the court regarding a settlement. `` Well, it's not a done deal,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, attorney for bondholders who have alleged they were defrauded when they bought the bonds. <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, a plaintiff as trustee for bondholders in the case, has had control of the WPPSS 4-5 account since after default occurred in 1983. <PERSON> Britton </PERSON> said no insurance money was involved in the agreement. He also said the agreement must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> executive board, which has scheduled a special meeting Friday at 11 a.m. in <LOCATION> Richland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Britton </PERSON> said the tentative settlement would ask <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> to sever <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> from the suit and stay any proceedings agains the supply system. The process could last several months. In the legal action, dubbed Multi District Litigation 551, bondholders sued the supply system, 88 utilities, bond underwriters, various directors and managers, engineering firms and advisors after <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> defaulted on $ 2.25 billion worth of bonds. Many defendants have settled over the past year, for a total of $ 331 million. That includes bond underwriters and more than 60 utilities. The terminated plants are located at the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear reservation and Satsop, west of <LOCATION> Olympia </LOCATION>.

 Grain and soybean futures closed higher Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> on indications that a long awaited increase in foreign demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grains was beginning to surface. `` There's been a light pickup in overall business and people realize there's some pent-up demand in the marketplace,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, grain specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Prices had opened lower and made little movement until midday, following strong indications that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had purchased 300,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> was believed to have purchased 250,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat at subsidized prices while <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> reportedly bought 50,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybeans. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. At the close, wheat was -RCB- cent to 2 cents higher with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.97 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 4 cents to 7 cents higher with September at $ 2.83 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 7 cents to 14 cents higher with September at $ 8.54 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 2 cents higher with September at $ 2.56 -LCB- a bushel.

 <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday unveiled an electronic gateway that will allow computer users to reach several information services with a single local phone call. <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION>, the first <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> company to offer such a service, said its TranstexT Universal Gateway is available in the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> calling area. After the initial introduction there, <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> plans to make the gateway available in other cities in its nine-state region. `` We believe information services are an important'' segment of the telecommunications industry `` and it's important for our business to be involved,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> vice president for information services. But <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON>, alluding to several failed attempts by companies to launch videotex services, said <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> will proceed slowly and `` we're going to be listening a lot'' to see how information service providers and users respond to the gateway. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, in modifying the consent decree that stripped <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of its local <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> operating companies, ruled last year that <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies could establish gateways to transmit electronic information supplied by others. He continued to bar them, however, from originating any of the information themselves. Without a gateway, computer users with a modem must pre-subscribe to the various information services that are available and dial into each one separately. They also are billed by each separately. Using the <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> gateway, a computer user needs only to subscribe to it and can then dial one phone number to reach multiple information services. Subscribers will be billed by <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Networks </ORGANIZATION>, an unregulated subsidiary, for use of the gateway and for the information services they used. Currently, eight services are available through the gateway and 10 more are scheduled to be added soon, the company said. The services that are already on line offer information about an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> theater company, local and national news, the stock market and travel, among other things. One service sponsored by an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> hospital provides health and fitness information and plans soon to offer an on-line heart test. Another service allows callers to `` chat'' electronically with one another. <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON> said the company hoped to sign up 300 customers during the initial offering and slowly grow to 1,000 in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> before offering the service in other areas. Gateway charges are $ 1.50 per hour from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. and $ 3 per hour during the other 12 hours of the day. Users would be charged an additional fee depending on how much information they access _ typically about 60 cents during the day and 40 cents at night, <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON> said. Customers also must pay for the cost of access to any of the information services on the gateway. A couple of the services charge nothing, but the cost of others range up to $ 50 an hour. Computer users may pay more for some services obtained through the gateway than if they dialed into the service directly. But, depending on the time of day, some services may be cheaper through the gateway. For example, Travel Plus, which is part of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Videotex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Delphi </ORGANIZATION> service, charges $ 7.80 an hour on the gateway, day or night. But when a caller dials into <ORGANIZATION> Delphi </ORGANIZATION> and calls up Travel Plus, it costs $ 7.40 per hour during the evening but $ 17.40 during the day. The daytime rate reflects the higher cost of data lines needed for computer transmissions, said <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, marketing director of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Videotex </ORGANIZATION>.

 Oil companies submitted 371 bids totaling more than $ 190 million Wednesday in an effort to grab up bargain-priced leases on 270 tracts of offshore properties in the western Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The high bids ran to more than $ 131 million. <ORGANIZATION> Sohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> had the highest bid of the day with a $ 7.5 million offer for a tract in the <LOCATION> High </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> area off the Texas-Louisiana coast. The bid came to $ 1,306.24 per acre. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minerals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> opened the bids as several hundred oil industry executives looked on. It was the second offering of government-owned tracts in the western gulf and the third gulf lease sale since the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> dropped the minimum per-acre price on the property from $ 150 to $ 25. Interest was high, with 93 companies qualifying to bid. Eighty-four qualified last March for a similar offering in the central Gulf. However, when the number of submitted bids was totaled Tuesday afternoon, it was far below the 931 bids received last March for central Gulf properties. <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Angelico </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Minerals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the number was down for two reasons. The central Gulf waters are considered better risks and the western Gulf tracts were up for bids a year ago shortly after the minimum bids were lowered to $ 25 per acre. Almost 520 bids were received on the first western Gulf offerings. Almost 28 million acres of offshore property, mostly off the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> coast, were offered when the government announced the sale in July. That property was divided into 5,080 tracts.

 The stock market closed with some spotty losses today after an early advance faded. Stocks headed higher at the opening as the dollar climbed in foreign exchange on reports suggesting that Japanese officials planned no immediate move to increase interest rates. That, in turn, prompted slightly higher prices, and hence lower interest rates, for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government securities in the credit markets. Analysts also said hopes were increasing on Wall Street that Friday's report on the employment situation for August would show a moderation in job growth, which would presumably ease pressure for credit-tightening by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. With all those positives, however, the pace of trading remained relatively light as the long Labor Day weekend approached.

 The French publishing concern <ORGANIZATION> Hachette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to acquire a majority interest in the Spanish publishing firm <PERSON> Salvat </PERSON>, the two companies announced Wednesday. Terms were not disclosed, although the Spanish domestic news agency <ORGANIZATION> Europa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Hachette </ORGANIZATION> paid about $ 56.5 million for its stake.

 The dollar staged a strong advance Wednesday, bolstered by a sharp decline in the Japanese yen. Gold prices also moved higher. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold was bid at $ 430.30 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $ 428.35 late Tuesday. The dollar's gains came at the expense of the yen, which weakened anew in overseas trading after <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> officials hinted they would not raise their discount rate despite recent interest rate hikes in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` The yen went through the floor,'' said one dealer in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The dollar's gains against the yen encouraged it to climb against other currencies, dealers said. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the dollar jumped 1.59 yen to close at 136.52 yen. Earlier in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar rose to finish at 136.50 yen. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.58 yen to close at 134.97 yen. The yen began weakening late Tuesday on rumors that the Japanese government plans to impose a tax on certain stock-trading profits. `` Stories are going around left and right about what the Japanese may or may not do,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, a senior trader at <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. In domestic dealings, traders noted that the dollar closed off its session highs. `` There was some profit-taking and some month-end squaring'' of positions, noted <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, chief dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office. `` The dollar reached the stage where -LRB- <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> said it would do anything to defend the mark,'' he said, prompting traders to sell dollars. The central banks did not intervene to halt the dollar's rise. But dealers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> said they fear the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> will enter the market if the dollar tops the 1.8800 level against the mark. The dollar gained against the British pound. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> it cost $ 1.6830 to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.6910 late Tuesday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> it cost $ 1.6860 to buy one pound, less expensive than Tuesday's $ 1.6875. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday, included: 1.8765 West German marks, up from 1.8664; 1.5848 Swiss francs, up from 1.5765; 6.3740 French francs, up from 6.3385; 1,394.50 Italian lire, up from 1,386.00, and 1.2392 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2362.

<HEAD>Deadline Arrives For Rainfall Under Disputed Drought Insurance
Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 At <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, summer ended at midnight Wednesday, the cutoff for measuring rainfall under the insurer's controversial drought coverage plan that has farmers suing, insurance departments angry and <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> officials struggling for damage control A spokeswoman at the <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, N.J.-based company, who spoke on condition that she not be identified by name, said several weeks would be needed to determine the amount of <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION>'s liability. The insurer hopes to pay all claims by early October, she said. Reports from 1,100 U.S. Weather Measuring Stations will filter in to <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION>'s computer. Some of the stations are remote, making collection of the data more difficult, she said. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> officials have said that recent rainfall after dry weeks in June and July may have relieved it having to pay roughly half the $ 40 million in coverage granted. `` It's certainly been raining, and it's substantially reduced our exposure,'' said the spokeswoman. The policies, granted to 1,160 farmers, promise payments if rainfall is less than half _ or less than 70 percent, depending on the policy _ of an area's average rainfall from June 1 to Aug. 31. A check Wednesday with weather officials in Farm Belt states showed a range of roughly calculated rainfall levels for the eriod, though it is difficult to estimate what the effect might be on <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION>'s liability. In <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, about 15 percent of the state had less than half normal rainfall; 55 percent to 60 percent received less than the 70 percent threshhold. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> reported that less than 10 percent of the state fell below the halfway mark and just under half had less than 70 percent of the average. Rainfall in more than two-thirds of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> dipped below 70 percent of the average, and one-fifth was below 50 percent. In <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, more than half the state received less than 50 percent of normal rainfall from April 1 to Aug. 1, and nearly all of it dipped below 70 percent. Twenty-two counties in the southeast quarter of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> alone received less than 70 percent of normal rain since January. Figures since June were not available. Weather officials in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, said rainfall was about 22 percent shy of normal for the June 1-Aug. 31 period, and that conditions in the rest of the state appeared similar The Chubb policy became embroiled in controversy when the company was flooded with applications that exceeded the amount of coverage it had authorized. Agents offered an estimated $ 400 million in insurance compared to the $ 30 million limit, which <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> later increased to $ 40 million. About 8,700 farmers applied. Angered over the disparity, farmers sued <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> and the cases were consolidated in a class-action suit in federal court in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. Insurance regulators in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> have scheduled hearings on the issue. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> offered to return double the premiums paid by farmers who were denied a policy, and has sent about 6,000 checks totaling $ 20 million, the spokeswoman said. Midnight Wednesday was also the deadline for farmers to have letters postmarked asking for the doubled refunds. Lawyers for farmers in the <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> case said an agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> lawyers was filed promising that the double payments could be requested without forfeiting the right to sue. The Chubb spokeswoman said the promise was part of the company's original refund offer She also said the deadline would not be extended. She said most of the applying farmers had been contacted by telephone about the potential refund, but an unidentified numbers of others could not be reached and had been written. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> has reacted to the image crisis created by the controversey not just with the refunds but with full-page newspaper ads, toll-free numbers and a special task force staffed by 125 people. The volume of phone calls Wednesday was not heavier than usual, the company said.

The <ORGANIZATION> CBOE </ORGANIZATION> and floor traders responsible for making markets in certain options on the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 100 stock index violated federal law and the exchange's own rules by charging inflated prices for options contracts last Oct. 20, attorney <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Beigel </PERSON> alleged in a class-action lawsuit. `` The investors were gouged by virtue of being charged excessive prices,'' <PERSON> Beigel </PERSON>, a partner in the Chicago-based law firm <ORGANIZATION> Beigel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON>, said in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office. `` The market makers, with the assistance of the <ORGANIZATION> CBOE </ORGANIZATION>, deliberately charged investors very excessive prices, which made it difficult for the investors to make money because there was not a legitimate market.'' <ORGANIZATION> CBOE </ORGANIZATION> officials were aware of the lawsuit, which consolidates three previous class-action lawsuits, but would not comment on it, said spokesman <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Moulds </PERSON>. An option is a contract giving the holder the right to buy or sell a commodity or financial instrument for a specific price at a future date. In the case of <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 100 index options, the item being traded is the value of the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 100 index, which measures the performance of 100 stocks. The price or premium of an index option depends on a number of variables, including the time until the expiration of the option and the volatility of the underlying index. The <ORGANIZATION> CBOE </ORGANIZATION>, the world's leading options exchange, has said the doubling and tripling of index options prices on Oct. 20 were understandable in light of the market's unprecedented volatility that day. The exchange also facilitated the collection of $ 1.2 million earmarked as refunds for investors who paid extremely high prices for <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 100 index options contracts on Oct. 20. The money was collected from traders and distributed to brokerage firms. But <PERSON> Beigel </PERSON> said the refunds amounted to, at most, 20 percent of the total lost by some investors. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, combines and broadens the claims of the three previous lawsuits. It seeks an amount equal to the money invested less any returns or refunds, plus an unspecified amount for lost use of the money and interest. It names as plaintiffs all people who purchased OEX - or OEZ-series index options on Oct. 20 at the <ORGANIZATION> CBOE </ORGANIZATION>, except those who acted as market makers for such transactions The lawsuit names as defendants the <ORGANIZATION> CBOE </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Options </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clearing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a separate firm that processes trades made at the exchange; and all <ORGANIZATION> CBOE </ORGANIZATION> floor traders who were designated as market makers for the OEX and OEZ series of <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 100 index options on Oct. 20. Trading losses in index options on Oct. 19 and 20 have been estimated at several hundred million dollars nationwide. Index options were among the largest sources of investor complaints in the weeks after the 508-point drop in the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average on Oct. 19. Index options, which account for more than half the trading volume at the <ORGANIZATION> CBOE </ORGANIZATION>, are hedging tools that investors use to protect themselves against losses in the stock market.

 A former manager for <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> pleaded guilty Wednesday to mail fraud, completing the government's procurement fraud criminal case against the defense contractor, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Broome </PERSON>, 64, of <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, former product line manager of <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION>'s compresser components division, pleaded guilty in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to participating in a scheme to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said. As part of a plea bargain, the government agreed to dismiss five remaining counts and recommend probation in line with terms given to two other defendants already sentenced, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stickan </PERSON> said. Two more co-defendants are awaiting sentencing. All five co-defendants pleaded guilty. Broome will be sentenced after a report is filed with the court, <PERSON> Stickan </PERSON> said. No date for sentencing was set. The maxiumum penalty is a five years in prison and a $ 1,000 fine. The mail fraud charge involves the falsification of labor expenses in the manufacture of the TF-39 fan blade used in the C-5A military cargo plane, <PERSON> Stickan </PERSON> said.

 Businesses could unite workers at various locations in a telephone conference and create the illusion they are in the same room with a `` video wall,'' <ORGANIZATION> Bellcore </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday in unveiling a prototype. <ORGANIZATION> Bellcore </ORGANIZATION>, a research concern formed after the breakup of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said the video wall uses `` image merging'' techniques that bring together images generated by multiple cameras.

<HEAD>Cocoa Futures Hit 12-Year Low On Threat To International Accord</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Cocoa futures prices tumbled to a 12-year low Wednesday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after an official of the world's top cocoa-producing country said an international price-support agreement was dying. On other markets, pork futures fell sharply; crop futures gained; precious metals were higher; energy futures were lower; and stock-index futures retreated. The shaky price-support agreement of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> sustained another blow Wednesday when <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bra </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanon </PERSON>, agriculture minister of the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, told representatives of other producer nations he did not believe the <ORGANIZATION> ICCO </ORGANIZATION> would survive, analysts said. The <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, which produced 29 percent of the world's cocoa last year, has been withholding its cocoa beans from the market in hopes of selling them for higher prices. The <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> also owes about $ 48 million in cocoa levy fees to the <ORGANIZATION> ICCO </ORGANIZATION> to support its operations. <PERSON> Bra </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanon </PERSON>'s remarks Wednesday to a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Togo </LOCATION>, had a profound impact on the cocoa market, which had been looking forward to the <ORGANIZATION> ICCO </ORGANIZATION>'s scheduled two-week meeting beginning Sept. 5 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. At that meeting, consumer and producer nations are to begin negotiations toward a new international cocoa price-support agreement. `` A lot of people who may have believed the price of cocoa might rally because of the upcoming meeting were very demoralized,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON>, cocoa market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Because of the reluctance of the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and other producers to pay levies, `` the <ORGANIZATION> ICCO </ORGANIZATION> is facing very, very severe financial problems,'' he said. `` How are they going to enforce economic provisions to support prices if they do n't have the cash to keep going?'' In addition to those factors, a glut of cocoa is expected in the upcoming marketing year, which begins Oct. 1. Cocoa settled $ 44 to $ 60 lower with the contract for delivery in September at $ 1,220 per metric ton. Frozen pork-belly futures plunged the permitted 2-cents-a-pound limit on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in a third day of sharp declines in the pork complex. Hog slaughters are increasing on a seasonal basis, and the movement of hogs to market is being accelerated by the earlier-than-normal maturation of corn and soybean crops, analysts said. `` I have a feeling that producers are getting their pens cleaned up and getting ready to turn their attention to the harvest here pretty quick,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Durchholz </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Agri-Visor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, Ill. Most cattle futures moved lower on signs of slackening demand for beef, he said. Live cattle were unchanged to .63 cent lower with October at 71.77 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .22 cent lower to .10 cent higher with September at 81.70 cents a pound; hogs were .48 cent to .95 cent lower with October at 38.55 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.42 cents to 2 cents lower with February at 48.90 cents a pound. Grain and soybean futures finished higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> on indications that a long-awaited increase in foreign demand was beginning to surface, analysts said. Prices had opened lower and made little movement until midday, following strong indications that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had purchased 300,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> purchased 250,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat at subsidized prices while <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> reportedly bought 50,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybeans. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds. Wheat settled 1 cent to 2 cents higher with September at $ 3.97 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 4 cents to 6 -RCB- cents higher with September at $ 2.83 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 2 cents higher with September at $ 2.56 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 7 -LCB- cents to 14 cents higher with September at $ 8.54 -LCB- a bushel. Platinum led the precious-metals complex higher in a bounce inspired by technical factors, analysts said. Platinum on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> settled $ 7.80 to $ 8.10 higher with October at $ 533.90 a troy ounce. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold was $ 2.20 to $ 2.50 higher with October at $ 434.10 a troy ounce; silver was 4.5 cents to 6.6 cents higher with September at $ 6.556 a troy ounce Energy futures settled lower on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 9 cents to 28 cents lower with October at $ 15.18 a barrel; heating oil was .19 cent to .61 cent lower with September at 42.95 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .35 cent to 1.49 cents lower with September at 46.54 cents a gallon. Stock-index futures retreated on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for September delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 1.10 points lower at 261.60.

<TEXT>
 American family income rose by 1 percent last year but the number of people living in poverty also edged upward slightly, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reported ednesday. `` The economic recovery is leaving many poor Americans behind,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a private research group. He said the most disturbing figures dealt with black Americans, who suffered a significant increase in poverty. The government defined the poverty income level as $ 11,611 for a family of four in 1987, up from $ 11,203 the previous year. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Butz </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>'s associate director for demographic programs, said the nation's `` economic performance, in terms of income and poverty, has been mixed'' as usual. The number of Americans living in poverty last year totaled 32.5 million, slightly higher than the 32.4 million reported for 1986. The poverty rate was 13.5 percent, down from 13.6 percent. <PERSON> Butz </PERSON> said neither change is considered statistically significant because they are within the margin of possible error in the report, which was based on a sample of about 60,000 households across the country. It is possible for the poverty rate to decline even when more people are poor because the size of the population is growing faster than the number of people living in poverty. Median family income last year was $ 30,850, up from $ 30,534 the year before, the bureau said. The poverty report was likely to generate controversy in the presidential election campaign because of its bad news for blacks. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, said in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> that the report provides `` further evidence that the most effective means of improving the life of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> is a strong, productive economy.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the increase in poverty among blacks `` obviously is disappointing,'' but that women were `` making the greatest gains.'' `` We think this is a good report,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` It documents a decrease in poverty, a continuing rising income and reflects a growing, strong economy.'' <PERSON> Butz </PERSON> saw the figures somewhat differently. `` The poverty rate for blacks increased, but not for whites,'' <PERSON> Butz </PERSON> said. `` Income went up for whites, but not for blacks.'' But <PERSON> Butz </PERSON> said it is premature to consider this a trend. The poverty rate for blacks increased from 31.1 percent in 1986 to 33.1 percent last year, the study said, meaning the number of blacks living in poverty rose from 8.9 million to 9.7 million. Median family income for blacks fell from $ 18,247 to $ 18,098, while the median income for white families rose from $ 31,935 to $ 32,274. The poverty rate for whites dipped from 11 percent to 10.5 percent, indicating there were 21.4 million whites living in poverty last year _ down from 22.2 million a year earlier. For Hispanics the poverty rate rose from 27.3 percent to 28.2 percent and median family income fell from $ 20,726 to $ 20,306. The number of Hispanics in poverty rose from 5.1 million to 5.4 million. Median family income means half of all families receive more than that amount and half less. Statisticians prefer medians as a standard of comparison because a few families with extraordinarily high incomes can distort an average. Hispanics can not be counted in figures for blacks and whites because Hispanics are an ethnic rather than a racial group and already are included in figures for both blacks and whites, officials said. Farmers got good news in the report. The farm poverty rate plummeted from 19.6 percent in 1986 to 12.6 percent last year, meaning the number of farm residents living in poverty declined from 996,000 to 616,000. <PERSON> Butz </PERSON> said that while he had no immediate explanation for the decline, but cautioned that the figures do not reflect the economic hardships that farmers suffered because of this summer's widespread drought. The study found that women's incomes continue to trail those of men. It said women receive about 65 percent of males' take-home pay, a percentage that has remain unchanged since 1984. Families headed by a female with no husband present had a poverty rate of 34.3 percent, down slightly from 34.6 percent in 1986. Families headed by a man with no wife present had a poverty rate of 12.5 percent, up from 11.4 percent the year before. Children under age 18 had a poverty rate of 20.0 percent, not statistically different from the 19.8 percent of a year earlier. The rate for persons 65 and older was 12.2 percent, down from 12.4 percent in 1986. Even so, children made up about 40 percent of the nation's poor last year and the elderly accounted for 10.7 percent, meaning more than half of all poor people were the oldest and youngest Americans. The report said the poorest 20 percent of Americans account for only 4.6 percent if all income, a share that has declined from 5.5 percent in 1967. Over the same period, the wealthiest 20 percent increased their share of all income from 40.4 percent to 43.7 percent. The 60 percent of people in the middle received 54.1 percent of all income in 1967 and 51.7 percent last year. <PERSON> Butz </PERSON> said the poverty figures count only cash income, not anti-poverty programs such as food stamps, subsidized housing and <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>. If those benefits counted as income, he said, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> povetry rate would decline to between 8 percent and 12.5 percent.

<HEAD>Honeywell To Sell Four Units Serving Military Markets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it plans to sell four units in its Space and <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> business, which serve military markets. The units are its Electro-Optics Division in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>.; Training and <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Covina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> and Production Division in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and Signal Analysis Center in <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> said in a prepared statement. `` Our decision to sell these operations reflects <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>'s resolve to continue focusing on core businesses where we have a competitive advantage to assure that we can achieve our goals,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Renier </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> president and chief executive officer `` The units we intend to sell are good businesses which happen to fall outside the company's strategic focus,'' <PERSON> Renier </PERSON> said. In the space and aviation business, <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> is focusing on three strategic core businesses in the commercial aviation, military avionics and space markets, <PERSON> Renier </PERSON> said. `` This decision will allow us to concentrate on areas where we have significant market shares and will reduce our exposure in military markets where our competitive advantage is n't as strong,'' he said. In addition, <PERSON> Renier </PERSON> indicated proceeds from the sale of the four units could be applied to the reduction of debt, investment in the company's controls businesses, or the repurchase of stock. <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> said approximately 3,500 employees are employed at the four units being sold. The divisions' combined sales were about $ 430 million in 1987, or about 6 percent of the company's total sales of $ 6.7 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>'s space and aviation business sales totaled $ 1.9 billion in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>, an international control company that provides products, systems and services for the home and building, industrial, space and aviation, and defense and marine markets, has 79,000 employees worldwide.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday granted three foreign firms permission to acquire, start or maintain banks on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territory. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> was given permission to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> by merging it into <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which it already owns. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> First is the sixth-largest commerical bank in the state, with deposits of $ 4.7 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> is the fifth-largest, with deposits of $ 7.8 billion. The two combined will rank as fifth-largest. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toyko </ORGANIZATION> is the 22nd-largest bank in the world, with assets of $ 183 billion. Board member <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Seger </PERSON>, in a dissenting statement, said the Japanese bank, because it is required by its government to have less capital than is required in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, would have an unfair advantage over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> institutions. In another action, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> approved an application from the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seoul </ORGANIZATION>, the largest bank in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and the 147th largest in the world, to form <ORGANIZATION> Seoul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The board said the new bank would not have an adverse effect on competition among banks in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Seger </PERSON> also opposed the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> application. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> also approved an application by <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bilbao-Vizcaya </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> to own <LOCATION> Banco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Comercial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mayaguez </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bilbao-Vizcaya </ORGANIZATION> is being formed by the consolidation of two Spanish institutions, one of which already owns the Puerto Rican bank.

 <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest securities firm, is seeking a controlling interest in <ORGANIZATION> GNP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a mid-sized futures and options brokerage based in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, a GNP official said Wednesday. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Monieson </PERSON>, GNP's chief executive officer and one of its two shareholders, said GNP had held preliminary discussions with the Japanese firm. `` All we've done is that we are talking and we are continuing to talk,'' he said. `` There's no agreement at all.'' Control of GNP, an established trading firm with clearing status on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Options </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, would give <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> an edge over other <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> companies that are moving into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> futures and options markets. GNP's traders already have access to favorable positions in the best trading pits, while newcomers often must start on the fringes. Membership on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> futures and options exchanges will allow Japanese firms to use those instruments more easily to hedge against adverse movements in stock and bond markets. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> units of <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Yamaichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> gained full clearing membership on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> two weeks ago.

<HEAD>Tentative Agreement Reached Between WPPSS, Bondholders</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> has settled its part of a securities fraud lawsuit brought by bondholders after the system defaulted on $ 2.25 billion in bonds sold to finance two nuclear power plants, attorneys announced Wednesday. Plaintiff bondholders would drop claims against <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> in return for access to power plant accounts containing millions of dollars. Plaintiffs' attorneys also said the deal would gain them the cooperation of <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> employees, who will be leading witnesses in the trial set to start Sept. 7 in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>. Remaining defendants include 20 public utilities in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, three engineering firms and a firm that had provided <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> with financial advice. Attorneys reached the settlement, which had been proposed by the plaintiffs, late Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> Executive Board was expected to approve the agreement at a special meeting Friday in <LOCATION> Richland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Halvorson </PERSON>, board chairman. `` It's a very favorable settlement for the supply system,'' he said. The settlement also needs approval from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>, who is presiding over the WPPSS default case. Under the tentative settlement, the plaintiff bondholders agreed to dismiss all claims against <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> based on securities fraud, misrepresentation and violation of state law. <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> in turn agreed it had an obligation to pay the face value and interest on the bonds _ which would come to about $ 3 billion _ even though it paid no money in the settlement. The agreement also noted that because of limited assets pledged to secure the bonds, there was `` no expectation'' the money would ever be paid. However, the agreement did give bondholders unconditional access to an account for the terminated plants, Nos. 4 and 5, which has been under control of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, the trustee for plaintiff bondholders, since 1983. The account now has about $ 75 million in it and has withdrawn a total of about $ 90 million, mostly for attorneys' fees. Other additional funds the bondholders might realize from the settlement could come from a pending lawsuit seeking to wrest from two other <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> projects funds that were spent when those plants were `` twinned'' with the terminated projects. That could amount to tens of millions of dollars, but a determination is years away. `` Since you ca n't get blood out of a turnip, why not get all the other benefits you can,'' said <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, who represents class action plaintiffs in the giant lawsuit. The abrupt pullout of <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> from the litigation caught other defendants by surprise, and one said defendants were considering seeking a trial delay. `` We're surprised they -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- did n't stay and defend their actions ...,'' said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Shigley </PERSON>, administrator for the <ORGANIZATION> Snohomish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's not clear that we need more time -LRB- to prepare for trial -RRB-. There is a good chance we will be able to pull it together.'' In addition to access to funds, the settlement will allow plaintiffs to talk with supply system employees before they are put on the stand, according to <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, a plaintiffs' lawyer, Because of rules in a civil lawsuit, there were questions on whether the <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> employees even would have to testify. Bondholders had sued the supply system, 88 utilities, bond underwriters, various directors and managers, engineering firms and advisors after <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> defaulted on $ 2.25 billion worth of bonds to build the two never-completed nuclear power plants. Many defendants, including bond underwriters and more than 60 utilities, have reached settlements totaling $ 331 million over the past year.
