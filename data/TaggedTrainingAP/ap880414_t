<HEAD>Administration Bars NIH From Experiments On Aborted Fetal Tissue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The National Institutes of Health may not conduct experiments using tissue from aborted fetuses _ considered promising in early work on Parkinson's disease _ under a ruling by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, according to a published report. `` This is a very difficult process,'' Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Windom </PERSON>, assistant secretary of health at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday about his decision last week. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported the decision in Friday's editions. `` The morality and science are all mixed together,'' <PERSON> Windom </PERSON> said. `` They need to be evaluated before we rush ahead. We just ca n't afford to move too hastily on this.'' <PERSON> Windom </PERSON>'s decision was prompted by an <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> proposal to implant fetal tissue into patients with <ORGANIZATION> Parkinson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, the newspaper reported. <PERSON> Windom </PERSON>, in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyngaarden </PERSON>, said he was `` withholding my approval of the proposed experiments'' due to `` ethical and legal'' questions that had not been addressed satisfactorily. He directed <PERSON> Wyngaarden </PERSON> to create an outside advisory committee to examine such questions, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Windom </PERSON> wrote that he does not oppose the use of fetal tissue from miscarriages or stillbirths, but researchers contacted by the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said proper planning is necessary to retrieve the tissue while it is useful and that it is rarely possible to use fetuses that have been aborted spontaneously. Researchers contacted by the newspaper expressed dismay over the decision, with Dr. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Liebel </PERSON>, professor of medicine at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION>, saying: `` <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> sets the pace, and this will cripple fetal research in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ... It is an extraordinarily valuable research tool with immense potential. Depriving research scientists of this material is a great disservice to humanity.'' But abortion opponents praised the decision. `` If the parents were a part to the killing, they have no right to assign organs to another person,'' said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Willke </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right-to-life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` that is desecration of a corpse.''

 A car bomb blew up in front of a club for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> on Thursday, killing a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> enlisted woman and four Italians and wounding at least 17, officials said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast that happened shortly after 8 p.m. -LRB- 2 p.m. EDT -RRB- at the USO club. A <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> woman was stationed at <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> Master Station in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>. Lt. <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Mescus </PERSON>, the spokeswoman, said the woman's identity was being withheld pending notification of next of kin. Italian media quoted officials as saying four Italians were also killed. One of the bodies at the club's entrance was draped in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag. Lt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, said an undetermined number of crewmen from the frigates USS Capodanno and USS <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> were injured but that no sailor from either ship was killed. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said three sailors from the Capodanno and one from the <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> were admitted to the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval Hospital in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>. He said one crewman from the Capodanno was treated and returned to his ship. Italian media said the bomb exploded during a reception at the club for the commander of the USS Paul, a torpedo boat destroyer docked in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate official could not confirm the report. Passers-by screamed and ran when the explosion occurred outside the club, which is in one of <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>' busiest areas. `` I was in the store and we were getting ready to lower the shutters when the world exploded around us,'' said <PERSON> Valeria </PERSON> <PERSON> Spinetti </PERSON>, 22, an employee in a nearby shop. A spokesmen for <PERSON> Pellegrini </PERSON> <PERSON> Hospital </PERSON> said 14 of the wounded, including four Americans and eight Italians, were sent to the hospital. The spokesman, who asked not to be identified, said the Americans were moved to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military hospital. RAI, the state-run television network, said a 27-year-old Italian woman was in grave condition. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Capodanno </LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, and the <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Mayport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, were on routine deployment with 6th Fleet. Antonio Barrel, the inspector general of public security in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, told the Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> that authorities do not yet know if the car bomb was set by foreigners or Italians. But <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified police official as saying `` the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> connection seems most likely.'' Italian news media noted the blast occurred almost exactly two years after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warplanes bombed <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Benghazi </LOCATION> in retaliation for alleged <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> involvement in the bombing of a night club in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> that killed an American soldier. Investigators said the Thursday blast destroyed the inside of the club and wrecked cars on the street. The bomb apparently was hidden in a Ford Fiesta that was destroyed by the blast. Mescus identified three of the injured <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> servicemen as Chief Petty Officer <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Navalta </PERSON>, 39, of the USS <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, and Petty Officer 3rd Class <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Trent </PERSON>, 22, and Senior Chief Petty Officer <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Fifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, 38, both assiged to the USS Capodanno. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> identified a fourth injured sailor as <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, 27, an electronics technician on the Capodanno. He was in stable condition. <PERSON> Navalta </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Castillejos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambales </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Trent </PERSON>, from <PERSON> Gaither </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, were also in stable condition. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, Ill, was treated and released. `` Our sympathy goes out to the families and friends of those who were killed or injured in this brutal act,'' said World USO President <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagel </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The bombing was the fourth attack in seven years aginst <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> installations or personnel in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. In December 1981, <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION> terrorists disguised as plumbers kidnapped <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Brig. Gen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dozier </PERSON> from his home in <LOCATION> Verona </LOCATION>. He was freed 42 days later by a special police unit in <LOCATION> Padua </LOCATION>. In February 1984, terrorists in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> fatally shot <PERSON> Leamon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat and director-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Multinational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and Observers in the Sinai. The Red Brigades claimed responsibility. In June 1987, a car bomb exploded near the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and at least two rockets were fired at the embassy. There were no injuries. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has a major presence in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, headquarters for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s southern command and the support center for the 6th Fleet An average of 45 ships, 200 aircraft and over 23,000 people comprise the fleet, which is deployed in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> went quietly to his death in the electric chair Thursday night for strangling a neighbor during a 1980 robbery. <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON>, 33, was pronounced dead at 11:07 p.m., six minutes after the first of two, one-minute jolts of 2,500 volts each was administered, said state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON>. <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON>, who had escaped from death row in 1984, had no final statement and showed little emotion as he went to his death. The prison chaplain, <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, turned his back on the electric chair as the sentence was carried out. A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> earlier in the day had set the stage for the seventh execution in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> since 1982 when it unanimously overturned a stay granted Tuesday by a federal judge. Later Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in a 7-2 vote, denied a stay, and Gov. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> refused clemency an hour before <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON> went to his death. <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON> was convicted by a <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> jury in 1981 of murdering 38-year-old <PERSON> Wilhemina </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a school librarian who lived in his apartment building. He was on parole at the time for a 1972 murder conviction in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. The execution was the 98th in the nation since the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1976 allowed states to resume use of the death penalty. Besides his mother, a sister, two aunts and lawyers, <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON>'s last visitors included <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, the 1960s child TV star of `` <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> the Menace. North has been working on a movie about the 1984 escape of <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON> and five other <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> death row prisoners. `` We became extremely close friends,'' said <PERSON> North </PERSON>. `` We've been in contant communication, wrote and called. We became like brothers.'' About 50 death penalty opponents conducted a vigil and prayer service outside the prison. A single supporter of capital punishment shouted, `` Pray for the woman that died.'' The appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> had centered on abuse <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON> contended he suffered as a child but did not disclose until after being sentenced to death. The appeal cited a psychiatric report saying <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON> suppressed memories of his violent childhood, thus hampering defense efforts to present mitigating evidence that could have resulted in a life sentence. However, the federal appeals court said that <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON>'s case had been given least 10 reviews in state and federal courts and that his sentencing had been found constitutional. In addition, the court said, <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON>'s attorney had failed during a previous federal appeal to raise the issue of abuse. <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON> was one of six death row inmates who escaped from the <ORGANIZATION> Mecklenburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in 1984. He was recaptured a day later while eating cheese and drinking wine with another escapee at a coin laundry in <LOCATION> Warrenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>. At his 1981 trial, <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON> refused his lawyer's request to submit to a psychiatric examination, and the only mitigating evidence presented to the jury at his sentencing hearing was that he attended Bible classes while in jail awaiting trial After the trial, <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON> said he was beaten as a child by his father and was sexually abused by his stepmother. After leaving his father, he moved to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> to live with his mother and was convicted of a murder. He was later paroled.

 A rally of nearly 1,000 students at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> to protest a ban on alcohol at outdoor events was the largest demonstration in recent memory, a school spokeswoman said.

The alcohol ban was ordered last week by Chancellor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON>. Several students at Wednesday's hourlong rally carried beer cans and chanted `` <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>'s got ta go!''

 The one ton bronze statue of <ORGANIZATION> Rice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> has been festooned with such things as hats, coats and military regalia since it was placed on campus 58 years ago.

As he approached, the group scattered, said <ORGANIZATION> Campus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Voswinkel </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Voswinkel </PERSON> said the officer was able to stop one student, who was driving a pickup truck away from the quadrangle. The officer took the student's name and let him go, then sped back to the statue to investigate. The statue appeared intact _ but was facing the <LOCATION> Fondren </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Library </LOCATION> to the south instead of the Lovett Building to the north. It took 3 -LCB- hours for a crew of professional movers using a crane to fix the statue. `` It was a student prank,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Noblitt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>'s director of university relations. `` It was a rite-of-spring type thing.'' <PERSON> Noblitt </PERSON> said the vandalism could have had serious consequences because students apparently used an A-frame built from 4-by-6 beams to lift the statue. The devices that were found had cracked, and the statue could have fallen. The pranksters apparently climbed to the roof of the Architecture Building to disconnect the spotlight and had painted the A-frame black to help conceal it. The student who was questioned will face disciplinary action from the university, but officials did not release further details.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON> focuses on the blackboard with absorbed frustration. Reporters and photographers have invaded his classroom, and he's concerned his students are losing their concentration. Although his life and unorthodox teaching methods are the subject of the critically acclaimed film `` Stand and Deliver,'' <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON> has more important things on his mind _ like mathematics and helping his <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Garfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> students to learn as much as they can. `` We have so many people working at <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> in the Box -LRB- fast-food restaurants -RRB- and pumping gas,'' he said. Like the movie teacher portrayed by actor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmos </PERSON>, <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON> wants more for his students, and pushes them to excel in math and use it as their ticket out of menial jobs. `` It's like a sport,'' he said. `` You have to practice every day to be in shape.'' His scrapbooks chronicle the victories of his mathematical athletes. Photos show beaming students holding banners heralding their achievements. Each year the number of <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON> students passing the Advanced Placement calculus test, given by the <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Testing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> for college credit, has grown tremendously. In 1979, five students took the test and all had a passing mark of 3 or better. By last year, 87 <PERSON> Garfield </PERSON> students passed the test, higher than any other school in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The movie concerns an incident in 1982, when 18 students took the exam and all passed. Surprised that the predominantly Hispanic class had performed so well in a school that was about to lose its academic accreditation, the <ORGANIZATION> ETS </ORGANIZATION> accused the students of cheating. Twelve took the retest and passed with either perfect scores of 5 or near perfect scores of 4. Last year, scores made by <PERSON> Garfield </PERSON> students taking the Advanced Placement calculus test placed <PERSON> Garfield </PERSON> second in the nation out of the 4,197 schools with students taking the tough exam, said <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Gams </PERSON> with the <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Testing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Just 2 percent of American students even attempt the test. This year, a record 160 <PERSON> Garfield </PERSON> students are expected to take the test, and <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON> has set his sights on attracting even more students to calculus classes in the 10 more years he plans to continue teaching. `` He's your friend, he's your mentor and he's your father,'' said former student <PERSON> Josie </PERSON> <PERSON> Richkarday </PERSON>, who was one of the 18 students suspected of cheating. `` He just did n't teach,'' said <PERSON> Richkarday </PERSON>, 23, who is studying to be a math teacher herself. `` He brought something out of me. If you're willing to go 50 yards, he'll go 100.'' <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON> has seen `` Stand and Deliver'' four times and likes it, although he says 90 percent is true and 10 percent is hype because the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> release depicts more gang activity than really exists and portrays the families and neighborhoods as more destitute than they really are. His students have become doctors and engineers. They work at the <ORGANIZATION> Jet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Propulsion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, which does work for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, and for <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Richfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Islas </PERSON>, a 1976 <PERSON> Garfield </PERSON> graduate and an oral surgeon with two offices in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area, credits <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON> with challenging him to be more than a C student with athletic talent `` He was a fantastic instructor,'' <PERSON> Islas </PERSON> said. `` He kept you motivated, and his method of teaching was kind of unorthodox but I think in that particular environment that's what you needed.'' In the 14 years <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON> has been at <LOCATION> Garfield </LOCATION>, he has watched the gang influence dissipate, due mostly to a tough line by school administrators and teachers. The graffiti is more or less gone. And, thanks in part to the reputation of <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON>'s math achievers, the school is respected within the mostly Hispanic barrio, where neatly kept stucco homes reflect community pride. The days when students did n't want to go to <LOCATION> Garfield </LOCATION> are over, said <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Tostado </PERSON>, who grew up in the area. `` There's no longer the defeatist attitude that no matter what you do you're not going to get ahead,'' she said. Today, the school is well-known for academic prowess. <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON>, a 57-year-old father of two sons, was a respected teacher in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> for 11 years before coming to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at his wife's urging in 1964. Once here, he tried a career in computers but the work lacked the spirit of teaching. `` I got real tired,'' he said in an interview. `` I did n't want to deal anymore with the printouts or schematics.'' Now he spends his days in a stage-like arena before as many as 52 students who sit on tiered rows, and demands that late comers get `` The Chair,'' a tot's seat meant to embarrass tardy students into promptness. His classroom is plastered with posters designed to motivate. A foot-high banner curls around the room's corners, greeting students with: `` Calculus need not be made easy; it is easy already.'' Another poster tells students what they can expect to feel if they master math: `` Feel ready to attend any college or university. Feel prepared to go into real estate, business, engineering. Feel really good about myself.'' The students do feel good about themselves. Boredom is replaced with laughter, smiles and friendly jests, as <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON> tries to reach them through cheers, swats them with a battered and faded pillow, practices an imaginary ski swish and does practically anything to promote learning. He was given the nickname `` <PERSON> Kimo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabe </PERSON>'' by four gang toughs in his class. The name translates loosely from <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> as `` the one who knows.'' He's accepted the nickname, but shakes off such glorious titles as `` American hero,'' which <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> dubbed him in a recent story about the movie and teacher behind it. `` What I tried to do is improve things in my school,'' he said. `` He's a master,'' said <PERSON> Tostado </PERSON>, describing <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON>'s teaching `` He's a genius at it.'' News crews file in and out of his classroom almost daily now, but while the media intrusion disturbs him, <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON> believes the rewards from the movie's exposure will offset the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> glare. `` It's going to motivate parents to control, to help ... because the schools alone can not educate,'' he said. `` It's going to motivate the students. The teachers are going to see it's better to teach the way this guy does and and not from the desk.''

 The working class neighborhood that taught <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmos </PERSON> respect for humanity and watched the `` Miami Vice'' star mature into an acclaimed actor is home to his latest movie. <PERSON> Olmos </PERSON> returned to an <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> high school last spring to make `` Stand and Deliver,'' a movie about a magnetic, demanding math teacher who led an unruly Hispanic class to academic triumph in 1982. The 41-year-old actor was no stranger to the halls of <ORGANIZATION> Garfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. His cousin teaches computer science there. Only 1 -LCB- miles from his childhood home, it is ethnically mixed, like the neighborhood he remembers. `` Stand and Deliver'' was a smash when it opened in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. It brought in $ 411,000 during its first week last month, averaging $ 14,000 at each of 30 theaters, he said. <PERSON> Olmos </PERSON>, an actor of <PERSON> Mexican-American </PERSON> heritage who won an Emmy Award for his role as Lt. <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> series `` Miami Vice,'' was delighted with the movie and its reception in his home area. `` This film is probably the most inspirational film I've done to date,'' he said of the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> release. `` Stand and Deliver'' is about overcoming racial stigmas. It advances the humanities, something <PERSON> Olmos </PERSON> said he holds close to his heart; something he learned in a family of eight living in a neighborhood crowded with <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION>, Mexican, Jewish and American Indian families. <PERSON> Olmos </PERSON>, who co-produced and helped write the movie, claims he is not making a political point. `` I'm not a political animal,'' he said. It's the advancement of the humanities through acting that inspires <PERSON> Olmos </PERSON>. `` It's always been that way. It serves me well and makes me stronger,'' he said. `` That does n't mean I have to make message movies. I think that art forms, especially films, should be used to entertain. Now if by chance your entertaining and allowing -LRB- your audience -RRB- to experience an event that has some value and some substance and some awareness to it, well even better. `` The criterion, No. 1, is the story. If that story happens to be socially relevant, well that's wonderful, but if it is n't, that's OK too.'' `` Stand and Deliver'' is about an event that drew national attention to <ORGANIZATION> Garfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>'s 1982 calculus class. The predominantly Hispanic class took and passed an Advance Placement calculus test, in stark contrast to the rest of the school, which faced loss of accreditation. The 18 students, who were badgered and inspired by computer specialist-turned-teacher <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON>, were stripped of their honors when the <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Testing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which tests <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> students and provides their scores to colleges and universities, accused the entire class of cheating. In the movie, <PERSON> Olmos </PERSON>, in his role as <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON>, accuses the Educational Testing Service of racism. Students from wealthy <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> would not be questioned if they passed an Advance Placement calculus test, but students with Hispanic names from a barrio high school were suspect, he says in the movie. Eventually, the students are vindicated with a second test. The movie is not meant to be manipulative, <PERSON> Olmos </PERSON> said. It presents an event `` that allows you to experience with your own values.'' `` We do n't give results,'' he said. `` We only give the facts.''

<HEAD>Whisky-Maker Says San Francisco Water Not Good Enough</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The drought-threatened <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> region is getting a little help from an unlikely quarter _ the makers of Famous Grouse Scotch whisky. The manufacturers of the liquor, <ORGANIZATION> Matthew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gloag </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Sons of <LOCATION> Perth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, kicked off their latest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales campaign, but decided they could n't bear the thought that <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Franciscans </LOCATION> might mix their prized whisky with local tap water. `` The fact is that <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> tap water does not taste very good,'' said local Famous Grouse spokesman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>. So this month, it started selling a $ 14 package containing the scotch and a bottle of water from <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Strathmore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, a combination the company says is necessary to bring out the best features of the liquor. `` Serious scotch drinkers in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> have been loath to mix Famous Grouse with the infamous chlorinated city water,'' read several hundred invitations to a scotch and bagpipe bash Wednesday at a chic watering hole. Famous Grouse, stung by the mere 1.5 gallon-per-capita consumption of distilled spirits in this country, is trying to heighten the figure with a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> campaign initially targeting <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>. In the Bay region, a fringe benefit will be to ease ever so slightly the water shortage threatened by an exceptionally dry winter.

 Nation of Islam leader <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> told a cheering audience at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> `` you should thank God <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has emerged'' as a leading presidential candidate. The black Muslim minister, whose appearance set off a week of controversy and a protest rally by up to 1,000 people, brought most of the 2,000 in the auditorium to their feet when he said, `` <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is running to save a people; he is running to save the nation. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is growing up to respect men of wisdom in black skins, but it has n't grown up yet,'' <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, during his 1984 presidential campaign, accepted <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>'s support, leading to harsh criticism, particularly from Jews. <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> has been reported to have praised <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and called Judaism a gutter religion, but he denied Wednesday ever making the statements. During this campaign, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has had no contact with <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>. The Muslim minister, whose visit was guarded by strict security measures that cost the university $ 6,000, insisted that those opposing <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, especially in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary next week in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, are using `` me to galvanize Jews against <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.'' `` They are using me to try to derail him,'' he added. The comments came in two-hour speech in which he predicted, without being specific, that `` a very dark and tragic day is coming to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and to humanity.'' Over and over <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> told how whites dominate the western world. Referring to the days, more than 125 years ago, when blacks were slaves in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> said he was joining `` my dear Jewish friends in saying ` never again,''' referring to the phrase Jews use in condemning the Nazi Holocaust. `` I am considered a hater, but I am a reminder to the black people of what has happened to us,'' he said. `` For if we forget it will happen again.'' Before his evening speech, the black Muslim minister said the community would benefit by the controvery his visit has generated. `` Even though the atmosphere is charged, I did not charge it,'' he said at a news conference. `` My presence hopefully will help the students to judge me better.'' Students gathered for an hour-long demonstration before the speech, waving signs saying: `` Unity, Yes. Anti-Semitism, No.'' and `` Free Speech, Yes. Hatred, No.'' `` No matter what <PERSON> Farrahkan </PERSON> says, it does n't erase what he said in the past,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Genulka </PERSON>, the rally organizer and chairman of the Council of Jewish Students. `` We must work together as a community instead of being at odds.'' Last week, university officials refused a Jewish group's request to cancel the visit, saying they respected <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>'s right to free speech. A letter condemning <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> and signed by more than 700 students and teachers appeared in the Wednesday student paper. The visit comes in the wake of the 18-month suspension of a predominantly Jewish fraternity for hiring two black women to perform as strippers at a party. Party-goers reportedly shouted racial epithets. University President <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackney </PERSON> defended the Farrakhan visit. `` In an academic community, open expression is the most fundemental value. We ca n't have free speech just some of the time for some of the people,'' he told the rally. Security officers estimated the number of protesters at 1,000, but university spokesman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said no more than 400 attended the rally and the others were waiting to clear the tight security into the auditorium where <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> was speeking. The sell-out crowd of 2,000 paid $ 4 apiece to see <PERSON> Farrakan </PERSON>, who received $ 10,000 plus travel expenses from the two groups sponsoring the appearance: the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consciousness </ORGANIZATION> and the predominantly white <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>.

 There's not much you can buy for a penny these days. But with 1,000,131 of them, you can make your way into the Guinness Book of World Records. This weekend, a local group trying to raise money for a $ 40,000 playground will try to lay down at least that many coins in a high school gymnasium to set a world record in length for a line of pennies. Volunteers plan to begin creating 58 lanes 3 feet wide and 44 feet long on the gym floor Friday night. When they are finished sometime Saturday, they hope to have 1,540,500 pennies set down in rows an inch apart, creating a line 13.66 miles long. The Guinness-recognized record is 1,000,130 one-cent coins put down in a 12.29-mile line Nov. 15, 1985, by students at <ORGANIZATION> Blacktown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Girls </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. `` We figured out that, in order to accomplish the whole thing in a 12-hour period, we would have to lay down something like 30 pennies a second,'' volunteer coordinator <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. Coordinators have lined up 30 people for each two-hour shift of penny-laying. The group also has planned ahead how to get the pennies picked up after the record attempt. `` We'll start vacuuming them up on Sunday morning,'' said volunteer <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>. The group received donations for the effort from children, businesses and service groups. One problem, however, was that the three banks in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> only keep about $ 300 each in pennies at one time. The banks arranged for 800,000 pennies to be shipped in by armored car from <LOCATION> Davenport </LOCATION>, and paid $ 1,000 to have the pennies wrapped and shipped, which took about three weeks.

 Here in question and answer form is a discussion of the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> agreement: Q: Who is involved in the settlement? A: Signing the documents were the Soviet-supported Afghan government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, in which 3 million Afghan refugees live, with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> signing as guarantors. The mujahedeen gurrellias who have been fighting the Afghan government and the Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> have not signed and have vowed to carry on their struggle to establish an Islamic government. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which shelters about 2 million Afghan refugees, did not participate in the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks. Q: What is in the four-part accord? A: The text of the accord was being published only after the signing, but <ORGANIZATION> U.N </ORGANIZATION> mediator <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> and spokesman for the parties involved outlined the provisions. The documents include Afghan-Pakistani agreements for non-interference and non-intervention in each other's affairs and for the safe and voluntary return of Afghan refugees. Another part are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet declarations guaranteeing <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s future non-alignment and the rest of the settlement. A fourth document sets the timetable for the withdrawal of Soviet troops and ties the other three together. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said the pullout of an estimated 115,000 Soviet troops will begin May 15. The process is to be completed within nine months but <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has indicated it hopes to bring the last soldier home early. Q: How will compliance be monitored? A: An annex sets up a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> supervisory role for the settlement. About 50 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> officers in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> will monitor implementation until two months after all refugees return. The repatriation will be overseen by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> high commissioner for refugees. Q: Will the settlement stop the civil war? A: The mujahedeen alliance of Moslem guerrillas says it will continue fighting until Soviet troops leave and the Marxist <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government is overthrown. The <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government has said it will continue to exercise power. Both sides are well armed and believed capable of carrying on the fighting. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is convinced the bloodshed will not end, and the refugees will not return, until the creation of an interim Afghan government. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> says <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s political future is for its people to decide. Q: What about superpower support of the rivals? A: The accords say nothing about that. But the superpowers have reached an understanding allowing both to continue aid _ the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to the mujahedeen. Diplomats have said the understanding is that arms shipments will be phased out, with each superpower reserving the right to resume arms supplies if the other does so.

<HEAD>DEA Agents Will Carry More Firepower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal agents fighting <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s war against drugs got a hefty boost of firepower Wednesday with the announcement here that they will carry semi-automatic submachine guns. Each of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s 341 <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agents will be issued a 9mm Colt semi-automatic submachine gun that will fire three bursts every time an agent pulls the trigger, officials said. The increased firepower was welcome news for <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents who until now had to go into battle carrying six-shot, .38 - caliber handguns and shotguns against drug dealers firing 50 and 100 rounds a pop from fully automatic <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> and Mac-10 machine <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hook </PERSON> called it parity. `` It gives you a sense of confidence we never had in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> in the last 10 years with the .38 revolver. Anybody who levels a gun at a <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agent now is going to have some problems,'' said Hook. All 3,000 <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents will be issued submachine guns as quickly as possible, officials said, but <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> was chosen to be first because it is a mecca for drug dealers. From October to January, the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> seized 31 machine guns nationally. Of those, 11 were seized in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The Colt <ORGANIZATION> SMG </ORGANIZATION> weighs 5.75 pounds and is nearly 29 inches long. <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>'s version is modified to carry a clip of 32 rounds of 9mm ammunition. The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> is not using fully automatic guns because of concerns about the safety of bystanders, <PERSON> Hook </PERSON> said. Automatic guns tend to spray wildly and have muzzles that are difficult to control, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> is the first federal agency to routinely issue submachine guns. Customs and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> still carry .38 - and .357 - As of Wednesday, all <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents were also issued 15-shot 9mm automatic sidearms as their primary, personal weapons. The submachine gun is considered secondary firepower. The price of the guns was not disclosed. <PERSON> Hook </PERSON> said that was a government secret.

<HEAD>Government Authorizes Use of Contraception</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NIAMEY, Niger (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government authorized the use of contraceptives to help control population growth and the spread of disease. The move was regarded as significant in a predominantly Moslem country of 7 million people, where the use of contraceptives has been illegal without a doctor's prescription since independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1960.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities unsealed three indictments Wednesday involving two companies accused of selling radar navigational equipment to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in violation of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embargo. The companies named in the indictments are <ORGANIZATION> Marsh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Beechcraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vertrieb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Und </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> company of <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON> at a news conference. <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON>'s owner, <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Stilwell </PERSON>, 61, of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, was arrested Wednesday in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and arraigned on charges of exportation of defense articles, conspiracy to export items to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and making false statements to authorities, <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, 57, who owns <ORGANIZATION> Beechcraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vertrieb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Und </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, is charged with conspiracy to export equipment to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, exportation of defense articles, and making false statements to authorities, he said. The indictments were the result of an investigation prompted by a tip from <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ryan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> and aided by two West Germans who have pleaded guilty to related charges, he said. The charges against both companies and their owners stem from the alleged diversion of U.S.-made equipment from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which shops around the world for military equipment for its war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. An export embargo on U.S.-made equipment was first placed on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> by President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> during the height of the American hostage crisis. <PERSON> Stilwell </PERSON> allegedly submitted false export information to <PERSON> Teledyne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, in an attempt to conceal that the equipment's final destination was <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stilwell </PERSON>, who was arraigned in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> on Wednesday, is scheduled to be extradited to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> to appear in court Monday. The Sept. 25, 1987, indictment against <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> accuses him of directing his managing director, <PERSON> Bernd </PERSON> <PERSON> Pleuger </PERSON>, to continue negotiating and servicing Iranian contracts with the illegal diversion of equipment through their company. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>'s company sells service and distributes parts for <ORGANIZATION> Beechcraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, and other aircraft part manufacturers. <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON> said he doubted that <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> will be extradited to stand trial in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> because the offenses he faces do not warrant extradition under the West German extradition treaty. <PERSON> Pleuger </PERSON>, 51, of <LOCATION> Stuttgarde </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON>, 37, of <LOCATION> Augsberg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, have pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges in the case and have been cooperating in the investigation, <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Effort To Get Organs From Doomed Babies Continues Under New Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOMA LINDA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A hospital will continue to harvest organs for transplant from babies born with most of their brains missing, despite a prior announcement that the program had been suspended, officials said. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Loma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday he was mistaken when he announced earlier in the week that the hospital's program of keeping such babies alive had been temporarily halted until new guidelines could be issued. On Tuesday night, hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> issued a statement saying the program to admit anencephalic babies `` is to continue without interruption.'' The hospital's policy was slightly revised, however, so that such babies will be placed on respirators only if their heart rates slow or they have trouble breathing, <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> said from the hospital 60 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Anencephalic babies _ those missing most of their brains _ inevitably die within days to weeks. <PERSON> Loma </PERSON> <PERSON> Linda </PERSON>'s experimental and so-far unsuccesful program is aimed at using such infants as organ donors to save the lives of babies who otherwise would die of fatal heart defects or other deadly ailments. Previously, the hospital's policy was to place the anencephalic babies on respirators as soon as they were admitted to the hospital so their organs would n't deteriorate as they died. A seven-day limit for keeping them on the respirators was established to counter criticisms that the doomed anencephalic babies were suffering only to benefit infants who need transplants. The revised life-support policy, which still maintains the seven-day limit, apparently is aimed at increasing the proportion of babies who can be declared brain-dead. <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> said Wednesday his earlier statement `` was a misunderstanding on my part. I assumed that the program would n't be started until the statement -LRB- of revised policy -RRB- was released.'' Only one of the first six anencephalic babies admitted to <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linda </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovette </PERSON> <PERSON> Mount </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, remained alive Wednesday.

 A months-long recall effort to oust Mayor <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> failed Wednesday when an elections official announced that petitions submitted fell more than 2,000 names short of the number required by law. The backers of the drive delivered 21 bundles of petitions to the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday afternoon, beating a 5 p.m. deadline by several hours. They said they believed there were enough valid signatures to support calling a new mayoral election. But late Wednesday, <PERSON> Felicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Muftic </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said that even without checking for validity, the number of signatures was only 36,960. For a recall, the petitions would have to bear the valid signatures of 39,091 registered <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> voters, which is 25 percent of the number of votes cast in the last mayoral election, said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarkington </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` It appears that unofficially there's just not enough signatures to continue,'' <PERSON> Muftic </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pena </PERSON>, 41, one of the first Hispanics to be mayor of a major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> city, reacted immediately with pleasure. `` The time for negativism and doubt is behind us. To those people who opposed the recall I thank you. To those who supported the recall I urge you to join with the city to help move the city forward. These are critical times facing our city and we ca n't afford to have disunity,'' he said at a news conference at his office late Wednesday Recall organizer <PERSON> Marge </PERSON> <PERSON> Doty </PERSON> said earlier Wednesday that she had no exact count on the number of signatures, but said she was confident there were `` more than enough'' to continue the recall process. <PERSON> Doty </PERSON>, who launched the recall effort in January, requested a police escort to and from the <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> office after she reported receiving threats. The recall drive was started by a group angry over what its members claimed was fiscal mismanagement by the <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> administration. The group gathered support among residents stranded for several days by a major holiday snowstorm when maintenance crews plowed only major traffic arteries while <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> was vacationing out of state. While there is some dispute about precise procedures, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s charter calls for an entirely new, nonpartisan election if the petitions are validated to recall <PERSON> Pena </PERSON>, a second-term Democrat Any candidate who collected 300 names on a nominating petition could run, and if no candidate mustered a clear majority, a run-off would be held next. There have been hints of illegalities in the petition campaign. <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> appeared on a <ORGANIZATION> KOA </ORGANIZATION> radio call-in show Wednesday morning, and one caller informed him her daughter had been approached by petitioners. The daughter said she was told she `` had to sign,'' and when she said she was not a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> resident, she was allegedly told, `` We'll give you a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> address.''

 The hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet is the latest in a series of terrorist attacks in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that began when <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> convicted 17 pro-Iranian bombers in 1984. Since those men _ all but one of them Shiite Moslems _ were put behind bars, their comrades have hijacked airliners, kidnapped Americans and other foreigners and carried out bombing attacks and assassinations. The Shiites who hijacked <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> Flight 422 on April 5 have one demand: the release of the 17 men convicted of a series of bombings in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> in December 1983 that killed five people and wounded 61. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> refuses. The bombings were part of an Iranian-inspired campaign to destabilize <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, which has a substantial <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> minority, and which <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> accuses of helping <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in their 7 -LCB- - year-old war Dozens of other Shiites have been jailed in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> for bombings, but no one has demanded their release. `` There's a thread running through all these events that began with the 1983 bombings,'' <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Geldard </PERSON> of the London-based Institute for the Study of Terrorism said in a telephone interview. He and other specialists traced the chain of violence to one mastermind, <PERSON> Imad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mughniyeh </PERSON>, 36, a Lebanese Shiite who is a security chief of Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella organization whose name means Party of God. Among the 17, three have been sentenced to death. One of the three is <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Saab </PERSON>, whose real name is <PERSON> Mustapha </PERSON> <PERSON> Youssef </PERSON> <PERSON> Badreddin </PERSON>. He is <PERSON> Mughniyeh </PERSON>'s cousin and brother-in-law. `` At the end of the day, it's <PERSON> Mughniyeh </PERSON> who's been responsible for most of this violence,'' <PERSON> Geldard </PERSON> said. Some passengers freed by the hijackers of the Kuwaiti jet said a man boarded the plane last week when it landed at <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> in northeast <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> shortly after being seized. Palestinian negotiatiors in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, where the plane flew next, said the hijackers' leader, who they called `` experienced,'' never showed himself and they speculated that he might be <PERSON> Mughniyeh </PERSON>. The plane later flew to <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> where the hijackers refused to free their 32 remaining hostages. <PERSON> Mughniyeh </PERSON> disappeared in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, where he has his headquarters, several weeks ago after returning from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, informed souces said on condition of anonymity. Another leading Shiite militant in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musawi </PERSON>, leader of <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> which is linked to <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, also has been involved in the violence, <PERSON> Geldard </PERSON> said. One of <PERSON> Musawi </PERSON>'s cousins, <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Youssef </PERSON> <PERSON> Musawi </PERSON>, is among the 17 held in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and is serving a life sentence. `` The family connections involved here are the reason there's been such a passionate intensity involved in this campaign,'' <PERSON> Geldard </PERSON> said The 17 are members of the Iranian-based al-Dawaa, or The Call, a movement of dissident Iraqi Shiite fundamentalists opposed to the <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> government of President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>. <PERSON> Al-Dawaa </PERSON> is closely linked with <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> in 1980, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> publicly beheaded the movement's founder <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakr </PERSON> <LOCATION> al-Sadr </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> cleric and close friend of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s spiritual leader, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Lebanese intelligence officials said <PERSON> Mughniyeh </PERSON> and his clan were behind the kidnappings of Americans and Frenchmen in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> that began in 1984. Intelligence organizations consider <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, al-Dawaa and <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION>, or Islamic Holy War, one and the same, part of an increasingly potent terrorist network that leads to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. Here are some of the events that stemmed from the conviction of the 17 bombers. _ Dec 4, 1984: Five Arabs hijack a Kuwaiti airliner and demand the release of the 17. They fly the plane to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and kill two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> passengers. Iranian security men storm the plane after five days and capture the hijackers, who later vanish. Western intelligence believes the Iranians let them go. _ March 16, 1985: <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> is kidnapped in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION> Twenty-two foreigners, including nine Americans, are now held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. _ May 4, 1985: Islamic Jihad warns there will be `` catastrophic consequences'' if <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> does not free the 17 _ May 25, 1985: The emir of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>, narrowly escapes assasination when a Shiite suicide bomber rams a car loaded with explosives into his motorcade in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> Two of the emir's bodyguards and the bomber were killed.

 On spring nights, pearls of light from lanterns and campfires sparkle along <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s dark seawalls and breakwaters as thousands of people wait for tiny silvery fish to wander into their nets. The smelt are spawning again, a decades-old rite of spring that is part social event, part business and part recreation along the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> during the six-week season from April 1 to May 15. Smelting is almost a way of life. `` I've been doing it for 30 years, and I've run through friends, family, my kids _ nobody loves it quite as much as I do,'' said <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Telkamp </PERSON>, who staked out his spot four hours before he could legally lower his net at 7 p.m. `` My wife wo n't clean fish anymore, so I spend all night smelting and all day cleaning.'' Rainbow smelt, 6 - to 8-inch members of a family resembling the trout, have been eaten in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> for centuries In the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, the rite began after 1912, when the smelt, orginally a salt-water fish, escaped into the Great Lakes from a small lake in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> where they had been stocked. The best smelting at <LOCATION> Montrose </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> was on the breakwater, which was lined with Vietnamese, <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> and Korean families, and a few <LOCATION> Polish </LOCATION> immigrants. Fathers lower and raise the nets, children pull the fish from the mesh and mothers gut and clean. `` A lot of those fish are going to <LOCATION> Argyle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>,'' said one onlooker, referring to a nearby neighborhood with Vietnamese and <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> restaurants. With the right water temperature, current and wind, the smelt head in from open waters in great numbers. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> smelters run their square gill nets out on anchored ropes, raising the nets several times an hour. Nightly yields can reach 5,000 fish a person, but on nights when the fish are fewer, it's time for six-packs and smelt stories. Like the one <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Ohagan </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Darien </LOCATION>, tells about the tipsy smelter who weighted his net with his keys. `` A lot of guys fish without licenses and just abandon their nets when the wardens come by,'' <PERSON> Ohagan </PERSON> said. `` They figure it's cheaper to lose a $ 35 smelt rig than to pay a $ 50 fine `` This guy remembered that his keys were on the net, and he could n't get into his car, so he had to take the fine,'' <PERSON> Ohagan </PERSON> said. There's also the matter of upholding a tradition observed by younger smelters: biting the head off the first smelt of the season. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Flowers </PERSON>, 25, of <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Grange </PERSON>, pulled up his first net of the spring and saluted the four dangling fish with a beer, but he would n't take the bite. `` Now you wo n't have any more luck,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Falduto </PERSON>, 25, of Park Ridge. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON>, had set up a net, a fire and a tent for their two young daughters, <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>. `` We've been smelting about five years _ always at this very same spot,'' <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> said. `` We only ran out of last year's frozen smelt last month.'' The Roths, of Park Forest, like their smelt marinated in home-made hot sauce, but <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON>, also casting his net along the breakwater, cooks his in a beer batter. `` I keep a couple of gallons for myself and give the rest away _ to friends or in the tavern,'' <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> said. `` They're a lot easier to give away than zucchini or tomatoes.'' <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON>, 45, said this night he was catching a wedding present. `` My sister's getting married tomorrow in <ORGANIZATION> Eau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claire </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` She likes smelt, but they're hard to come by that far from the lakes.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: When a President's Words Are Not His Words</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Question: When are the president's words not the president's words? Answer: A lot of the time. Past and present <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides say former presidential spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> went too far when he quoted President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as saying things in meetings the president did n't say. It is nevertheless common practice for press secretaries and other aides to craft statements of various kinds which, usually after being approved by the president, are issued in his name. `` The whole business of communication is the drafting of materials that the president may use in one form or another, whether it's a speech or a statement or quotes on a various issue that tell what the president thinks,'' says <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` As long as it is approved by him and reflects his thinking and so forth, that is what it is,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday. `` It is the president's thinking.'' But, said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, it is wrong to attribute fabricated quotes to the president in the way <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> did it. Former presidential press secretaries made similar distinctions. `` You try to portray what the man is, what his thoughts are, and you try to put them in words that would be his kind of words, but you always have to rely on his approval of those speeches and those words; that's a given,'' said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> ter </PERSON> <PERSON> Horst </PERSON>, who was President <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>'s first press secretary. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziegler </PERSON>, who was President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s press secretary, said, `` It's common practice for press secretaries to develop quotes and get somebody's approval. That's been practice since the beginning of time.'' Both ter <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ziegler </PERSON>, however, said <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> was out of line. Why? What was he doing that was different? What he did, on one occasion, was to have an aide make up quotes, polish the quotes himself, and then pass them off as things the president said in his <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> summit meeting with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> defended the practice, saying, `` I think it was an accurate reflection of the president's thinking, the way I approached it. We talked many times in the preparation for the summit, so I knew how he felt.'' On another occasion, <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> says he put words that were spoken by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> into the president's mouth after a <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> jet was shot down in 1983 with 61 Americans aboard. Any president has much of his material written for him by aides who presumably help him to express his own view. There is a speech writing department to turn out speeches for him. He goes into meetings armed with talking points from which to speak. If he misspeaks at a news conference, a clarifying statement, prepared by aides, is issued in his name. When foreign journalists submit questions in writing, the answers are in his name but are staff-written. Even his answers at news conferences are frequently not spontaneous. According to <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> and others, the president is given briefing books in question-and-answer form for study and practice before each session. Reporters who cover the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, however, know and often report that such materials are written for the president. They did not know, and were not able to report, that the quotes given them by <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> were not actually spoken by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. In addition, as <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Reedy </PERSON>, former press secretary to <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> noted, at least some of the <LOCATION> Speakes-Reagan </LOCATION> quotes were fabricated in the context of a major international meeting. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>, White House reporter for the <ORGANIZATION> Sheridan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, when asked whether he was surprised to find that the quotes had been faked, replied, `` These quotes, yes. We're not talking about the president speaking to the Jaycees or the Future Farmers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. We're talking about a meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> insists that he was never aware his spokesman concocted quotes for him and says he is getting tired of `` kiss-and-tell books'' written by his former aides. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, answering questions at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION>, also said <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s policies have not been scrutinized adequately in the Democratic presidential race because it might be `` misinterpreted into some kind of racial attack.'' In a wide-ranging question-and-answer session on Wednesday, the president commented for the first time on two issues _ the sensitive topic of race in the 1988 presidential race and the controversy over the new book by his former spokesman, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>. <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>, in his book `` Speaking Out,'' reveals that he twice gave quotes to the press corps claiming the words were <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s when in fact they were not One incident occurred after the downing of a <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> jet in 1983, and the other came during the 1985 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> summit between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. When the story surfaced earlier this week, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> aides described the president as angry to learn of the deception. <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>, however, said in subsequent interviews that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> knew at the time of the practice and did not object. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` I was not aware of that and just learned it recently, as all the rest of you did, and I can tell you right now that I have no affection for these kiss-and-tell books that are being written, and I find it entirely fiction.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not directly answer the question of whether he approved of the practice or would allow it to continue. His current spokesman, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, has condemned the practice. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s reference to `` kiss-and-tell'' books evidently refers not only to <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>' book, but to `` Behind the Scenes,'' written by his former deputy chief of staff, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>, and a forthcoming volume by former chief of staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>. The president also was asked about <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>' contention that he `` does not read many newspapers thoroughly.'' `` Well, I begin with the comics,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, confirming part of <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>' account and drawing a laugh from his audience in the process. The president said that was `` a lifetime habit,'' and that he then turns to the editorial pages. He said he also looks through news clippings prepared by his staff because of the volume of papers published outside of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` But he's wrong when he implies that I do n't read the papers. Yes, I do,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Later, discussing the presidential campaign and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said: `` I hope that race will not be a part of this campaign in any way.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> went on to say of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, `` It seems that more attention is being paid to the difference in color than is being paid to what he is actually saying. `` And I have to believe that a great many of us would find ourselves in great disagreement with the policies that he is proposing and would perhaps be more vocal about them if it was n't concern that that'd be misinterpreted into some kind of a racial attack,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has advocated deep cuts in <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending and an array of costly social programs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> acknowledged the Republican field is down to one candidate, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, but he did not give <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> his endorsement, saying there still is a convention to be held. The president also refused to predict the outcome of the Democratic contest. On other topics: _ He said he expects Afghan rebels to continue fighting the Marxist regime in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> despite an agreement being signed Thursday for the withdrawal of 115,000 Soviet forces after an eight-year occupation <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said nothing in the agreement prevents the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from supplying the rebels `` as long as they need it and as long as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> continues to supply the Afghan forces in their puppet government.'' _ <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banking system `` has some troubles. But he also said, `` I do n't think it is a problem that could suddenly bring disaster down upon us.''

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> says he is confident the Soviets will keep their promise to withdraw from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> under an agreement hailed as the first step toward ending the bitter Afghan struggle. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> today to join Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> at the ceremonial signing of a series of settlement accords. Among them is a Soviet pledge to withdraw an estimated 115,000 Red Army troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> also plan to issue statements reaffirming their nations' right to continue aiding the Afghan factions _ assuring that the war will go on as a civil conflict. There was fresh evidence of continued warfare on the eve of the signing. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed reports from Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> earlier in the week that Soviet forces near <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> were sent to relieve <LOCATION> Gardez </LOCATION>, a beleaguered <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> garrison south of the capital, amid fierce fighting with U.S.-backed guerrillas. The units were said to consist of an undetermined number of soldiers and 420 vehicles, including T-72 tanks, armored personnel carriers and mobile rocket launchers. <LOCATION> Gardez </LOCATION> is 80 miles south of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and 60 miles from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, staging area for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the resistance. <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas recently cut the road to <LOCATION> Gardez </LOCATION>, where a Soviet special forces regiment is garrisoned, said one source. Another source said convoys of trucks also were sent into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the past week, but it was not clear if the trucks were filled with troops or were empty. Before leaving for <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told members of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> foreign affairs committees that he had faith in the Soviet promise, committee members said. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, one of Capitol Hill's ardent champions of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for anti-Soviet guerrillas in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, said after meeting <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> he accepted the assurances. `` The bottom line is that the Soviets are getting out,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. Under the withdrawal agreement, the Soviets are supposed to pull out 50 percent of their troops within 90 days, and the entire contingent by Feb. 15, 1989. That would mark the end of a Soviet troop presence in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> that began with a December 1979 airlift of <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> forces into <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to back pro-Moscow Afghan leaders in their war against insurgents. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> analysts believe the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> will pull back from exposed positions and concentrate in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and around the northern city of <LOCATION> Mazar-i-Sharif </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had hoped to reach agreement with the Soviets to cut aid to both sides _ the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> backed guerrillas and the Soviet-sponsored Afghan government _ but <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> rebuffed an aid cutoff and now both sides will continue arming their clients. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he hoped <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> mediator <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>, who arranged the Soviet pullout, will be successful in arranging a peace accord between the Afghans. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the Afghan government have agreed under the accords to stop interfering in each others' affairs and the superpowers are signing the pact as `` guarantors.'' Despite the likelihood of continued fighting, the prospect of a Soviet withdrawal has been hailed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials as a potential milestone in superpower relations. Since 1979, the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administrations have told the Soviets that their continued presence in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> has made it difficult for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to trust Soviet professions of peaceful intent.

 At the immigration service, Assistant Commissioner <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said it was his job to recommend to Commissioner <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> whether to stay in the Chester Arthur Building or move. If <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a close friend of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s from the days when they worked together in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, had demanded a move, the <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> would have found a new building, according to <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> officials. But <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> recommended staying even though he was displeased with the building management, particularly its maintenance of the air system. `` At one point, a downtown, new building came on the market and people thought about that for a while,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` But when you look at the logistics of uprooting your entire headquarters staff for a month, it's not worth it.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said other events tied his hands: The first immigration reform bill in a generation was enacted Oct. 17, 1986. `` We could n't even consider a move at that time, because of the demands of the new act,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` We had to get thousands of new employees on board.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said when he discussed the lease with <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> `` there were no options. When you look at the cost of moving and all that, it's kind of the decision that does n't have to be made.'' But during this period, the immigration service outgrew <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>; some employees were put in two other buildings, five and 10 blocks away. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> says no one pressured him, and that he never heard whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had an opinion on the lease or about <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s salary being paid indirectly by the building owners Sources familiar with <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s investigation have said he is interested in the role played by <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s confidant and former attorney, <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, in obtaining the Benders' job offers to <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> has been indicted for allegedly trying to peddle his influence with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> in other matters. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s attorney, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> played a peripheral role in <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s taking the MS job instead of the radio program. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> did not return numerous telephone calls over a week. Meanwhile, the man who sold <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> to the <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> partnership still wonders why they bought it and gave him such a good deal. `` We are still laughing because we did a very good deal there,'' said <PERSON> Dirk </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Westreenen </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Property </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>. The sale price more than tripled his $ 12 million investment five years earlier. He decided to sell because `` the <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> gave us notice that they wanted to get rid of a floor and a half. That was the risk: Are they going to stay? Who is going to take this space, because it is not first-class space and it is not a first-class location?'' Of <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Westreenen </PERSON> said, `` I do n't know how much of a gamble it was, but he took the gamble that we did n't want to take.''

 A real estate developer whose family pays for the salary of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON>, was granted a $ 50 million lease renewal on a building the government said risked the health and safety of <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> workers. Thirteen days after obtaining the new lease, the developer and his partners sold the building for $ 22.6 million more than they had paid for it two years earlier _ a 60 percent profit, according to <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> land records. The developer, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>, was the principal owner of the building in late 1985 when the <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> <PERSON> Foundation </PERSON>, his family's tax-exempt philanthropy, donated $ 120,000 to the <ORGANIZATION> Multiple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sclerosis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> to hire <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> at $ 40,000-a-year for three years, the society's lawyer said The lease _ a renewal at more than three times the previous rent _ was signed even though the landlord had not cleaned up an air system environmental inspectors said was a health hazard that could explain above-average sickness there, according to government documents. And the lease was signed even though the easy public access required by another tenant `` jeopardizes -LRB- Justice's -RRB- ability to provide adequate security ... and increass the opportunity for sabotage and other covert activities,'' a government document said. An attorney for the Meeses denies any wrongdoing on their part in the transactions, but acknowledges that the Benders and <PERSON> Meeses </PERSON> know each other. The Benders refuse to discuss the matter. A key government official said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> played no role in the real estate decision. But the MS society's records on Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s job have been subpoenaed by independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> as part of his investigation into whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> committed federal crimes, according to <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bierbower </PERSON>, attorney for the MS Society. Federal law makes it a felony for a federal official to take any governmental action that would affect the financial status of his spouse. Further, a presidential order forbids federal officials from conduct that might give the appearance of a conflict of interest, even where one does not exist. The seven-story <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Building </PERSON> on the rundown fringe of downtown <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> houses the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. In March 1985, <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Bender </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, and other investors acquired the building at an apparently inauspicious moment in its history. Public records show that <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> and his associates paid $ 37.5 million _ nearly twice the assessed value _ for the building. At the time, the building's most valuable asset was the federal lease, which was due to expire within a year and would be put up for bids by other landlords. In fact, the federal government had already taken steps to move out. On Aug. 8, 1984, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had approved a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration plan, pushed by then-Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, to begin moving some federal offices out of the building. The plan called for a new lease there in 1986 for only 63 percent of the space the government had before. However, three months after the <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> partnership bought the building, the administration told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that its plans had changed dramatically. In June 1985, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> _ the government's housekeeping agency _ notified <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> it wanted to keep the immigration service in the full 264,000 square feet at <LOCATION> Chester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arthur </LOCATION>. That same month, immigration officials complained of illnesses among <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> employees apparently caused by the building's air system. On Sept. 26, 1985, assistant immigration commissioner <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> formally requested an environmental inspection from the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Against this background, in the fall of 1985, the Benders made two separate efforts to get Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> on a payroll. First, they tried to interest Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> in a public affairs job at their radio station, WWDC, which has a rock-and-roll format, but Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> declined, MS attorney <PERSON> Bierbower </PERSON> said. Then, in October 1985, the <ORGANIZATION> Bender </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> indicated it would contribute $ 120,000 to the MS society for a development director, <PERSON> Bierbower </PERSON> said. `` There was no question that MS had in mind that <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON> would become the development director'' at the time the <ORGANIZATION> Bender </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> put up the money for the position, <PERSON> Bierbower </PERSON> said. `` We were after <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>.'' She had previously worked there as a volunteer. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Sondra </PERSON>, is president of the family foundation and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> MS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> board. Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, 56, a former probation officer in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, has done mostly volunteer work since coming to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with her husband in 1981. She also has worked as the paid executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a foundation to study the future. Meanwhile, the <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> lease negotiations dragged on during 1986. Finally, on May 14, 1987, after the <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> partnership promised to clean up the air system, the government signed a new lease for 259,000 square feet. The 10-year lease was worth $ 50 million. On May 27, the <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> partnership sold the building for $ 60.1 million cash, public records show. One of the new owners, asking not to be identified by name, said the new lease `` was clearly one of the most desirable things from our standpoint.'' <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> family members referred all questions to attorney <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Glanzer </PERSON>, who said, `` I'm not going to answer your questions. I have no comment.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON>, an attorney for the Meeses, denied the attorney general played any role in the decision to renew the lease. `` He was aware that the lease was up and so on, but that's it. He had no involvement in the lease matter in any substantive way. There is no indication that the Meeses had anything to do with his -LRB- <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>'s -RRB- making $ 22 million.''

 A student judicial board at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wednesday </ORGANIZATION> declared invalid an election in which an avowed communist and another student were chosen as co-presidents of the student body. The board said the constitution of the Student Government Association prohibited more than one person from holding the presidency. `` Only one person can run for and hold the office of <ORGANIZATION> SGA </ORGANIZATION> president,'' the three-member student court said in an opinion issued late Wednesday night. The student court, whose decisions are binding on the student government, ordered a new election. A date was not immediately set. Student attorney general <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> asked the court to declare the <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabinowitz-Shari </PERSON> <PERSON> Silkoff </PERSON> ticket invalid because of the joint candidacy. <PERSON> Rabinowitz </PERSON>, a 20-year-old member of the <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, is believed to be the first such member elected campus president since the group was formed five years ago. He and <PERSON> Silkoff </PERSON>, also 20 and a self-described progressive, were elected March 15 with 1,454 votes, 391 more than conservative candidate <PERSON> Aram </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamparian </PERSON> at the 19,000-student campus. `` This was a travesty of justice,'' <PERSON> Rabinowitz </PERSON> said after the decision was announced. `` We're going to beat this. We want to fight for the rights of the students.'' A professor who testified at the hearing last week on behalf of <PERSON> Rabinowitz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Silkoff </PERSON> said the constitution's language about the presidency was vague. `` It could be read in different ways,'' said political science professor <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfange </PERSON> said. On whether it prohibited co-presidents, he said: `` That language does not necessarily mean that to me, as a layman reading this document.'' Conservatives in the student senate had filibustered last week to keep the election from being ratified and to stop <PERSON> Rabinowitz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Silkoff </PERSON> from taking office.

 Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> thinks it's time to remember what he calls `` a forgotten piece of history.'' `` Well, at least it's forgotten down here, but certainly not back home,'' says the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Republican. `` A lot of people down here in the lower 48 think we're overseas, we're some kind of foreign country.'' The history to which <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> referred is the little-known role played by <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> in World War II, when the <LOCATION> Aleutian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> were invaded and occupied by Japanese troops for 14 months until the summer of 1943. It was the first time since the War of 1812 that a foreign nation had occupied <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> territory. The story is eloquently told in `` <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> at War,'' which will air April 25 on the Public Broadcasting System. The one-hour film, written and produced by <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldin </PERSON> for the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, was previewed Wednesday in a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing room at a reception hosted by <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> legislators. In 1942, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> was a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territory, still 17 years away from statehood. It was largely undeveloped, a frontier land where conditions were primitive and life was hard. There were few paved roads and little development. <PERSON> Goldin </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> native who has lived in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> since 1970, spent two years making the film, spending much of that time digging up rare historical footage. Among the film he used was rare color footage taken by the late director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Huston </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> came under attack on June 3, 1942, when Japanese planes bombed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> base at <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> in the Aleutians chain. Although damage was relatively light, 25 Americans were killed. The attack was part of the overall Japanese drive on <LOCATION> Midway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, the small but vital American outpost in the middle of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. The Aleutian attack was intended as a feint, a move designed to draw away from Midway some of the already thin American forces which were still reeling from the attack on <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> six months before. But unknown to the Japanese, American intelligence had broken Japanese codes and did n't fall for the <LOCATION> Aleutian </LOCATION> gambit. Instead, Adm. <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimitz </PERSON> concentrated his forces at Midway and dealt the Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> a crushing attack in one of history's greatest sea battles. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> never recovered. While the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> was reeling at Midway, Japanese army troops were landing in June 1942 on two Aleutian islands at the western end of the far-flung chain. About 2,600 troops landed on <LOCATION> Attu </LOCATION> and another 5,600 at <LOCATION> Kiska </LOCATION>, 200 miles away. For the next year, as <PERSON> Goldin </PERSON>'s film makes clear, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> bombers steadily pounded the two Japanese installations, but were unable to dislodge the invaders. One tragic footnote was the forced removal of about 900 Aleut Indians to a new home 2,000 miles away. But conditions at the new location were harsh and preparations were few; many of the Aleuts died. `` Many people do n't realize what was done to the Aleuts. It's time their story was told,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said In the spring of 1943, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces prepared to retake the two Aleutian islands and the decision was made to attack the smaller base at <LOCATION> Attu </LOCATION>. On May 11, 1943, 11,000 American troops invaded <LOCATION> Attu </LOCATION> under dreadful weather conditions. What was supposed to be a three-day job took three weeks of often-brutal fighting through the rocky hills and valleys of the desolate island. When the Japanese on <LOCATION> Attu </LOCATION> realized they were surrounded, the hundreds of soldiers remaining alive committed suicide, a fact well documented by the film. Only 29 of the 2,600 Japanese troops survived; <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> casualties totaled 549. Two months later, under cover of fog, the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> was able to evacuate its base on <LOCATION> Kiska </LOCATION>. Even now, <LOCATION> Attu </LOCATION> remains a little-visited place, and for good reason, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> noted. `` There are still a lot of Japanese relics out there,'' he said. `` We believe there are some unexploded shells on the island, so people are kept away. We considered making it a historic site, but it would cost a fortune to sanitize it and so the job has never been done.''

<HEAD>USDA Says Farm Economy `Has Turned the Corner'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analysis says the recovery in farmland prices is putting a healthy glow back into the financial complexion of American farmers. When new figures based on readings as of Feb. 1 are released, they are expected to show the average price of farmland is up nationally for the first time in six years, although there are still areas where land values are lagging. Meanwhile, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says that as stability returned last year to farm real estate _ which includes land and buildings _ the financial returns to farmers as a share of equity `` became positive'' for the first time since 1980. Equity, the value difference between assets and debts, plummeted 34 percent to $ 536.6 billion in 1986 from $ 814.4 billion in 1981. Land values, the mainstay of farm assets, plunged $ 256 billion between 1981 and 1986, especially in the <LOCATION> Corn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> states. `` As land values declined, more and more borrowers were unable to pay existing obligations without restructuring their debts or selling their assets,'' the report said. `` Even some farms with positive cash flows were considered poor credit risks because of low or negative equity positions.'' The report added: `` An improved land market in the remainder of the 1980s represents an important indicator that the agricultural economy has turned the corner.'' One measure of the importance of the land market to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agriculture is the agency's computations on the total return to equity from farm income and real capital gains. In 1987, when net cash income rose to a record level of $ 57 billion by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> estimates, a couple of other things happened. Interest rates declined, and farm debt, which climbed to a peak of $ 192.7 billion in 1983, began to recede as credit tightened and farmers began paying off at a faster clip. More than $ 50 billion was paid off in the next few years, and agency economists think the 1988 debt balance may be whittled further to a range of $ 128 billion to $ 138 billion. `` Real estate debt of $ 75 billion to $ 81 billion in 1988 will be 25 percent lower than in 1984,'' the report said. `` Non-real estate debt of $ 53 billion to $ 57 billion will be nearly 37 percent less.'' Thus, according to the economists, the return to farmers on their equity in 1987 averaged 4.4 percent nationally, nearly the average of 4.9 percent a year in the period of 1959-70. Net cash income is expected to decline this year to a range of $ 50 billion to $ 55 billion because of reduced federal supports, as a three-year drop in production expenses comes to an end, and because livestock earnings are likely to decline after two years of growth. As a consequence, farm returns on equity are forecast to decline, perhaps ranging from no gain at all or an increase of 2 percent. But that `` reflects the estimated stable prices for land,'' the report said.

 Exporters have sold <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> an additional 350,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat at subsidized prices for delivery this year. In a related development Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> also is eligible for subsidized wheat.

A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> bought more than 4.9 million tons of wheat under previous EEP arrangements, which allow exporters to sell commodities at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition and then collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said the bonuses due the four companies averaged $ 28.28 per ton, or about 77 cents per bushel of wheat. The bonuses will be paid in the form of surplus commodities owned by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has more than 1.9 million tons remaining for use under the <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> initiative announced April 5, he Acting Undersecretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> will be allowed to buy wheat under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> arrangements.

<HEAD>Economic Prospects Improving in US But not in Poor Countries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Economic prospects have improved slightly over the past six months in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other industrial countries, but have dropped sharply in poor countries, according to estimates made public today by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the fund predicts that production will increase this year by the same 2.9 percent as it did in 1986 and 1987, with a slower increase of 2.7 percent in 1989. It predicts declining unemployment from 6.2 percent last year to 6 percent this year and 5.9 next year. Inflation in the industrialized countries is pegged at 3 percent in 1988. But in the Third World, the report says, prices paid by consumers will go up by 46.7 percent. Total growth in the Third World is put at 3.7 percent. The report does not include population figures, but since Third World birth rates are high, the rise in income for each individual may be only about half as much. For industrial countries, the new growth figure is 3 percent. `` An important positive development in 1987 was the strengthening of policy coordination among the major industrial countries,'' says the fund's new `` World Economic Outlook.'' `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> federal budget deficit fell substantially, as did deficits in other large countries with troublesome fiscal positions.'' In the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>'s parlance, a country gets into a `` troublesome fiscal position'' when its government fails to collect enough taxes to cover its expenses. The fund says the three most economically important Latin American countries _ <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> _ have had serious setbacks in curbing inflation and there are signs of rising prices elsewhere. Fund officials doubt if their governments can do anything effective to stabilize their economies. Sluggish growth in the Third World is blamed in part on a slowdown in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> due to drought, and to lower pay and less investment in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> because of rising inflation. Growth in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, on the other hand, was called `` particularly buoyant.'' The predictions are made on the assumption that government policies and currency exchange rates will not change. For the major industrial countries taken as a group the predictions include these for the years 1990 to 1992: a 2.8 percent increase in production and a slight increase in the jobless rate to 6.9 percent.

<TEXT>
 The assertion by Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reserves the right to `` use nuclear force'' in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is a restatement of a longstanding but sometimes confusing policy of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. In the arcane parlance of nuclear weapons, there is a distinct difference between the phrases `` first strike'' and `` first use.'' As used by nuclear strategists, the term `` first strike'' refers to a pre-emptive nuclear attack by one superpower against the other. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have repeatedly said no such strike will be undertaken by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The phrase `` first use'' generally refers to the use of atomic weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, an option the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has long kept open. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy is that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies might have to resort to nuclear weapons to stop a Soviet attack with conventional weapons. Supporters of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> have argued that the possibility of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear strike is the main threat feared by the Soviets. The American threat arises from the Soviets' large numerical advantage in a variety of conventional weapons such as tanks and artillery. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was attacked on Tuesday by Democratic presidential rival <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> for his reference to the possible use of nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not tip its hand on the use of nuclear force. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> responded that he was merely restating longstanding policy, and the record largely bears that out. Retired Army Gen. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, the former commander of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, repeatedly told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that because of the Soviets' advantage in conventional weapons, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> might have to resort to the first use of nuclear weapons within `` a matter of days'' to halt a large-scale Soviet attack. The policy has received new attention in the debate over the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, the U.S.-Soviet pack eliminating medium-range atomic weapons. Critics of the INF pact, such as conservative Republicans, have argued that eliminating the nuclear threat posed by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Pershing II and ground-launched cruise missiles was one of the main reasons the Soviets agreed to the pact. Even supporters of the treaty have argued that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> needs to upgrade its conventional forces to keep the peace in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. While American doctrine for strategic, or long-range, atomic weapons is based on a `` no first strike'' plan, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have been intentionally vague about spelling out just what would cause the launching of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> strategic arsenal. For example, American strategic doctrine is generally thought to be based on the philosophy that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be able to ride out a Soviet first strike and then deal a devastating counterattack. That doctrine of absorbing the first strike arises from the desire to avoid a nuclear war caused by computer error, no matter how small that likelihood.

March 1, 1985: <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> real estate developer, heads a partnership which completes purchase of the Chester Arthur Building for $ 37.5 million, nearly twice the assessed value and three times its purchase price about five years earlier. June 6, 1985: The administration notifies <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> intends to stay in the Chester Arthur Building, instead of moving out some employees. June 1985: Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the major tenant in the building, forward complaints to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> _ the government's housekeeper _ that the building's air system is causing illness among workers. Fall 1985: Officials at <ORGANIZATION> WWDC </ORGANIZATION>, a rock-and-roll radio station owned by the <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> family, offer Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON>, a position as a public affairs commentator She declines the offer. Sept. 26, 1985: Assistant immigration commissioner <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> formally requests an environmental inspection of the air system at <LOCATION> Chester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arthur </LOCATION>. October 1985: The <ORGANIZATION> Bender </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a family-owned philanthropy, makes known that it is willing to donate money to pay <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> as a development director of the <ORGANIZATION> Multiple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sclerosis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, where she has been a volunteer. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Sondra </PERSON>, is president of the foundation and serves on the MS society board. Jan. 1, 1986: Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> begins a $ 40,000-a-year job, under the <ORGANIZATION> Bender </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>'s three-year grant. July 2, 1986: Environmental inspectors report `` many offices in the Chester Arthur Building which exhibited high complaint rates and above-average sick leave occurences contained viable aero-allergens in concentrations which could easily produce these effects.'' May 14, 1987: The <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> signs a $ 50 million, 10-year lease for <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> workers to stay in the Chester Arthur Building after the <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> partnership promises to clean the air system.

 Lady <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> breezed into a <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> townhouse and realized her black patent leather pumps were still in the car. `` You want to see what old ladies wear?'' the wife of former President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> asked in her Southern drawl Wednesday as a coterie of journalists, gossip columnists and society mavens gathered around. The 75-year-old Texan, who once worried about being shy and insecure as first lady, pulled her coat aside to reveal a pair of sturdy walking shoes. Later, armed with a new coat of lipstick and the proper shoes, <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> was ready to talk to the women who had covered her years in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and who had recounted in dispatches for their newspapers what she wore and where she had been. Wednesday's story, however, was of her love affair with the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> bluebonnet and the Indian paintbrush, the pink evening primrose and the Mexican hat. Nature, she said, `` has been my sustenance, pleasure, my joy.'' She told of coming back from overseas trips when her husband was president, inspired to cloak <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in daffodils, tulips and azaleas. She spoke of returning to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> after he left office and turning a weed and debris-choked riverfront in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> into a riverwalk where blooming trees now make the perfect backdrop for wedding portraits and family pictures. And she talked of helping nurture the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildflower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` I pushed and shoved, encouraged and aided and did everything I could,'' she said of the center in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, where she spends time away from the <ORGANIZATION> LBJ </ORGANIZATION> ranch in <LOCATION> Stonewall </LOCATION>. `` A lot of you might think this is a lightweight proposition in a world of heavyweight questions, but we're going to live, I feel, and I just think it gives joy to live in a more beautiful world.'' The nation is now thanking Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> for her efforts to beautify the countryside from <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hole </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and to paint it in native flowers. In what is being called `` A Jubilee Celebration'' marking the year of her 75th birthday, Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> will be given a <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medal </ORGANIZATION> at a White House ceremony, and honored with receptions, a concert and black-tie dinner April 28-30 in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> McSweeny </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> who with her husband came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to work in the <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> administration in the 1960s, said the celebration is timed to coincide with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> at its most beautiful _ the time of year when cherry blossoms float in the air like clouds, and tulips and daffodils decorate traffic circles and public places. `` It best reflects all her contributions to the city,'' Mrs. <PERSON> McSweeny </PERSON> said at Wednesday's coffee to promote the jubilee activities. `` It's the time of year that shows it off the most.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> took advantage of her position at center stage to promote the center and a book she co-wrote with horticulturalist <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lees </PERSON>. `` Wildflowers Across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' will be published in May by <ORGANIZATION> Abbeville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and part of the proceeds will go to the wildflower center. Created in December 1982 with a donation from Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of 60 acres east of <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> and $ 125,000, the center is devoted to researching wildflowers and educating about their use. It serves as an information clearinghouse and is experimenting with wildflowers and native plants to determine how to incorporate them into landscapes. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> says it's a lightweight proposition,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, vice president of communications for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trucking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, who is coordinating publicity on the jubilee celebration. `` Thank God someone in this troubled world is thinking about beauty.''

<HEAD>Last Minute Filers Can Save Time With Short Form</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If you are among millions of taxpayers waiting until the last minute to file federal returns, you might save time and expedite any refund by avoiding the long Form 1040. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, an arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, found during a check of one of the 10 <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> processing centers that 14.1 percent of filers had used 1040 when they could have filed the simpler 1040A or the one-page 1040EZ. Many of those probably were taxpayers who in the past itemized deductions and thus had to file the long form, and stuck with it this year even though repeal or reduction of several deductions made it no longer profitable to itemize. The shorter forms are less complicated to fill out and present fewer opportunities for errors. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> requires less time to process them. But the shorter forms are not for everyone. If your itemized deductions total more than your standard deduction, you'll save money by itemizing, which requires the long form. And you must file the long form if taxable income is $ 50,000 or more. Midnight Friday is the deadline for most individuals to file their returns _ the first that reflect the far-reaching tax-law revision enacted in 1986. So far, despite confusion about the law and new forms, taxpayers and the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> seem to be holding their own. `` This has been a very good filing season to date,'' <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> said. `` But it has been challenging ... because of the number of changes made in the 1986 act.'' Through April 8, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> had received 64.5 million returns, compared with 65.7 million before the last week of the 1987 filing season. The agency has processed 52.7 million this year, down slightly from 52.8 million at this time last year. Refunds have been certified for 78 percent _ 41 million _ of the returns that have been processed, compared with 79 percent at this time last year. Refunds are averaging $ 830, up from $ 815. New restrictions on itemized deductions and higher standard deductions have significantly reduced the number of couples and individuals who are itemizing, <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> said. The one dark spot on this tax season, <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> agree, is that taxpayers still find it difficult to get the correct answer when they telephone tax questions to the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> provided the right answer to only 62 percent of the 1,523 test calls made by <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>. A broader <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> survey, 15,000 calls, produced the correct response to 72.1 percent of the questions. In each survey, the accuracy rate was up slightly from a February check. `` You get better odds in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>,'' grumbled Rep. <PERSON> J.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> oversight subcommittee. `` We must and will improve our accuracy rate for our customers,'' <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> promised. He mentioned plans to make telephone `` assistors'' full-time, rather than seasonal, employees; to raise their pay and to give each immediate access to computerized information necessary to answer questions. Despite all the confusion about new laws and complicated forms, the subcommittee was told, taxpayers are having fewer problems than anticipated: _ The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> has received 15.7 million telephone calls for information this year, up 12.6 percent from last year but 7.8 percent fewer than expected _ Errors are showing up on 20.7 percent of returns, about 1.4 percentage points above last year `` The amount of the increase has been less than expected,'' said <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> Deputy Director <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Finch </PERSON>. _ About 42 percent of the returns filed so far have been prepared by professionals, up from 40 percent last year but less than in 1986 Some experts had predicted most taxpayers would have to turn to professionals because of the new law. <PERSON> Finch </PERSON> said 48 percent of 892 taxpayers surveyed in four states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> had more trouble filling out this year's returns than last year's. Another 30 percent found little difference, and 12 percent said this year's were easier. Ten percent were not sure.

 Consumer advocate <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> wants <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to reject efforts to restructure the nation's financial system to allow banks and securities firms broad latitude to affiliate for the first time since 1933. <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, representing the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> telecommunications and finance subcommittee Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should not repeal the provisions of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act which prohibit banks and bank holding companies from underwriting and dealing in corporate securities.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hollywood will add its touch to the ready-made theater of the Democratic National Convention this summer, but producers say the professional flourishes will be tasteful and relevant. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hired the entertainment production company of Smith-Hemion to produce and stage the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> convention _ believed to be the first time the Democrats have brought in theatrical producers to stage their convention. Smith-Hemion has a history of staging `` events'' and has earned 20 Emmy awards over the years for its television extravaganzas, said partner <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. Festivities like the Liberty Weekend celebration in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, television's `` We the People 200'' featuring <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> Disneyland </ORGANIZATION>'s 25th anniversary party were produced by the company. Smith-Hemion will work with the media, create `` the look'' of the arena, design the podium, oversee the sound and use big screens to provide visual elements that have been pre-taped in support of the speeches, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> explained. `` Even in a convention there is room for relevant entertainment _ tasteful and relevant,'' he said, adding that in his opinion a convention should be more than a series of speeches. The agenda of the convention is up to the Democrats, he emphasized, but the producers will supply `` things that are emotionally effective or emotionally motivated and good information that is visually enhanced.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said it was too early to identify entertainers or special effects to be used during the convention. Those things will be part of the it, he said, `` but the Democrats have not gone into show business. The most important priority is the need to maintain their agenda.'' <PERSON> Smith-Hemion </PERSON>'s team of about 100 people started working six weeks ago and will continue working until the convention is staged July 18-21 in The Omni. `` This is a news event that TVs are picking up. Opening ceremony on Liberty Weekend was a bit created. This convention is an official American event. We would do it whether it was on television or not,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. He said the convention is more meaningful to him because `` if I have ever been affiliated with any party, it would be Democratic. But I have always voted for the person, not the party.'' In addition to the staging and production work, Smith-Hemion will provide closed circuit, gavel-to-gavel coverage that will be available by satellite to every television station in the country, he said. The art director for the convention is <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagler </PERSON>, who worked on both Liberty Weekend and the 1984 Olympics in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` He is designing the look of the podium and how the arena will look from a scenic standpoint,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. How will Smith-Hemion rate the success of its work? `` I do n't think ratings will enter into it whatsoever,'' he said of the television ratings which usually tell networks whether they have scored a commercial success. Emmy nominations and awards are a measure of creative success, but that wo n't be a good gauge in this case either, he said. It will come down to whether `` the <ORGANIZATION> DNC </ORGANIZATION> says we did a good job,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who refused to identify a favorite candidate. If the Democratic nominee wins the presidential race in November, `` that would make us feel pretty good. Obviously that is the ultimate goal _ to win the election come November,'' he said.

 The hijacking of a Kuwaiti jet by Shiite Moslems and the killing of two <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> hostages have embarrassed <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders who want world attention to remain focused on the Arab uprising in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Ahmed </PERSON>, foreign minister of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, asked by reporters about the hijackers, said `` regrettably we have to concede they are Arabs.'' The 4-month-old Palestinian uprising in Israeli-occupied territory has brought an unusual degree of unity among Arabs, radical and moderate, supporting Arabs youths defying Israeli armed forces with stones and bottles. Pictures of the two Kuwaiti bodies thrown out of the jumbo jet in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> on Saturday and Monday and wired to newspapers and television stations around the world, shook that unity. `` This incident has spoiled the image of the Arabs in the world,'' said President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said Israeli attempts to put down the uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where more than 140 Palestinians have been killed since Dec. 8, were `` our prime preoccupation.'' <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, issued a message to the hijackers of the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 that `` their action is not only hurting the Kuwaitis but the Arab and Islamic nation.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said the hijacking _ which has taken the plane and hostages from <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, in nine days _ took away the glare of world publicity from the Palestinian revolt. `` This action diverts world attention from the uprising in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, and from the brutal and oppressive measures of the Israeli occupying authorities,'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Taher </PERSON> <PERSON> Masri </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> on Wednesday. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. <PERSON> Marwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudin </PERSON>, Jordanian minister of occupied territories, said the hijack `` contributed to harming the image of Arabs worldwide.'' <PERSON> Dudin </PERSON> said most Europeans link Islam and Arabs and connect any Moslem group with the fundamentalist revolution in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. <PERSON> Masri </PERSON> said the hijack should not affect the Arab image. `` After all we are the victims'' he said. Furthermore, he said: `` It is clear they -LRB- the hijackers -RRB- are backed by the Iranian regime.'' Although the current hijack is complicated by an alleged role played by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> _ which is Persian, not Arab _ it is not the first time Arabs have hurt the image of their cause by violent disunity. Infighting including assasinations have plagued the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. For 13 years the world has been seeing gory scenes of Arab killing <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> in the complicated carnage of the Lebanese civil war. In the summer of 1977, border clashes brought <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> to the brink of war.

<HEAD>One In Five Train Crews In Accidents Had Positive Drug, Alcohol
Test</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report shows that drug and alcohol abuse by railroad crew members has become `` a runaway train,'' a senator says. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa., offered that characterization on Wednesday after the report was released by <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> It reported that one in five crews involved in train accidents during 1987 had at least one member test positive for drugs or alcohol. The finding came during a review of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s policy of requiring railroad workers in major accidents to submit to drug and alcohol tests. On Feb. 11, the testing was struck down as unconstitutional by the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. But the program remains in place while the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration appeals. `` Substance abuse on the rails is fast becoming a runaway train,'' said <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, who requested the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> study. Of 179 accidents during 1987, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> found at least one positive drug or alcohol finding in 37, or about 20 percent. However, the report did not identify in how many of those cases the drugs or alcohol actually figured in the accident. In all, 42, or 5.5 percent, of 770 rail workers sampled last year following accidents tested positive for alcohol or illicit drugs, said the <ORGANIZATION> FRA </ORGANIZATION>, which released its own figures this week in answer to a reporter's query. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> also reported that the amount of time needed to report drug and alcohol test results has substantially improved. In April 1987, it took an average of 16.2 working days to report initial screening test results for accidents where all crew members tested negative. By October, the reporting time had been reduced to 4.8 working days, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. It takes longer when positive results are found, because they must be confirmed. <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> had complained that long lags were hampering investigations and unfairly placing suspicion on innocent crew members. FRA ended an agreement with a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> laboratory in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in March 1987 because it said it discovered discrepancies in the results, according to <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>. In April, <ORGANIZATION> FRA </ORGANIZATION> contracted with a toxicology center at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> for the tests.

<HEAD>Independent Elderly Live Longer</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Elderly people living alone are more likely to maintain their independence and live longer if they visit with friends and neighbors and attend church or other group events, a government study reports. And people over age 70 who live alone are more likely to survive over a two-year period than those who live with someone, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> found in the study made public Wednesday. Both living alone and engaging in various activities were indications of better health. The less active elderly were more likely to die or become institutionalized over time. There is a noticeable difference for those people who have contact with friends ands neighbors, who go to church or synagogue or attend sports events, reported Dr. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovar </PERSON>, author of the study. Her findings in `` Aging in the Eighties, People Living Alone _ Two Years Later'' are based on interviews in 1984 and 1986 with people who were 70 and older in 1984. Of those living alone who reported regular meetings with friends and neighbors in 1984, 92.5 percent were still alive two years later and 89.3 percent were still living on their own. On the other hand, of those who had no such contact, 86.6 percent survived two years and 81.5 percent still lived alone. For regular churchgoers in 1984, 94.9 percent survived two years and 91.9 percent were still alone. Of those who did n't attend church or synagogue, 86.2 percent survived and 81.9 percent lived on their own. But regular contact with family did not seem a significant factor in longer life and more independence. Perhaps those reporting extra family contacts needed the help because they were not well, <PERSON> Kovar </PERSON> speculated. `` Children may have come around more frequently ... just to make sure'' the older folks were all right, she said. `` The most important thing -LRB- found in the study -RRB- is the stability,'' <PERSON> Kovar </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` Most of these people, two years later, are still living in the community. Those who were living alone are still alone, and those with someone else are still with someone else,'' she said. `` As you would expect, because these people are 72 or older, death rates are high. But relatively few of them are in nursing homes,'' she noted. Of nearly 6.4 million elderly people living alone in 1984, 89.8 percent were still alive two years later, she found. By comparison, 89.0 percent of those living with a spouse survived two years and 84.3 percent who had been living with someone else were still alive. Of those who had been on their own in 1984, <PERSON> Kovar </PERSON> found that by 1986, 77.8 percent were still living by themselves. Some 7.4 percent of them had moved in with someone else _ most often family _ and 4.6 percent were in an institution. `` It certainly appears that for some of them life is better'' two years later, she added. `` Some have remarried _ not many but some _ and when we asked those who had moved why ... we got'' answers ranging from health to being nearer to children to spending the summer in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and winter in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. One, she said, even cited lower golf fees for moving. A major factor in continued independence is likely that those living alone were more healthy at the start of the study, she concluded in the report. Health was also a factor in the stability of those living alone, she found. For example, people who needed help with basic daily activities such as bathing, dressing, eating or using the toilet, were much more likely to have died over the two year span. While only about 10 percent of all those living alone died in the two year period, 25 percent of those who had needed help in basic daily activities died and 16 percent were in nursing homes after two years. `` It is very difficult ... to disentangle'' all the factors affecting these people, she said. Another follow-up series of interviews is scheduled for this summer, to compare the same group of elderly in 1988. Overall, she found that nursing homes appear to be a last resort for the elderly. These is evidence of a progression, she reported, `` people live alone, then with other people if others are available, then they may become nursing home residents.''

<HEAD>FmHA Plans to Erase $8.8 Billion in Farm Debt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some $ 8.8 billion in lingering debt owed by agricultural producers will be wiped from the books of the <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> under a measure approved by lawmakers last year, the agency's administrator says. `` It is true that we are probably writing off upwards of $ 8 billion to $ 9 billion over the next couple of years and the agricultural credit act is responsible for a substantial portion of that,'' <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations panel Wednesday. Under provisions of the Farm Credit Act approved last year, <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> will `` write down,'' or defer payments, on $ 2.1 billion in debt owed by farmers who will be restored to profitability as a result, the agency said. Eventually, it said, the government may still be able to recover some of that money. But it said would simply write off $ 6.7 billion in non-performing loans to farmers who even with such help will not be able to turn a profit. Last year's legislation required the government to take such actions if they would be less expensive for the taxpayers than foreclosure. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s disclosure followed an unconfirmed report last month that the government most likely would write off $ 7 billion in FmHA loans. The disclosure came in response to a question from Sen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, who had seen the earlier published report and was concerned about it. <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON> was critical of <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, however, for saying that it was the Farm Credit Act that was costing the money. He said that in every case foreclosure would have been more expensive and thus the taxpayers were not losing anything that they would not have lost anyway. `` They're including costs that would have been there even if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had not passed the bill,'' <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON> said. He called the foreclosure-expense test `` a very objective, bottom line decision that really means what <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed is n't costing the federal government anything.

 An electric shock device intended to help keep disturbed people from injuring themselves is being labeled medieval torture by opponents while supporters call it a miracle. `` This thing works,'' said retired Marine Col. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> McShane </PERSON>, the father of severely retarded 37-year-old twins. `` There is a case ... for this device.'' <PERSON> McShane </PERSON> jumped up to praise the so-called self-injurious behavior inhibiting system -LRB- SIBIS -RRB- Wednesday at a news conference organized by 13 national groups seeking to stop its sale to doctors and psychologists. He interrupted the presentation to say his daughters' lives had been transformed from the first hour they started wearing the self-activating device, which administers an electric shock when a person inflicts a blow on himself. `` They've stopped tearing their clothes off. They've stopped hitting themselves,'' <PERSON> McShane </PERSON> said of his daughters, who are living in an Italian institution run by nuns. `` They now sit and have their dinner with their two roommates. They can participate. ... I fully intend to let them wear them for the rest of their lives,'' he said. An estimated 50,000 severely retarded or autistic people suffer from the mysterious syndrome in which they bang their heads against the floor or wall or beat their heads and faces with their fists. Drugs and physical restraints are often used to try to stop the self-inflicted blows when other approaches fail. SIBIS was reviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and registered last June for commercial sale and distribution. It consists of lightweight headgear and an arm or leg band, and delivers a shock an opponent described as painful and a supporter compared to a `` one-tenth of a second pinprick.'' The association for Retarded Citizens, the <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Autism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> were among the groups denouncing SIBIS as unconstitutional and punitive. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Laski </PERSON>, a lawyer from the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said the device violates `` the most fundamental concepts of personal dignity, personal autonomy and due process.'' He said it was `` neither humane nor effective.'' `` Let us not return to the Dark Ages,'' said <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Salzano </PERSON>, mother of a 30-year-old autistic son. `` It is my philosophy that the disabled have the same rights as everyone else in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Several speakers said other approaches are effective in treating the problem and have a longer-lasting impact than SIBIS. They said they are concerned that the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approved the device without published evidence that it works and without standards for its use. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Linscheid </PERSON>, a professor of pediatrics and psychology at <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who observed the news conference, said he is compiling data `` that prove very definitively that this has been a very effective procedure.'' He said psychologists who support SIBIS do not necessarily oppose positive behavior modification techniques and in fact the two can complement each other. `` If I can stop this person from hitting himself 3,000 times in a six-hour school day, I can do more positive reinforcement,'' he said. `` It gives me a window of opportunity.'' <PERSON> Linscheid </PERSON> also said desperate parents should not be deprived of anything that seems to work. He cited a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> teen-ager who was in restraints for 10 years but has gained 60 pounds, feeds himself and is toilet trained since starting with SIBIS. `` It's pretty hard to say to parents, ` take that away,''' he said Asked about potential misuse of the device, <PERSON> Linscheid </PERSON> said the disabled are protected by many advocacy groups and added, `` We ca n't say that because there's a chance for abuse, we ca n't use it at all.''

<TEXT>
 Former Attorney General <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> is representing the survivors of 15 Libyans killed during the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing raid of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> two years ago in a civil suit for damages against the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, who has been criticized in the past for dealing with nations hostile to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, filed the lawsuit Wednesday to collect unspecified damages for the deaths, property damage and injuries to 40 other Libyans. The suit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, charged that the April 14, 1986 bombing violated `` settled principles of international law'' in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Charter and numerous treaties and declarations. It charged the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration purposely hid the real purpose of the bombing _ which the suit said was to kill <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghadafi </PERSON> and to `` terrorize Libyans by inflicting injury upon the civilian population in order to undermine support'' for their leader. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the raid was in retaliation for the anti-American attacks authorized by <PERSON> Ghadafi </PERSON>, including the bombing of a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> discotheque frequented by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen that killed two and injured 150 others. The lawsuit charged that top governent officials, including President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, `` are guilty of conduct constituting clear violations of settled principles of international law prohibiting the use of force by a state against the territorial integrity of political independence of another state.'' Among the victims of the bombing raid was a 3-month-old girl who died when hit by shrapnel while asleep in her home in <LOCATION> Benghazi </LOCATION>. The child's 38-year-old father was also killed by shrapnel, according to the complaint. The suit, filed under the Alien Tort Statute and the Federal Tort Claims Act, said claims for compensation by the victims or their survivors were rejected last October by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. The suit named <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> individually and in his capacity as commander in chief of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> armed forces. British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> was sued for approving the use of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to launch the attacks. Also sued were former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> and top military officials, including Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> and retired Gen. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, former supreme allied commender in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The estate of the late <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> was also named as a defendant in the case, which was assigned to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Penfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, who served as attorney general under President <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, has been criticized over several years for dealing with foreign governments whose interests conflict with this country. In 1980 he attended a `` Crimes of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' conference in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> while American hostages were being held in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. He also was criticized in 1972 for traveling to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> to investigate the effects of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing during the Vietnam War.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s new tank plating which uses depleted uranium may not curb the large Soviet advantage in the race to develop the best armor and the deadliest way of attacking those defenses, according to an Army armor specialist. `` It's too early to tell how effective it is,'' retired Army Gen. <PERSON> Donn </PERSON> <PERSON> Starry </PERSON> told reporters. Starry specialized in armor systems before he retired last year as commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s Training and <ORGANIZATION> Doctrine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, where he was responsible for helping develop tank warfare doctrine. The new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> armor was unveiled last month by <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officials, who said it would be `` a significant enhancement'' of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> capabilities for the M-1A1 <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, the main <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> battle tank. A statement by the service said the new armor would `` allow the <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> to meet the anticipated threat well into the 1990s.'' Speaking to a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee Wednesday, <PERSON> Starry </PERSON> offered an extremely negative assessment of the U.S.-Soviet balance in armor and anti-armor weapons. None of the top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> anti-tank weapons is likely to work against front-line Soviet tanks because the Soviets have developed innovative armor, <PERSON> Starry </PERSON> told the conventional forces subcommittee. The Soviets have a roughly 3-1 advantage in tanks stationed in western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials have argued that many of the Soviet weapons are far older and thus likely to be less effective than Western tanks. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations have stockpiled thousands of anti-tank missiles, such as the Dragon, several types of TOWs and the Hellfire. None of them would work, <PERSON> Starry </PERSON> said, because the Soviets have developed reactive armor that uses both a ceramic cover and a series of `` applique boxes.'' The latter, developed by the Israelis a decade ago, are specially designed boxes containing explosives which blow up when hit by an incoming explosive. The explosion of the box dissipates and dilutes the force of the incoming weapon. `` The unhappy fact is that tanks with reactive armor on top of built-in glass composite or ceramic laminate armor will quite likely defeat the warheads of all deployed'' weapons used by Western forces, he said. Starry's views took some senators by surprise. Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, asked Starry, `` Are you including Hellfire?'' His reference was to the missile carried by the Apache, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s newest attack helicopter and a weapon that was designed specifically to defeat Soviet tanks. `` Yes,'' said <PERSON> Starry </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the subcommittee, asked, `` Are you saying that if we went to war, our bullets and missiles would bounce off Soviet tanks? `` That's correct,'' said <PERSON> Starry </PERSON>. In 1985, <PERSON> Starry </PERSON> took part in a study by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which concluded that the Soviets had an advantage over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in armor and in attacking armor. The study described the situation as a matter of `` national urgency.'' The situation is worse now, he said. `` Today, it is my judgment that we have crossed the threshold; the situation is now a matter of considerable national urgency.'' Army officials told the subcommittee Wednesday they agreed with Starry's assessment of the <ORGANIZATION> DSB </ORGANIZATION> report in 1985 and the current situation. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> agreed with the <ORGANIZATION> DSB </ORGANIZATION> conclusions in 1985 and still agrees with the conclusion that we are behind the Soviets. We need to regain the lead and maintain that advantage,'' said Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pihl </PERSON>, deputy to the assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> for research and development.

<TEXT>
 Most black and Jewish voters have coalesced around the two chief competitors in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Democratic presidential primary but other potentially large voting blocs remain fragmented, political analysts say. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s attempt to outflank Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for the Jewish vote appears destined to fall short, an expert in Jewish opinion said Wednesday. And <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s strength remains greatest with blacks, said other experts. The analysts said other major groups _ such as union members, homosexuals and <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholics </ORGANIZATION> _ do not seem to be drawn to any of the candidates by a single overriding issue in next Tuesday's vote. What then may come into play for these <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> voters is the pragmatic issue of which candidate is most likely to win the presidency, said <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frucher </PERSON>, a leading political strategist. A key battle has been for Jews, up to a quarter of the Democratic vote. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has sought their support by placing himself to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' right on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> policy, flatly opposing formation of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. The hard line may help <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, where 25 percent of the 400,000 Jews are in the Orthodox sect, said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a sociology professor at <ORGANIZATION> Queens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> who has polled Jewish attitudes for a decade. But the effort likely will fail overall, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said, because <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> are close enough on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> policy for either to be acceptable to the majority of Jews, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appeals to them on other grounds. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is seen as friendly because he's a Northeast liberal ethnic,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. `` He's our type of guy.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has received black backing in the 90-percent range in other states, and blacks, like Jews, account for up to a quarter of the Democratic vote in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He also may count on broad support from Hispanics, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Alicea </PERSON>, a Hispanic leader. But in 1984, Hispanics made up just 4 percent of the state primary vote. Organized labor is divided, said <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kheel </PERSON>, a longtime labor mediator in the city. The Central Labor Council and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> are neutral, he said, while local leaders `` are all over the lot.'' In the absence of a defining issue, <ORGANIZATION> Catholics </ORGANIZATION> also do not constitute a strong voting block, and `` I do n't think there's going to be a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> groundswell for any <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, editor of The Tablet, the newspaper of the Archdiocese of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>. Nonetheless, said pollster <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Miringoff </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION>, `` I think the white ethnic vote is going to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at this point.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, a Greek-American, also expects enthusiastic support from the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> community, which has about 65,000 adult <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens in the city. Homosexuals are in far more of a quandary. Many activists reject <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> because of his opposition to homosexual couples as foster parents, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Lambda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and Education Fund. But many fear <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> or <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> would lose to the Republican. The result is that some voters will go for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who is viewed overall as better on homosexual issues, said <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON>. Those less concerned about the foster parent issues will back <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. A few will vote for <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, whose standing is `` uncertain'' on homosexual issues other than AIDS. `` Some,' <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> added, `` will simply stay home.''

<HEAD>Lawmakers Ask Unions to Accept End to Trade Bill's Plant-Closings
Plan</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Democratic leaders are asking unions to go along with dropping mandatory notice of plant closings from the sweeping congressional trade bill because of threats of a presidential veto. But union representatives refused to relent Wednesday in a three-hour meeting with the leaders behind closed doors, according to sources who asked not to be identified by name. `` We're still searching,'' House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, told reporters following the session in the office of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. Va.. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> declined to go Warnings that the plant-closings measure could prompt President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to use his veto power and thus scuttle the entire 1,000-page trade bill failed to move representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> and several other labor groups, according to the sources. Under the provision in question, companies with at least 100 employees would be required to provide 60 days notice of plant closings and layoffs involving at least one-third of their work force. Layoffs involving 500 workers or more would have to be preceded by notice even if less than one-third of the work force is involved. Labor representatives called on the leaders to push forward with the plant-closings provision in defiance of repeated veto threats from members of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Cabinet. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> issued the latest warning Tuesday. Labor representatives left the session without commenting to reporters, as did a number of congressional participants. Besides <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, those on hand were <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass The disputed measure, part of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version of the trade bill but not that passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, has aroused passionate opposition among several business groups. They say it could be the first step toward taking control of companies away from management. Supporters say something must be done to end circumstances in which factory workers with families arrive at work to find that the plant is closed permanently and their job has vanished. At the heart of the trade bill are provisions that would transfer to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative authority to retaliate against international violations by the nation's trading partners and other `` unjustifiable'' practices. The president currently has that authority. Main provisions also would streamline machinery for imposing import curbs to aid threatened <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industries. The bill contains scores of other provisions ranging from repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil companies to tighter monitoring of lamb imports. In recent days, a chief concern of lawmakers has been finding a formula that would guarantee that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would sign the bill. A hint that leaders were leaning toward dropping the provision came earlier Wednesday when <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told reporters it would still represent `` a good bill'' if shorn of the plant-closings feature. He did say it would be `` a better bill with that provision'' included. Republicans, who furnished much of the opposition to the plant-closings provision, were not party to the talks with labor representatives. But dropping the provision could prove a touchy matter. Sponsors, including Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, D-Calif., pressed ahead and succeeded in inserting the feature in the bill amid a hailstorm of administration veto threats <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, the only plant-closings sponsor in the afternoon session, was asked during a brief break whether he was making any progress in saving the measure. He said merely: `` We'll see.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>, in a study last year, estimated that two out of every three workers are not told they are losing their job until the day they are taken off the payroll. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> said in a report last June that the voluntary notices advocated by the administration and business do not now provide workers with the `` minimum two or three months necessary to adjust successfully to job loss.''

<HEAD>Administration Waited Four Years To Act On Law Protecting Dolphins</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Senators are criticizing the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for taking four years to implement a law aimed at reducing the number of dolphins that drown when they are snared by huge tuna nets in the eastern <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. `` Wholly inadequate,'' says <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass. `` An embarrassment,'' adds <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., one of the authors of the 1984 law passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in an effort to put teeth into the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 The 1984 statute requires the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to bar importation of tuna caught by a foreign nation if its tuna boats fail to take steps to protect dolphins, as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tuna industry is required to do. `` The foreign tuna fleet in the eastern tropical <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> is killing over 100,000 dolphins a year and our government agencies have done little to implement the 1984 changes designed to address the problem,'' <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said Wednesday at a <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearing. <PERSON> Dolphin </PERSON> kills began increasing in the late 1950s, when tuna fishermen switched from baited hooks to gigantic seines. For reasons unclear to biologists, the popular yellowfin tuna congregate beneath groups of surface-swimming dolphin, which then serve to mark the tuna schools to fishing boats. Conservationists estimate that some 6 million of the mammals have drowned over the years after being trapped in tuna nets. `` We face a serious situation in the tropical <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>,'' testified <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mammal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. He said preliminary findings from a dolphin census show some stocks are smaller than thought and others are declining. Because of improved netting techniques, the number of Dolphin kills by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tuna boats has dropped from 368,000 in 1972 to 13,992 last year, the hearing was told. Foreign kills reportedly fell from 423,678 in 1972 to an estimated maximum of 82,000, compared to 108,767 in 1986 and 37,505 in 1985. Only recently did the fisheries service publish regulations to carry out the 1984 law. They would give foreign tuna fleets until 1991 to match the performance of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fleet, which is allowed to kill up to 20,500 dolphins a year. `` Why are we waiting until 1991?'' asked Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif. `` I think we should pursue why it will take until 1991 to impose these import restrictions. <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said, `` It bothers me enormously we've allowed this situation to drag on. It's really sad. I do n't know what you people are doing sitting down there.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s acting assistant administrator for fisheries, said, `` we're not particularly proud of the amount of time it took to do these regulations.'' He said regulators walked a tightrope, wanting to reduce foreign fleet dolphin kills without causing other nations to give up the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market and continue to fish for tuna without adopting techniques to save dolphins. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Burney </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tuna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, an industry group, said foreign tuna fleets should adopt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> methods. `` There is no excuse for them not having done that,'' he said. `` It should have been done three years ago.''

The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said he had merely reflected existing American and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> policy in holding open the option of a nuclear response to a successful Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> with conventional forces. The <LOCATION> Tennesse </LOCATION> senator offered broader criticism as well, faulting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for advocating a ban on flight testing of ballistic missiles and for what he said were remarks supporting the commitment of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops in the event of Communist invaders in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. `` I think in a lot of these matters he simply does n't know what he's talking about, and he needs an opportunity to clarify his remarks and I want to give him an opportuhity to do so,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said to reporters. A long-distance exchange between the two candidates was touched off by an interview with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> published Wednesday in the Daily News of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> characterized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' remarks as amounting to saying `` he would launch a nuclear first strike against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> if they invaded <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> with conventional forces.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, insisted <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was distorting his comments. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said his position was that he would consider the use of nuclear forces as an option in the event of a successful Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` That has been the policy of our government,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` It is the policy of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance.'' In a transcript provided by the newspaper, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was asked if he could conceive of a scenario in which he would use nuclear weapons first, `` as a strategic weapon.'' His response began, `` Yes, yes. I would hope I would n't have to.'' He said he was for `` a policy of no early first use. But our present strategy in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> assumes that if the Soviets were to invade and conventional forces could n't stop them that we'd reserve the right to use nuclear force.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, the defense and foreign policy adviser to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> started answering the question thinking he was being asked about tactical nuclear weapons. The reference to `` strategic'' was made after <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had started speaking, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said he assumed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would have given a different answer had he understood the question to be about strategic nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> insisted <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had not distorted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' words. Both <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had erred in getting into a discussion of nuclear first use. `` I think it is most unwise for a president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or a major candidate for the presidency to be drawn into a hypothetical discussion of when we would launch our nuclear forces and trigger destruction of human civilization,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. `` To specify in advance when we would make that fateful step is most unwise and irresponsible.'' Appearing later before <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Democrats in <LOCATION> Rye </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> stressed that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had been asked about `` strategic'' nuclear weapons. `` <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has purposely refused to respond to that hypothetical,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. `` The president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has traditionally refused to respond to that hypothetical.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s criticism and the ensuing flap overshadowed an event Wednesday when <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> went to the Love Canal toxic waste site at <LOCATION> Niagra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> to underscore his commitment to environmental protection and blast the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. As a congressman, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> chaired congressional hearings that looked into the dumping of toxic wastes at the site.

<HEAD>Soviet Pullout Won't End Effect Of `Dirty War' On Soviet Life</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> called it the nation's `` bleeding wound. <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, the human rights activist and Nobel Peace laureate, branded it `` one of the great tragedies of our times.'' Costly in lives, money and Soviet prestige, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s military intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> has become a national trauma With the stroke of a pen in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> today, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> committed itself to withdrawing its troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, but that ca n't remove all the shadows cast over <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> diplomacy and peoples' lives. By agreeing to pull out forces sent into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> beginning Dec. 27, 1979, to replace one pro-Marxist regime with another, the Soviets _ like the Americans in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> _ have acknowledged their inability to keep bearing the human and diplomatic costs of an anti-guerrilla war in a foreign land. But while the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> may end its engagement, few expect the fighting to cease outright. And there are indications the Soviets may continue shipping weapons to their former comrades in arms after their estimated 115,000 troops return home. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has been on the ground in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> for more than eight years, more than twice as long as it took the Soviets in World War II to drive the invading German armies back to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Thousands of young Soviet men have been killed in the Afghan fighting, thousands more wounded, and billions of rubles poured into the war and accompanying efforts to make mountainous and underdeveloped <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> into a socialist country. This year the Soviets abandoned any pretense of seeking to define their neighbor's future, with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> saying on Feb. 8 that the political and economic system of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is `` none of our business.'' The drive into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, launched when the late <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> was in power in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, poisoned the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s relations with other Moslem and Third World countries and doomed detente between the superpowers From the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> withdrawal of the SALT II arms control treaty and the boycott of the 1980 <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Olympics by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 61 other nations to the canceling of grain and other trade agreements involving foreign suppliers, the Soviets paid the price for sending tanks and troops across the Afghan border. Last November at the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, 123 nations, the largest total to date, voted for a resolution calling for the immediate and total withdrawal of foreign forces from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` The main question about <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is not the truth about the horrors and the deaths, but why are we there?'' one Soviet war veteran wrote in the weekly magazine <ORGANIZATION> Ogonyok </ORGANIZATION> last year. Many Soviets say that question has never been answered. `` <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is one of the great tragedies of our times that has caused a worsening in international relations, led to the death of many people and created a foyer of tension in the world,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said in February. A <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> newspaper editor recently told a Western reporter of receiving a letter from a man whose only son was killed in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` Now the others are coming home,'' the writer of the letter said. `` But what did my boy die for?'' The editor said he anguished over how to reply, and confessed, `` I have a stack of those letters on my desk, and I must answer each one. But I do n't know what to say.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in February that the `` memory of those who have died a hero's death in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is sacred to us,'' and that Soviet soldiers sent there `` have been performing their duty honestly, performing acts of self-denial and heroism.'' In recent weeks, state-run media have issued gloomy and pessimistic reports on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, presumably to prepare Soviet citizens for continued strife there, and the media has accused Moslem guerrillas of accelerating fighting in that country's 10-year-old civil war just as chances for peace improve `` Terror on the eve of settlement,'' was the headline on one <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency dispatch this week, which accused the guerrillas fighting the Soviet-backed government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> of `` planting mines'' on the road to a peaceful settlement. Under the agreement negotiated at the U.N.-sponsored talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, Soviet troops are to begin their march home May 15 in a pullout to be completed within nine months. All should be back home by the end of the year, Soviet officials have said privately. Under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s campaign for more openness, Soviet newspapers and television have become more frank about the hardships faced by soldiers sent to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, and by returning veterans who meet with official indifference or hostility. However, the horrors of the fighting in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, which Western sources say has resulted in up to 1 million civilian deaths and 5 million refugees, have only been spottily reported in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> media. The Soviet people have never been told how many of their sons have been killed or wounded in the war, and officials refuse to say publicly even how many Soviet troops are deployed. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has estimated Soviet casualties since 1979 at 33,000-38 ,000, more than one-third of whom were killed Those figures do not include `` heavy losses'' to disease, the department said in a report issued in December. Reluctance to admit the full tragedy of the war, and the scope of <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> involvement, exists throughout Soviet society. Graves of slain soldiers do not specify they were killed in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, some parents have publicly complained, and government spokesman continue to refer to the conflict as `` the situation around <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' rather than a war. In November, a veteran writing in <LOCATION> Ogonyok </LOCATION> urged <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> journalists to be forthright and `` call a dirty war a dirty war.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s current plans for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> are uncertain. On Wednesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said that under the accords reached in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would continue aiding the Afghan rebels if the Soviets supply weapons to <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Perfilyev </PERSON> said on Tuesday the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> hopes chances for peace in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> `` will continue to evolve positively, and we hope the issue of arms supplies will not remain long on the agenda.''

 A couple who fled their subsidized housing because they said it was inhabited by supernatural forces will get to argue their case in court. <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON>, who left their house last year with their three teen-age daughters, are claiming they should be given another government house because they are homeless. The city has refused. The judge, Sir <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON>, said on Wednesday that he will allow a full High Court hearing even though the circumstances of the case are `` highly unusual.'' No hearing date was set. The Costellos claim they saw moving furniture, a guitar playing itself, power plugs being pulled from sockets and paper being mysteriously ripped from a typewriter that had turned itself on. They claim police and social workers also saw some of the events. The city is housing the family in an inexpensive hotel but has refused to give them another government home.

 In a junior high classroom in a state with fewer than 3,000 Jews, sociologist <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hildebrandt </PERSON> holds up a photograph of <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and speaks about the need to be a `` witness'' to the Holocaust. `` What were Aryans?'' <PERSON> Hildebrandt </PERSON> asked his <ORGANIZATION> Keene </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> students Wednesday. <PERSON> Hildebrandt </PERSON> directs the <ORGANIZATION> Keene </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holocaust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a library of more than 1,400 books, thousands of articles, films, slides and videotapes that opened in 1983. The five `` gifted and talented'' children whose parents permitted them to attend the optional, after-school course screwed up their faces, indicating they did n't know about Aryans. `` They were supposed to be the super-race with blonde hair, blue eyes, tall and strong,'' said <PERSON> Hildebrandt </PERSON>. `` The supermen that would conquer the world, the super-race that would destroy all these inferior races like the Jews.'' The children, who like <PERSON> Hildebrandt </PERSON> are <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>, nodded solemnly. This week, as groups across the country hold Holocaust memorials to mark the 45th anniversary of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> ghetto uprisings, <PERSON> Hildebrandt </PERSON> is doing his part to ensure that the 6 million Jews who died in Nazi death camps are not forgotten and that similar atrocities never happen again. Education is `` what it's all about,'' he said. His lesson is not lost on some of his students. `` It's not going to happen again because we listen and because they're teaching us about it. If no one had said anything, then it could easily happen again,'' said 11-year-old <PERSON> Erin </PERSON> <PERSON> Buzuvis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hildebrandt </PERSON> was asked why <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> needed the Holocaust center, since its Jewish population is estimated by the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manchesterat </ORGANIZATION> at fewer than 3,000, or less than one-third of one percent of the population. `` Why not?'' he replied. `` There should be a center everywhere.'' As the state's handful of concentration camp survivors and liberators die, it's even more important to convey the facts, he said. <PERSON> Hildebrandt </PERSON> says many textbook writers are minimizing the Holocaust; some even question the facts. `` There has to be a witness,'' he said. <PERSON> Hildebrandt </PERSON> does not dwell on the horror, but believes that explaining the true events gradually is important. But how does a teacher gradually describe genocide? How can gas chambers and starvation be introduced without trauma? <PERSON> Hildebrandt </PERSON> advises elementary school teachers simply to begin with classes on prejudice and less gruesome topics. For more advanced children, he recommends two books: One is about a little girl, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanche </PERSON>, who sneaks food through the barbed wire fence at a death camp. Her name, which means white rose, is also the name of a German youth group that resisted <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and eventually was eliminated. Another is about a little girl discovering concentration camp numbers tatooed on her grandfather's arm and his explaining how they got there. The book, illustrated by photographs of a girl and an <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> survivor, ends with the granddaughter saying, `` You should n't be ashamed to let people see your number. You did n't do anything wrong. It's the Nazis who should be ashamed.'' By junior high and high school, <PERSON> Hildebrandt </PERSON> says, students generally are better able to hear a more complete truth. Still, a couple of the children displayed some prejudices that seem to indicate why Holocaust education is important _ especially in areas with few minorities. `` It could n't happen again because ... Jews are n't so Jewish anymore,'' said one. `` They're more civilized,'' said another. `` They know more. They act more like regular people.''

<TEXT>
 The federal government has chipped in $ 11,000 to help save the 12-foot, gurgling earthworms that transformed <PERSON> Korumburra </PERSON> from a near ghost town to a bustling tourist attraction. Several years ago, <PERSON> Korumburra </PERSON> decided to promote the invertebrate, which has 16 hearts and is a hermaphrodite, meaning it is both male and female. The great <LOCATION> Gippsland </LOCATION> gurgling earthworm is so named because of the sucking and gurgling noises it makes when it burrows, sounding like a bathtub draining water. Townsfolk credit the earthworm, whose scientific name is megascolides australis, for helping turn their fortunes around. An annual worm festival called <LOCATION> Karmai </LOCATION>, after the aboriginal word for giant earthworm, is held each March. It celebrates the worm with parades, carnivals and even an earthworm queen. Recently, however, intensive farming in the worm's small habitat has raised fears the worms' days are numbered. <LOCATION> Korumburra </LOCATION> is in <LOCATION> Gippsland </LOCATION>, an area of the southeast state of <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> that once was covered by a rain forest where the worms thrived. Today, that habitat has been reduced to an area of 100 square miles around the <LOCATION> Bass </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Settlers, who thought the worms were snakes, cleared <LOCATION> Gippsland </LOCATION>'s rain forest with its 300-foot trees in the 1880s to make room for dairy farming and cattle raising Although not officially protected, the earthworm is now listed as endangered, according to worm expert <PERSON> Georgina </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> of the Australian Museum. Federal Environment Minister <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> announced an $ 11,000 save-the-worm grant last week as part of a $ 383,000 package to study other threatened species in <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>, such as the koala bear and the fairy penguin. <PERSON> Korumburra </PERSON> began exploiting the earthworm as a tourist attraction in 1977 after the local coal mine went bust, a butter plant shut down and young people began heading to <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION>, 75 miles away, in search of jobs. `` The worm saved the town,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, on whose property most of the worms are found. `` The worms helped people have an identity. I do n't know if they're proud of what they've got but we've got something unique. We've got a thing that is dropping off the face of the earth.'' Promoting the giant worms was n't easy, local tourist offical <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholl </PERSON> admits. `` Of all things in the world, how do you promote a worm?'' she told a recent visitor. `` It started out as a fun thing but now it's very serious. Now when visitors arrive the first thing they ask is ` Where is the worm?''' Visitors now flock to <LOCATION> Korumburra </LOCATION>, population 2,800. The town's shops display fluffy toy worms and cute cutouts on windows, colored pink because brown, the worm's natural color, is n't attractive Festivities climax with a 100-foot fake worm resembling a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> dragon that is hoisted and weaved through main street by 60 or 70 children. A nocturnal animal, the worms are difficult to dig up and residents discourage the practice because the worms can break apart and bleed to death when yanked from the rich clay on which they thrive. Townsfolk proclaim the worm as the world's largest, although long worms are found elsewhere in the world. Despite their fame, the local worms remain underground. There is no worm museum in <LOCATION> Korumburra </LOCATION> or even a display. However, entrepreneurs <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Zoanetti </PERSON> opened a worm attraction at Bass, 25 miles down the highway toward the <LOCATION> Phillip </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> penguin reserve, a major tourist attraction. There, visitors enter a 300-foot-long building shaped like an earthworm and can walk through a section that simulates the internal view of the worm's stomach, complete with gurgling noises. Visitors also experience a worm's eye view of its world below ground. With a $ 3 entry fee for adults, up to 1,000 people visit the attraction daily.

 <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s key stock market indicator closed Thursday at an all-time high, surpassing the 27,000-point level for the first time, while the dollar eased against the Japanese yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 54.71-point winner Wednesday, added another 125.80 points, or 0.46 percent, finishing the day at 27,111.35. The dollar closed at 126.15 yen, down 0.30 yen from its 126.45 yen finish on Wednesday. It had opened the day at 126.20 yen and ranged between 126.10-126 .43 yen A dealer at a major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment firm, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday's meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of top finance officials from seven major industrialized powers produced `` nothing substantial.'' The so-called Group of Seven nations are the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. In issuing its two-page joint communique Wednesday, the group announced the extension of a Dec. 22 agreement in which the seven nations pledged to work together to keep the dollar currency from falling further against the yen. `` The market was not looking for anything concrete from the meeting,'' and it resulted in nothing new, the dealer said. He said Thursday's release in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures for February would have a greater effect on the movement of the dollar, and likely would support the currency. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit reports have affected the dollar's direction in recent years because the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration has supported a lower dollar as a way of narrowing the gap.

Despite the wishes of <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON> <PERSON> Kristian </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON>' 21-year-old mother and the couple that has cared for her since her birth July 20, a judge has ruled that the child must be turned over today to <LOCATION> Navajo </LOCATION> authorities. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON>, who gave up <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON> so that she could have a life away from the reservation in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, says she'll fight to get her back and return her to the would-be adoptive parents, <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON>. `` I love my baby and want her to get something out of life,'' she said tearfully at the <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON>' home Wednesday. The Pittses, saying they are `` devastated'' by the prospect of losing the baby they love and helped bring into the world, still hope to get her back but are n't sure what will happen next. <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON> said her mother, who was brought to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for the court hearings, was threatened with prison if the baby were not returned. `` They've hassled my whole family,'' said <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON>, who has eight brothers and sisters. The Navajo Nation's <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, citing the Indian Child Welfare Act, filed a complaint in <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in February to gain jurisdiction of the case and stop the Pittses' adoption petition. Navajo officials said the adoption was illegal and demanded the baby be sent to the reservation. After two hearings, Judge <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> ordered the Pittses to give up the child, ruling that <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON> was under tribal jurisdiction and legally resided on the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> reservation she has visited only occasionally in recent years. Rather than appeal <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>' ruling, the <PERSON> Pittses </PERSON> decided Wednesday to drop their adoption petition and fight to return custody of <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Keetso </LOCATION>. Eventually, they hope to get <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON> back. <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> planned to accompany <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON> back to <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and try to persuade <LOCATION> Navajo </LOCATION> authorities to let them care for the baby, who suffers from severe asthma. <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON> was pregnant when she met the Pittses through an adoption attorney's advertisement. The couple, both 33 and parents of an 8-year-old boy, took <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON> into their home. They gave her $ 200 a month spending money, paid medical costs, coached her through labor and brought <PERSON> Allyssa </PERSON> home. <PERSON> Keetso </PERSON> said the Indian Child Welfare Act was designed to protect children. `` It was never supposed to do this, to take a baby from its mother or interfere with a mother's decision about her child,'' she said. `` The welfare people do n't really care about anyone's feelings. They're treating my baby like an object. They just want to take her to prove a point.'' Indian welfare officials in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> declined to comment about the case. Violet A.P. <PERSON> Lui </PERSON>, the attorney handling the case at the <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, did not return several phone calls. The Pittses have been encouraged by <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fork </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, who recently won a highly publicized, seven-year custody fight with Navajo authorities over 10-year <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Halloway </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. `` We spoke to them last night and they told us the only way we can win is to go public and tell our story to anyone who'll listen,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> said `` I love my baby. I've waited a long time for her. The bond we have is very strong,'' she said. `` Sometimes she wo n't go to anybody else. She wakes up at night crying and does n't want to let go of us.''

 A package from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> to the father of a high school basketball star contained $ 1,000 in cash, a newspaper reported today. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' <ORGANIZATION> Fairfax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, his father and university officials denied any knowledge of the money, the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> signed a Nov. 11 letter of intent to accept a basketball scholarship from the university, which was reprimanded last month by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collegiate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for minor violations after a lengthy investigation of alleged substantial payments made to other players. University President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roselle </PERSON>, in a statement Wednesday, said the school learned Friday of possible new <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> violations from a <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reporter's telephone call, and asked for <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> help to investigate. `` It is our intention to find out what happened, to report everything we find to the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION>, to take full responsibility for whatever is proved to have occurred,'' he said. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, one of the top high school basketball players in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, was heavily recruited across the nation. The 6-foot-7 <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> 4-A player of the year in 1987 scored an average of 28.3 points a game. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Smrt </PERSON>, an investigator for the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION>, was in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.

He acknowledged that an Emery employee told him a package containing cash was addressed to him and was awaiting delivery. His son said Friday that he knew nothing about any money from the university, according to the newspaper. Officials at <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> denied any wrongdoing. `` I can promise you it did n't occur,'' said <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> head basketball coach <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> officials said serious penalties could be imposed if the allegation is substantiated. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborn </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Emery </PERSON> employee who found an opened package when it arrived in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said he looked inside and saw money sticking out of a videocassette box. His supervisor, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, said he called over several employees as witnesses and counted out $ 1,000 in $ 50 bills and then had the package sealed by security personnel. <PERSON> Claud </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> acknowledged he received a videotape from <LOCATION> Casey </LOCATION> on March 31. He said his son signed for the package and that when he got home he found the videotape, but no cash, in the opened packet. `` I did n't receive no money from <PERSON> Dwane </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Claud </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said. `` Nobody from <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> gave me no money.

 The Honduran <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> began hearings on the deportation of a reputed drug baron to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that caused violent protests and forced the government to impose a state of emergency.

He also was wanted for questioning by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities in connection with the 1985 torture-slaying in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>. Col. <PERSON> Leonel </PERSON> <PERSON> Riera </PERSON> <PERSON> Lunatti </PERSON>, commander of the public security forces, testified behind closed doors for over two hours on Wednesday before a congressional commission investigating the deportation. <PERSON> Riera </PERSON> <PERSON> Lunatti </PERSON> arrived at the legislative chambers surrounded by security guards and declined to comment to reporters. But <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rufino </PERSON> <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON>, chairman of the hearing, said <PERSON> Riera </PERSON> <PERSON> Lunatti </PERSON> testified he had broken into <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>'s home at the orders of superiors. <PERSON> Riera </PERSON> <PERSON> Lunatti </PERSON> stated the armed forces were responsible for the operation, <PERSON> Rufino </PERSON> <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON> said. Judge <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON>, who issued the search warrant authorizing the break-in, also testified before the panel on Wednesday. <PERSON> Rufino </PERSON> <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON> said the commission planned to hear testimony from <PERSON> Ramualdo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bueso </PERSON>, interior and justice minister; Maj. <PERSON> Efrain </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON>, head of the government immigration department; Maj. <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON> <PERSON> Perdomo </PERSON>, director of aviation; and Col. <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, chief of a local police district. The chairman refused to rule out the possibility the panel could summon President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> to testify. `` We have begun a serious investigation into the affair because we consider that no functionary, be he military or civilian, is above Honduran laws,'' <PERSON> Rufino </PERSON> <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON> said. The government lifted the emergency decree and restored full constitutional guarantees at 6 a.m. Wednesday in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sula </LOCATION>, 125 miles to the north. Business, commerce and transportation operated normally. Five Hondurans died in the rioting last week. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, located in the same complex as the burned offices, was not damaged. Police detained at least 70 people believed involved in the attack, said Maj. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbina </PERSON>, chief police spokesman. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> is a staunch <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally, but some Hondurans protested the presence of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers in their country and joint U.S.-Honduran military exercises. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> was used as a base by U.S.-supported Contra rebels who fought the leftist Nicaraguan government until last month's signing of a cease-fire pact. Just before that agreement, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sent 3,200 soldiers to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> after Nicaraguan troops reportedly pursued Contras into Honduran territory.

<HEAD>PLO Seeks to Dismiss Action to Close U.N. Observer Mission</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge has refused one request to temporarily block legal action to close the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> observer mission. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmieri </PERSON> has scheduled an April 20 hearing on another request to block enforcement of the 1987 Anti-Terrorism Act. The law declared the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and its affiliates a terrorist organization. Meanwhile, lawyers for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> are seeking to dismiss a federal lawsuit that would force the closing of the mission. The government's lawsuit seeks a court order barring the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Zehdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Labib </PERSON> <PERSON> Terzi </PERSON>, head of the observer mission; and five other mission officials or employees from continuing to operate the mission or any other <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> office in this country. But <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> counsel <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney general, said in papers filed Monday at federal court that no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> court has jurisdiction to issue such an order because it would violate international law as well as the treaty setting up <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has yet to file a response. In a related matter, <PERSON> Palmieri </PERSON> refused on Tuesday to grant a preliminary injunction, blocking enforcement of the Anti-Terrorism Act. He ruled that a group of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens who say the act violates their First Amendment rights had shown insufficient proof they would suffer undue hardship or irreparable harm unless an injunction were granted. <PERSON> Palmieri </PERSON> has scheduled a hearing for later this month on another aspect of the lawsuit. <PERSON> Riyad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen and No. 2 official at the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> mission, said the law does not apply to him in his official capacity at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, or if it does it is unconstitutional.

<HEAD>Trial in Wrong County Starts Ethical, Legal Arguments</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The mistrial granted to a murder defendant whose case was prosecuted in the wrong county has triggered debate on whether he should go free, and on the ethics of his lawyer, who knew about the error but kept mum. `` All this guy's got going for him is me,'' public defender <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Joiner </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` If I've got to help the prosecutor, my God, he'd be better off without a lawyer.'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiefelbein </PERSON>, 38, was accused of fatally stabbing a man who invited him to dinner Christmas Eve 1986 at an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> home that purportedly straddles the line between <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> DeKalb </LOCATION> counties. The mistrial was granted April 6, the second day of his trial in <ORGANIZATION> Fulton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, when a prosecutor learned that the house actually is in <LOCATION> DeKalb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and that <PERSON> Joiner </PERSON> had known it all along. <PERSON> Joiner </PERSON> contends that his client should go free because a second prosecution, this time in <LOCATION> DeKalb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, would violate the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. `` It would be a miscarriage of justice if he were able to escape because of a problem like that,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, chief assistant district attorney in <LOCATION> DeKalb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where the state may press for a trial. Law officers in both counties assured prosecutors the house was in <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, said Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Finley </PERSON>, who learned the truth when she telephoned a witness after the first day of <PERSON> Schiefelbein </PERSON>'s trial. Ms. <PERSON> Finley </PERSON> said she was reviewing the next day's testimony with the owner of the house when `` he informed me that his house was in fact about two houses over the line in <LOCATION> DeKalb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>.'' The next day, <PERSON> Joiner </PERSON> said he had known of the mixup and Judge <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Etheridge </PERSON> declared a mistrial, telling <PERSON> Joiner </PERSON> he had `` wasted a lot of time and did your client absolutely no service whatever.'' <PERSON> Joiner </PERSON> said Wednesday it `` never even occurred to me'' to tell the judge earlier because ethics rules for lawyers require him to use any defense that is not frivolous. <PERSON> Joiner </PERSON> `` had an obligation not to say anything,'' said <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> professor of legal ethics and the main draftsman of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s model code of ethics. `` The defendant in a criminal case is permitted to require the state to go to its proof on every possible issue, and it's the state's responsibility to carry the burden in that respect,'' Hazard said. `` The defendant did nothing to mislead the prosecution, and I think -LRB- <PERSON> Joiner </PERSON> -RRB- did the right thing.'' <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> law professor <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> said legal codes of ethics discourage disclosures of information by defense lawyers but conflict with a lawyer's duties as an officer of the court. `` Frankly, I sympathize with the lawyer,'' said <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, a former dean of <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s law school. `` The courts have not given good guidance on this. They've waffled on the issue.'' <PERSON> Joiner </PERSON> says federal courts have held that part of a criminal case is proving it is being brought in the right court, so failure to prove that voids the entire prosecution. Another trial would be double jeopardy, he said. <PERSON> Etheridge </PERSON> disagreed with that argument, saying his court never really had jurisdiction over the case so `` anything we did would be a nullity.'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> DeKalb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutors already have found legal precedents supporting a retrial, but no decision will be made until the case file and the judge's order are received from <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Joiner </PERSON> also contends that there are factual issues in the case. He said victim <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadden </PERSON>, <PERSON> Schiefelbein </PERSON> and others in the house had been drinking, that no one thought <PERSON> Hadden </PERSON>'s wound was serious enough to summon help, and he might have died simply from a lack of medical attention. <PERSON> Schiefelbein </PERSON> also contends <PERSON> Hadden </PERSON> was choking him, he said.

 Passengers freed from a hijacked Kuwaiti jumbo jet said another gunman and a new supply of weapons came aboard the plane when it landed in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, its first stop after being seized last week. They also said the Shiite Moslem gunmen rigged the doors of the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 with explosives. One passenger who holds <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Egyptian citizenship said he kept the hijackers from discovering his American passport. Relatives, friends and <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s interior minister, greeted the 12 released hostages when they arrived at the airport in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> on Wednesday. The 12 were freed in <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> on Tuesday before the hijackers took the jet to <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, the third stop in the ordeal that began April 5. Thirty-two hostages remained aboard the jet, including three members of the extensive <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> royal family. They were held by about eight hijackers. Arab women ululated in celebration at the <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> airport while well-wishers pounded car roofs and shouted in joy as the 12 arrived. Aboard their plane were coffins containing the bodies of two Kuwaitis, who were beaten, shot then dumped from the hijacked jet onto the tarmac in <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>. The coffins _ draped in black, green and white <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> flags _ were carried to ambulances whose lights flashed on the dimly-lit runway. Those released included five Egyptians and three Jordanians in Western-style dress and four Kuwaitis wearing white robes and Arab headdresses. The director of <ORGANIZATION> Larnaca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Costas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallis </PERSON>, said the 12 men were `` physically all right, suffering mainly from fatigue.'' <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> <PERSON> Majiki </PERSON>, a Kuwaiti in his 60s, said the hijackers `` were six but in <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> they became seven.'' Kuwaiti news reports have quoted unidentified sources as saying at least one additional hijacker joined the plane in <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` They changed the crew, you know, their team,'' passenger <PERSON> Ramadan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show. `` One of them left ... and another two guys came over ... and they provided them with new weapons ... and bombs ... and ropes ... and explosives.'' <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, who holds <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Egyptian citzenship, said he hid his American passport in his briefcase. He said the hijackers asked passengers `` if somebody was stopping in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, or -LRB- was a -RRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen. I told them I ca n't afford it, you know it's very expensive to go to this country. `` I was scared ... very scared, because if they searched my briefcase you know I would be the first one to get shot,'' <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said. `` Minute-to-minute I ... was expecting -LRB- the hijacker -RRB-, you know, to grab me ... like -LRB- a -RRB- chicken from the chicken nest and kill me as he did, you know, those other two Kuwaiti guys,'' he said. Another freed hostage said the hijackers questioned their captives about what kind of lives they led. `` We were asked about our religion, and how many children we had, and about our work,'' said <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Malak </PERSON>, a Kuwaiti in his 30s. The hijackers had said they freed hostages who were poor or who had many children. `` I saw explosives tied to the doors,'' <PERSON> Malak </PERSON> said. `` I saw strings tied around the doors.'' The gunmen said repeatedly they were prepared to blow the plane up if 17 pro-Iranian Moslems jailed in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> on terrorism convictions were n't released. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> has refused. `` There were two handsome ones in their early 20s and two in their 30s,'' <PERSON> Malak </PERSON> said. An Egyptian, <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamdouh </PERSON> <PERSON> Badrawi </PERSON>, said the Koran, the Moslem holy book, helped him endure the ordeal. `` I feel as if I'm born again,'' he said. `` I read the entire Koran on the plane.'' <PERSON> Badrawi </PERSON> said scars on his hands were caused by a rope used to tie them up, but `` despite the cuffs I could turn the pages of the Koran. They -LRB- gunmen -RRB- liked that and patted my shoulder.'' <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayyid </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehan </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, said: `` They used to tell us, ` We will either all die together or live together.''' `` Yesterday, before they let us go, two hijackers appeared wearing napkins round their necks on which they had written, ` Martyrdom Is Our Love.''' <PERSON> Rehan </PERSON> said, `` I was hit on the face once when I locked the door of the toilet, something they told us not to do.'' But he said one gunman joked with the hostages and offered them cigarettes. <PERSON> Rehan </PERSON> said the more elderly hostages were treated kindly, and so were three members of the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> royal family _ <PERSON> Fadel </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>, a businessman in his 40s, and his sisters <PERSON> Ebtesam </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anware </PERSON>, who are in their 30s. `` The royals were treated very well, especially the women,'' he said. `` But their brother is the one who looks broken down psychologically.'' The released passengers were interviewed at the hospital or at the airport. The <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet was hijacked April 5 with 112 people aboard on a Bangkok-Kuwait flight and diverted to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. It flew to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> on Friday and then to <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> on Tuesday night.

<TEXT>
 A pilot held five years in Sandinista prisons said he was threatened with death and denied medical treatment as part of systematic psychological torture apparently directed by <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> intelligence agents. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Amador </PERSON>, 42, shot down during a Contra supply flight in 1983, was one of the first prisoners freed as part of last month's truce agreement between the Nicaraguan Resistance and the leftist Sandinista government He arrived here Saturday to join his wife and three children. <PERSON> Amador </PERSON> and other Contra officials said at a news conference here Wednesday they believe there are up to 12,000 political prisoners inside Nicaraguan jails despite government claims to the contrary. <PERSON> Amador </PERSON> said he had been threatened before leaving <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and told not to talk to reporters. `` They told me, ` If you make declarations to the press in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, we will put a bomb in your car in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> or anywhere else you go,''' said <PERSON> Amador </PERSON>. They reminded him of the assassination of former Nicaraguan dicator <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> after he fled the Sandinista revolution in 1979. <PERSON> Amador </PERSON>, 42, said at least three of the seven crew members on his doomed 1983 flight died in Sandinista hands even though all survived the crash of their plane, which he said was flying medicine, books and clothes to the rebels. When they were captured, some of the men were bound hand and foot and flown to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chipote </LOCATION> prison in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. `` We expected death at any minute,'' said <PERSON> Amador </PERSON>. `` They said they were going to kill us.'' Two crew members stayed behind and were never heard from again, and he later found a third was officially reported dead. At the prison, where he was kept in solitary confinement for 1 -LCB- years, <PERSON> Amador </PERSON> was regularly seated for 12 to 16 hours in a chair while he was threatened and interrogated. In the partially darkened room, he said, he could hear Cuban-accented men speaking Spanish and occasionally heard German, which he believed was spoken by East German advisers. Two Cuban exile Contra sympathizers still in prison in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> later told him they were being interrogated by Cuban G-2 intelligence agents, he said. He said he believes the Cubans were teaching their techniques to the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. `` They worked on the mind with constant death threats,'' said <PERSON> Amador </PERSON>. `` They told me if I did n't talk they would get my family in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, they would kill my children, and they would kill me.'' At one point they falsely claimed they were holding `` someone I loved,'' the pilot said. He said the guards held drills in which they would send soldiers to the door of each cell and point a Soviet-made rifle at the prisoners. `` They were waiting for an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> invasion,'' said <PERSON> Amador </PERSON>. `` They said as soon as the 82nd -LRB- Airborne Division -RRB- landed, we would be eliminated.'' <PERSON> Amador </PERSON> said he was told his family, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and the resistance had abandoned him. The pilot suffered what he later found out was a crushed disc during his crash landing, and was in constant pain, which his interrogators used against him, he said. `` They would open the cabinet and show me the medicine for my pain,'' he said. `` Then they would say, ` are you going to talk?''' He said he refused and was never given the pain-reliever. Doctors in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> later said his jailers had unintentionally helped him by forcing him to sleep on the floor, giving some relief to his back.

<TEXT>
 Share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> today closed above 27,000 points for the first time, while the dollar fell marginally against the Japanese yen in quiet trading. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 54.71-point winner Wednesday, reached a record high for the fifth time since last Thursday, adding another 125.80 points, or 0.46 percent, to finish the day at 27,111.35. Since the current upward trend began at the end of March, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> index surged by about 1,400 points. The market continued to be in a bullish mood, boosted by the agreement by the seven top industrialized nations to work together to keep the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> currency from falling further and by prospects for favorable <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures to be announced today in <LOCATION> Washigton </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Yoshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Shimoyama </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. In a two-page, joint communique issued Wednesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the finance ministers and central bank governors of the seven nations announced the extension of a Dec. 22 agreement in which they pledged to work together to keep the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency from falling further against the Japanese yen. Participating in the meeting were the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shimoyama </PERSON> said share prices were generally higher with construction and housing issues among the most popular. There was nothing to hold the market back and the major brokers were apparently determined to push the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> index through the 27,000 barrier, traders said. Volume of the first-section trade was a heavy 1.2 billion shares, up from 1 billion shares on Wednesday. Advancing issues outpaced decliners 504 to 375, while 185 issues were unchanged. On the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at 126.15 yen, down 0.30 from its close of 126.45 yen Wednesday. It had opened the day at 126.20 and ranged between 126.10-126 .43 yen `` The meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of the seven major nations did n't really affect trading, as the results were what had been expected,'' said <PERSON> Makoto </PERSON> <PERSON> Sato </PERSON> of the Bank of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> He said the market was rather quiet while awiting the announcement of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures today in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' huge trade deficit has affected the dollar's direction in recent months because the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has supported a lower dollar as a way of narrowing the gap

The backers of the drive delivered 21 bundles of petitions to the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, beating a 5 p.m. deadline by several hours and expressing confidence there would be enough valid signatures to support a new mayoral election. But late Wednesday <PERSON> Felicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Muftic </PERSON>, president of the election commission, said only 36,960 names were counted, short of the minimum 39,091 needed. The validity of the signatures was not checked. <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> reacted with pleasure, saying, `` To those people who opposed the recall, I thank you. To those people who supported the recall, I urge you to join with the city to help move the city forward. These are critical times and we can not afford to have any disunity.'' Critics, however, said the troubled city government will only be worse unless <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> gets the message and starts `` running things in a little better way,'' as city councilman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Swalm </PERSON> said. `` If he does n't, why you know I just think the city is going to be in very bad shape in a year or two. It's already in bad shape now, but it'll be worse,'' he said. <PERSON> Pena </PERSON>, 41, one of the first Hispanics to be mayor of a major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> city, was elected to his second term last June by 3,000 votes in a hotly disputed contest that required a runoff of top contenders. The recall drive was started by a group angered over what they claimed was fiscal mismanagement by the <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> administration. The group gathered supporters among a number of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> residents left stranded for several days by a major holiday snow storm. Maintenance crews plowed major traffic arteries, leaving side streets filled with snow for several days. At the time, <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> was vacationing out-of-state. The 39,091 votes needed for the recall represented 25 percent of the voters in the last mayoral election, said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarkington </PERSON>, executive director of the election commission.

<HEAD>KGB Chief Blames National Unrest On Education, Secret Services</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The head of the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> secret police blamed ethnic unrest that broke out in two southern republics and other areas of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on poor education and foreign secret services. <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON>'s speech on Wednesday in the <LOCATION> Volga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Cheboksary </LOCATION> was his first public comment on ethnic tensions in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> since rioting occurred in the <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> republic on Feb. 28. At least 32 people were killed in the rioting, 26 of them ethnic Armenians. Thousands of people began mass protests in neighboring <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> in mid-February to demand that the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> be annexed to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Three-quarters of the region's residents are ethnic Armenians, who traditionally are Christians. Azerbaijanis traditionally are Moslems. <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON> did not mention <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, but said `` anti-social actions of a nationalistic nature took place in a number of regions of this country,'' according to a report issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency. `` I believe that one of the major reasons for those anti-social actions is a serious negliect of the internationalist education of popular masses,'' <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON> was quoted as saying. He also blamed wrong approaches to solving social-economic problems, and said `` groundless notions'' about the problem-free development of relations between nationalities also played a part. The latter was an apparent reference to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s claims in the past to have solved the problem of relations among nationalities Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said at a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting in February that the problem is one of the country's most serious, and that the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will devote an upcoming meeting to it. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, a country of more than 100 ethnic groups, tries to teach citizens to de-emphasize nationalistic feelings in favor of what is termed a spirit of friendship and equality with other ethnic groups. But ethnic groups often resent domination by Russians and other Slavs, and ages-old tensions exist among some of the ethnic groups. <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON> also said that foreign secret service organizations that he did not identify played a part in stirring up ethnic tensions. `` It is an open secrety that secret services of imperalist powers and foreign anti-Soviet centers actively join extremist nationalistic actions,'' he said. `` Later on they start playing the part of open instigators of hostile actions aimed at kindling hostility among nations,'' <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON> said. `` One should not underestimate the danger of this method of subversive actions against this country. However, in my opinion, the main attention should be concentrated on a timely solution of the emerging socio-economic problems, on the education in patriotic and internationalist spirit,'' he said. In a televised speech in September, <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON> accused the West of trying to undermine Soviet economic reforms and sow discord among nationalities. Besides the tensions in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, there also has been an increase in nationalist activities in the Baltic republics of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>, and among Crimean Tatars who were deported from their homeland by <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> because of alleged cooperation with Nazi invaders in World War II.

<TEXT>
 Rush hour traffic came to a two-minute standstill today as the wail of air raid sirens opened <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s annual memorial day for the 6 million European Jews slain by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> in World War II The nation's radio stations played melancholy tunes throughout the day. Restaurants and houses of entertainment were shut by law for 24 hours ending at sundown today. More than 100 memorial ceremonies were scheduled throughout the country. Holocaust Day, officially called Martyrs and Heroes Remembrance Day, is commemorated on the anniversary of the start of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Ghetto uprising of 1943, when Polish Jews used pistols to fight Nazis in tanks. This year, the commemoration comes amidst a four-month spate of anti-Israeli violence in the occupied territories that has claimed the lives of 144 Palestinians and two Israelis. The conflict played a prominent role in an emotional speech given by Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> at a memorial ceremony at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s Yad Vashem monument Wednesday night. `` We again face the phenomenon of eternal hatred for the eternal people ... When will the nations learn that they can never overcome us and decide to leave us alone,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said. `` Even today when we dwell in our own land, evil-hearted and unfeeling people shoot poison arrows at our youngsters and they wander the countryside, turning it into a valley of death,'' he added. His statement was seen as an allusion to the killing of a teen-aged Jewish settler during a clash in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION> last week as well as other attacks against Israelis in the occupied areas. A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would seek clarifications from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> today about reports a government spokesman in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> criticized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s tactics in the occupied territories and linked it to the Holocaust. The Polish spokesman, <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON>, said on Tuesday at a news conference that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s `` brutal behavior'' was an `` offense to the memory'' of the defenders of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Ghetto. Despite the controversy, 2,000 Israelis, including teen-agers, two Cabinet ministers and six legislators, flew to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> this week for observances of the 45th anniversary of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Ghetto revolt, which took a month to crush. Although the generation of Holocaust survivors has dwindled in numbers, interest in the tragedy has been rekindled in young Israelis in part because of the war crimes trial of retired <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> autoworker <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, which was televised nationwide. Judges are expected to issue a verdict next week. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> is accused of operating the gas chambers at the <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> death camp in Nazi-occupied <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, where 850,000 Jews perished. He claims he is a victim of mistaken identity. The renewed interest in the Holocaust was dramatized by a well-attended concert Wednesday night staged by two popular rock singers, <PERSON> Shlomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Artzi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yehuda </PERSON> <PERSON> Policker </PERSON>, whose parents survived concentration camps. <PERSON> Policker </PERSON>'s new album, `` The Stop for <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION>,'' is about the trains used to ship Jews to the death camps. In an editorial, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamishmar </PERSON> daily wrote: `` This year's Holocaust Day distances us another year from those days of horror but does not weaken their memory. `` Survivors' children have absorbed the memory of the terror and loss. It inhabits the world of every Israeli and has become an inseparable part of the nation's memory and mission.''

 The right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> said it will appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> a decision denying its request for a recount of votes for a disputed assembly seat. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday turned down the party's request for a new vote tally in <LOCATION> eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> province. The council said in a statement the demand was `` inappropriate.'' The decision effectively denied the party, known as <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, a majority in the new legislative assembly. <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>'s president, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, said his party would appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to reverse the council decision. He said the panel's ruling `` was no surprise.'' `` It was difficult to hope for a response favorable to us when the accused is also the judge,'' he said in a telephone interview. Arena contends its candidates won 31 of the 60 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> during nationwide elections March 20. Final election results announced last week by the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> gave <ORGANIZATION> Arena </ORGANIZATION> 30 seats, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> 23 and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conciliation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> seven. The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> had held a majority before the election. <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> claims the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conciliation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conspired with the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> to commit fraud. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conciliation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members have indicated they will align with the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> to form a voting bloc in the assembly. The results could produce a legislative deadlock during <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s final year in office. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> could delay ruling on <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>'s appeal for many months, effectively putting an end to the dispute by inaction. All parties have agreed the dispute will not prevent the installation of the new assembly May 1, with the composition announced by the council.

 A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> health official who visited <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupied territories said today that <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> are suffering abdominal pain, miscarriages and muscular weakness from tear gas <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is using against them. Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiddlestone </PERSON>, U.N. Relief and <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> director of health affairs, said in a telephone interview that he saw Palestinians experiencing symptoms `` which were not those usually associated with tear gas.'' But he added: `` I'm not actually accusing anybody of anything.'' The agency said the gas was being used improperly. The Israeli army denied the charge. Agency spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> reported several cases in which tear gas had been thrown into closed areas, houses, schools and a clinic in Israeli-held territory. `` It says right on the canisters that it must not be used in a confined area. So it -LRB- the gas -RRB- has particular toxic effects when it is thrown into a room,'' he said. `` One label says: ` For outdoor use only. Contents may cause severe injury if not used in accordance with this warning instruction.''' In the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, agency spokeswoman <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Debaigh </PERSON> said a 70-year-old woman, <PERSON> Wadfah </PERSON> <PERSON> Farraj </PERSON> <PERSON> Allah </PERSON>, was dead on arrival at <LOCATION> Jabaliya </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> clinic on Wednesday after troops hurled a tear gas canister into her home. <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> officials said Mrs. <PERSON> Allah </PERSON> suffocated after inhaling the gas. An army spokesman denied the account and said that `` results of an autopsy carried out by the -LRB- government-run -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Pathological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kabir </PERSON> showed the woman died of natural causes.'' <ORGANIZATION> UNRWA </ORGANIZATION> is providing shelter, education and medical assistance to Palestinian refugees living in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` I am a physician and my worry is that people are having other symptoms than normal tear gas symptoms,'' <PERSON> Hiddlestone </PERSON> said. `` We need to know what's being used in the hope we can do more for these people because the abdominal pain is extremely severe of women who have been miscarrying and have had premature labor,'' he said. The doctor said he also met people suffering from `` great muscular weakness'' after exposure to gas used by the Israelis. He said those ailments occurred without eye, nose or throat irritation, `` so that even though you have tear gas which is in improper concentrations when it's put into closed spaces, the symptomatology of some people is not that which is normal as a result of tear gas.'' An army spokesman said: `` There is no truth to the report we are using a new type of toxic gas. The purpose of tear gas is to limit casualties and to cause as little damage as possible by avoiding physical confrontation with the rioters.'' He said tear gas could be lethal if inhaled by people already suffering from heart or other health problems, or if used in a small enclosed space. `` The army does not use tear gas in small enclosed spaces, at least not on purpose,'' said the spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The Boston-based Physicians for Human Rights has expressed concern that the Israelis may be misusing tear gas. The <ORGANIZATION> American-Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Discrimination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a lobbying group, contends that more than 30 people have died in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> from exposure to tear gas.

 Fire raged out of control for eight hours along the <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> waterfront, shooting flames 100 feet into the air and filling the sky with thick, black smoke. Three businesses were destroyed. More than 200 firefighters battled the intense heat and flames of the seven-alarm blaze, which was not brought under control until 6:30 a.m. today. Five firefighters suffered minor injuries. The fire was discovered about 10:30 p.m. Wednesday at an automotive lubricant company, and arson was suspected, said Fire Department spokesman Capt. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>. `` It's a very hot fire,'' <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said during the night battle. The solvents and motor oils `` added a lot of fuel to the fire. The troubling thing about this, you do n't know what's going to happen next.'' The fire threatened the vacant Allied Chemical plant, but did not reach the building. Fire officials had been afraid the heat would trigger an explosion there. The fire apparently began at <ORGANIZATION> Autoline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lubricants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and sent 55-gallon drums of oil and lubricants rocketing into the sky. It spread to <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lumber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, then engulfed <LOCATION> Lacy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Foundries </LOCATION>. `` It looked like the world was on fire,'' said <PERSON> Meg </PERSON> <PERSON> Craft </PERSON>, 36, who was awakened when an explosion shook her home. The area lies on a peninsula across the water from the <LOCATION> Inner </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> and a few blocks from the historic Fells Point area. The flames soared 100 feet into the air and could be seen for several miles, drawing Fells Point residents into the streets to watch. Dense, black clouds of smoke hung over the area. The fire went to seven alarms within a half-hour, <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said. Firefighters stood poised on hydraulic booms, aiming their hoses down onto the blaze, while others manned fireboats in the harbor. Autoline President <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, 46, and executive vice president <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, 45, watched somberly. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said the company had about $ 1.2 million in inventory. Autoline receptionist <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Nowicki </PERSON>, 33, was near tears. `` It's terrible, it's awful, My heart just aches for them,'' she said of <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> `` They're watching everything they owned go up in smoke. They worked so hard, they do n't deserve this.'' `` I'm in no condition to talk,'' said <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mill </ORGANIZATION> and Lumber. `` I'm in shock.''

<HEAD>Study: Prison Population, Already at Capacity, to Grow 21 Percent

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

 Get-tough criminal laws may satisfy public opinion, but they are failing to cut crime rates and are forcing prison officials to cope with even more prison crowding, a new study concludes. `` The prison route, the idea that we ought to send everybody to prison and keep them there, just does n't work,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Crime and Delinquency. `` In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, for instance, the number of inmates has tripled since 1977, and the crime rate has not dropped 1 percent,'' he said Wednesday. The mandatory sentencing laws _ so-called `` get-tough'' measures _ will play a key role in the projected 21 percent increase in the nation's prison population by 1992, said <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, director of research for the San Francisco-based criminal-justice think tank. The study, based on the crime and incarceration rates for nine states, projects a 30 percent increase in parolees over the same five-year period. The nine states studied were <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Again using <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> as an example, <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said its current inmate population of 69,000 could almost double to 125,000 within 10 years. `` I'm not saying it's going to happen,'' he said, `` but it certainly could happen if we keep the current policies intact.'' <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said the money for prisons is siphoning off funds that could be used for other human services _ medical, education and welfare _ that eventually might make a dent in prison population growth. `` The generation we need to be concerned about is not the one in prison right now, but the kids who are 10, 11 and 12 years,'' <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said at a news conference. The most immediate solution to crowding is early-release programs for prisoners not in maximum security, he said. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said the average prison term is two years, and simply trimming three months from each would provide significant relief, `` especially since studies have shown us that releasing these people early does n't drive up the -LRB- crime -RRB- rate.'' The new study also highlighted several problems correctional officials likely will face in the future, including an aging inmate population requiring expensive medical services and an increasing number of black and Hispanic males in prison.

<HEAD>President Says Explosion At Ammunition Dump Was Sabotage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> said today that sabotage caused an explosion at an ammunition dump that killed at least 96 people. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> also denied that the weapons in the dump were intended for guerrillas fighting the government of neighboring <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` My personal assessment is that it could n't be anything but a very effective way of sabotage,'' <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> told reporters at an informal briefing at the presidential place. `` Somebody who is not in line with us,'' was responsible, he said. The president would not elaborate, citing the ongoing investigation into Sunday's blast at the ammunition depot between <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rawalpindi </LOCATION>. The latest death toll stands at 96, but officials said scores of people were still missing. More than 1,000 were reported injured by the explosion, which send rockets flying into the cities. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> said the depot was used only by the army of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and that none of the weapons was destined for the Afghan guerrillas, who have headquarters in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The guerrillas receive foreign military aid, inlcuding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms, through <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Eyewitnesses said that after the explosion and fire, they saw burning trucks with Afghan license plates near the dump. Moslem guerrillas have been at war with the Afghan government for 10 years, since a communist coup installed a government friendly to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Father Awarded Custody Of Contractually Conceived Twins</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The mother of 7-month-old twins conceived under contract has agreed to relinquish custody of the children to their father and avoid a court battle. <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> decided to let <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Glinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Huber </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jonesboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, have permanent custody of the twins, lawyer <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>, who represented the <ORGANIZATION> Hubers </ORGANIZATION>, said. `` It was probably the ultimate act of love on <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>' part,'' attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> MacAlpine </PERSON>, who negotiated the settlement for the <ORGANIZATION> Yateses </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday `` They realized that in their precarious financial condition they could never provide the kind of home for the twins that the <ORGANIZATION> Hubers </ORGANIZATION> could,'' he said. Both <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Ithaca </LOCATION>, are unemployed. <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Keane </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION> attorney who arranged the contract that led to the twins' birth, said he believed the babies `` ended up where they should and where I think would be obviously in their best interest.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Hubers </ORGANIZATION> paid <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> $ 10,000 for matching them up with Mrs. <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> and arranging for her to be inseminated with <PERSON> Huber </PERSON>'s sperm. There was no payment to Mrs. <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>, <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> and <PERSON> MacAlpine </PERSON> said. The custody agreement was approved late Tuesday by Circuit Judge <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, who voided the surrogate parenting contract last January, calling it unenforceable and contrary to public policy. A trial to determine which couple should be awarded custody was scheduled to begin next week. Under the agreement, the birth certificates of the children, born Sept. 4, 1987, will be changed to give them the surname of <PERSON> Huber </PERSON>, <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> and <PERSON> MacAlpine </PERSON> said. Their first names will remain <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, <PERSON> MacAlpine </PERSON> said. The Yates couple's decision was influenced in part by reports of a psychologist and psychiatrist who both concluded the <ORGANIZATION> Hubers </ORGANIZATION> were the better choice to raise the twins, according to <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogler </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Yateses </ORGANIZATION>' attorney. Briefs filed in the case showed that Mrs. <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> once pleaded guilty to receiving stolen property and that her husband was twice convicted for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol. In contrast, the <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> farm couple was portrayed as `` stable, loving and hardworking ... with no history of criminal activity or drug or alcohol abuse.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>, who filed her custody suit before the twins were born, has actively supported a drive to outlaw commercial surrogacy, appearing at news conferences, testifying before legislative committees, telling her story on television interview shows. Good Housekeeping magazine paid $ 25,000 to Mrs. <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>' legal defense fund for rights to her story. Under the terms of the court order, part of that money will be used to reimburse the state for the cost of the twins' delivery, which was paid through the Medicaid program.

<HEAD>Convicted Ex-Reagan Aide Still Proclaims Innocence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former White House political director <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> said today he felt `` a total lack of remorse'' as he continued to claim innocence despite his recent conviction for illegally lobbying his former government colleagues on behalf of the scandal-ridden <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and others. `` You have to be guilty before you can feel remorse. I do not think I'm guilty,'' <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> said in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America. `` If you want me to go out and grovel in order to avoid this kind of a sentence, I'm going to get the sentence,'' said <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>. Last week he was given a 90-day prison sentence and fined $ 30,000 for three counts of illegally lobbying then-presidential counselor <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and other White House aides. When he was sentenced, <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> charged that prosecutor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> was `` out to get'' him `` because I would not cop a plea and because I would not say I was remorseful.'' `` We were not allowed to plead that we had advice of counsel,'' <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> said today. `` We did talk to lawyers.'' <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, 63, also repeated his criticism of the ethics statute, saying, `` We also find the law very vague. We think it's unconstitutionally vague It does n't really tell you what you can do and what you ca n't do.'' <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> said he does think there should be some kind of ethics law applicable to former government employees but it should not interfere with constitutional rights. The former White House aide charged that the current law tells you `` you ca n't do what the Constitution tells you you can do.'' <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> was asked whether he thought President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has been hurt by the cases of former aides being accused and convicted of violating laws in connection with their service in his administration. <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, a longtime <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> friend, said, `` Most of the people who have gotten in so-called trouble, it's been after they got out. ... I do n't know why anybody should blame the president for things that have happened to people after they left the White House.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> today declined to establish a new clean air standard to protect asthmatics from peak exposures to sulfur dioxide that might last only a few minutes. Those exposures might occur around sources that meet all current standards based on longer measurement times, sources like coal-burning power plants, smelters and factory boilers. A burst of emissions from a plant, or even rare wind patterns, might cause people living nearby to face high concentrations briefly. Environmentalists denounced the decision embodied in a draft affirmation of current standards. `` There is a whole slew of evidence'' accumulated since 1980 that many asthmatics are not being protected by current standards, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Doniger </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, claiming that `` for this administration the wishes of the utility industry always come first.'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Yuhnke </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> said his organization would try to get a court to order a short-term standard established. At the <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the principal trade association for utilities, spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s decision `` reflects a careful weighing of all the scientific evidence. She said current standards reduced average sulfur dioxide concentrations by 37 percent between 1977 and 1986. The institute has said a stringent short-term standard could be as costly as an acid rain control program, perhaps $ 5 billion a year. Sulfur dioxide is the major raw material for acid rain, but acid rain is not an issue in <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s decision about ground-level concentrations of sulfur dioxide. According to <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement, new studies have found `` measurable changes in respiratory function and symptomatic effects _ shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing _ in asthmatics exposed for short periods, five to 10 minutes up to one hour, to 0.4 parts per million of sulfur dioxide or more.'' But it said `` these response occurred predominantly in subjects who were exercising and not using preventive medication at the time.'' It added that the effects `` appear to be transient and reversible and, at lower concentrations, are similar to those most asthmatics typically experience from exercise or other stimuli, for example, cold air.'' These effects are not like an `` asthma attack,'' and asthmatics on medication `` will likely not experience a response'' to a short-term peak, the agency said. <PERSON> Doniger </PERSON> said: `` I do n't know of any responsible group of scientists that takes that position. The -LRB- agency -RRB- argument is, just because there are other things that make asthmatics ill, it's OK for power plants to make asthmatics ill.'' Only about 1 percent of the national population of asthmatics, estimated by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> as 30 million people, would be exposed to short-term peaks, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said

 Nation of Islam leader <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> urged cheering students at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> to support <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for president. Outside, other students protested <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>'s on-campus lecture. `` <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is running to save a people, he is running to save the nation,'' said <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>, who endorsed the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> minister four years ago and campaigned with him. <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> has not been involved in the 1988 <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign. `` I do n't care if he -LRB- <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> -RRB- rejects me,'' said <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> who told reporters at an earlier news conference Wednesday the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> contender `` does not want my help, nor needs my support.'' `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is growing up to respect men of wisdom in black skins,'' <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> told the mixed black and white crowd of 2,000, most of whom stood and applauded. `` You should thank God <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has emerged.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> accepted <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>'s endorsement in 1984 and refused to denounce some of <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>'s anti-white, anti-Jewish statements. <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> was quoted as praising <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and calling Judaism a `` gutter religion.'' The counter-demonstration on the sidewalks outside <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Irvine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auditorium </ORGANIZATION> attracted a crowd which police estimated at 1,000 but which university leaders said was no more than 400. It preceded a memorial service held nearby commemorating the Holocaust in which 6 million Jews were exterminated during World War II by <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. At the anti-Farrakhan rally, speakers denounced the <PERSON> Muslim </PERSON> leader for what they said was his anti-Semitic, anti-white rhetoric and called on students to denounce the remarks. Students held signs saying: `` Unity, Yes. Anti-Semitism, No.'' and `` Free Speech, Yes. Hatred, No.'' `` No matter what <PERSON> Farrahkan </PERSON> says, it does n't erase what he said in the past,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemulka </PERSON>, the rally organizer and chairman of the Council of Jewish Students. `` We must work together as a community instead of being at odds.'' Last week, university officials refused a Jewish group's request to cancel the visit, saying they respected <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>'s right to free speech. A letter condemning <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> and signed by more than 700 students and teachers appeared in the student paper Wednesday. University President <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackney </PERSON> defended the <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> visit, insisting that `` in an academic community, open expression is the most fundamental value. We ca n't have free speech just some of the time for some of the people.'' <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> spoke for more than two hours. He called <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` a racist, white society.'' He claimed the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was assassinated `` with the express consent of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. government.'' `` How can I ask black people to fight for this country that do n't give a damn for us?'' he asked. Cheers roared from a crowd of 2,000 who had to pass through electronic metal detectors to enter the auditorium. The university spent about $ 6,000 in additional security for the lecture. He predicted that `` in less than 100 years blacks will equal the number of whites in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and we wo n't have to ask, ` Will there be a black in the White House?''' He also denied he was an anti-Semite, had denigrated Judaism, or had boasted about the greatness of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>, despite his negative comments about Jews in the past and during the speech. It was these charges, he said, that Jews are repeating in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which will hold a presidential primary next week. `` They are using me in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to try to derail <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> was paid $ 10,000 plus travel expenses by the two groups sponsoring the appearance: the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consciousness </ORGANIZATION> and the predominantly white <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>.

 Palestinians staged a general strike across the occupied territories today to protest mass arrests of Arabs. Hospital officials said one Arab protester was killed and two wounded in clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. The strike, ordered by the PLO-affiliated underground leadership, was to support 4,800 Palestinians detained by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops since an Arab uprising was launched last December. Most of the 110,000 Palestinians with jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> did n't show up for work. Arab shopowners closed their doors in the cities of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. Since Dec. 8, 144 Palestinians and two Israelis have been killed in anti-occupation unrest in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures. Protests broke out today in two refugee camps in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and two cities in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> media reports. <PERSON> Wael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Asmar </PERSON>, 24, was shot in the heart and died at <LOCATION> Al </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ittihad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, an emergency room official told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The two wounded were identified as 12-year-old <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuad </PERSON> <PERSON> Taha </PERSON>, who lost his right eye after being hit by a rubber bullet in <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Rebhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shihada </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehan </PERSON>, 17, who was in critical conditon with a bullet wound in the stomach, said an official at <LOCATION> Rafidiyeh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. The army denied allegations that soldiers were using tear gas improperly against Palestinians or using a particularly toxic form of the gas. `` There is absolutely no truth to the report we are using a new type of toxic gas. The Israeli army does not use any toxic gases in dealing with Palestinian demonstrators,'' said an army spokesman, who in keeping with regulations, spoke on condition of anonymity. Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiddlestone </PERSON>, director of health affairs for the U.N. <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said today that Palestinians are suffering abdominal pain, miscarriages and muscular weakness from tear gas. He said the symptoms are not usually associated with the gas. The director of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Yoram </PERSON> <PERSON> Ettinger </PERSON>, said he plans to bar Palestinians from distributing press releases to foreign journalists in their mailboxes at the press office. `` Being committed to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> they should n't expect <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, whom the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> wants to destroy, to facilitate their dissemination of information,'' <PERSON> Ettinger </PERSON> told the English-language <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> daily. <PERSON> Ettinger </PERSON>'s plans were protested by the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. On Wednesday, soldiers arrested 70 Palestinians in a raid on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Salfit </LOCATION>, whose residents had rejected Israeli authority and set up their own government, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> media reported. <LOCATION> Salfit </LOCATION>, 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, became a symbol of an organized liberated town, a model of quiet civil disobedience, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> media reports said, and the army feared the model would be adopted by other communities. The village was headed by a committee of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members and representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> branch that had provided community services for 6,000 residents and created a system of guards, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> said Residents were barred from painting anti-Israeli slogans or erecting roadblocks. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> media reported as many as 70 people were arrested. The army put the number of detainees at `` several dozen.'' The television showed many of the men, blindfolded with white rags, sitting on the ground on a village street. At the Lebanese border, troops killed three <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas who tried to enter <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> before dawn on Wednesday on a hostage-taking mission. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, soldiers wounded 53 Arabs in a refugee camp with metal bullets, rubber bullets, tear gas and beatings, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> and hospital officials said. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> activists punished Palestinian merchants defying <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> orders to open their stores only for three hours in the morning. The activists firebombed a money-changer's shop in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and set fire to stalls at a produce market in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, police and witnesses said.

<HEAD>Business Inventories Rose 0.1 Percent in February</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Business inventories rose a slight 0.1 percent in February, much slower than the pace in recent months, the government said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the gain in inventories pushed them up by $ 825 million during February to a seasonally adjusted $ 715.9 billion. The inventory gan came as total business sales were climbing 0.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 468.3 billion in February, reversing a 0.5 percent decline in January. The February gain in inventories held on shelves and backlots followed a 0.7 percent gain in January. The February rise was held back by a 1.1 percent fall in inventories held by retailers. This decrease reflected primarily a 5.2 percent drop in the backlog of unsold cars. Analysts had worried that the rise in unsold inventories late in 1987 and in January would force production cutbacks and weak economic growth in the early part of 1988. But recently economists have modified their views, contending that the slowdown in growth in the early part of this year will not be as severe as they had first feared. The 1.1 percent decline in inventories held at the retail level was accompanied by increases of 0.9 percent in inventories held at the wholesale level and 0.5 percent in inventories held by manufacturers. The 0.6 percent overall sales rise was led by a 1.2 percent increase in wholesale sales in February, a 0.6 percent rise in sales by retailers and a 0.1 percent rise in sales by manufacturers. In an advance report on Wednesday, the government said retail sales increased 0.8 percent in March. The combination of rising sales and slightly rising inventories pushed the inventory to sales ratio down from 1.54 in January to 1.53 in February. That means it would take 1.53 months to exhaust inventories at the February sales pace. That ratio is not considered abnormally high.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> said today that he foresees more bloodshed in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> because an accord to end Soviet military involvement there does not address the issue of a new Afghan government. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> said that as long as the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government remains in power and the guerrillas fight to overthrow it, the war will continue and an estimated 5 million Afghan refugees will not be able to return home safely. `` I see trouble and turmoil in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> through the insurgency, through the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> trying to achieve their objective to overthrow this regime and establish their own authority, and that will mean more loss of life,'' <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> told reporters at an informal news briefing. `` That will mean insurgency in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> will not stop unless the Afghan <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> have achieved their end.'' When asked why <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> agreed to sign the accord in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> today, <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> cited the provision calling for the withdrawal of Soviet troops backing the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which borders <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and hosts about 3 million of the 5 million Afghan refugees, represented the rebels in the talks. He said the withdrawal `` made the task of the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> less strenuous,'' implying that it would be easier for the guerrillas to overthrow the communist regime. `` Once they're -LRB- Soviets -RRB- withdrawn, the logical conclusion ... -LRB- is -RRB- that it will be a little difficult for the present regime to stand for a longer period,'' <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> said. The accord signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> does not guarantee the end of the 10-year-old war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, but it calls for the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops to begin leaving the country by May 15. It does not address the issue of an interim government to replace the one in power now. The guerrillas have said they will continue fighting until the government is deposed. In addition to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> signed the agreement. The civil war began 10 years ago after a communist coup installed a government friendly to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Red Army troops intervened in December 1979.

<TEXT>
 A fierce northeaster pounded the mid-Atlantic coast with heavy rains, winds near hurricane strength and waves that covered highways, toppled at least two houses into the sea and threatened the only bridge to <LOCATION> Hatteras </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The storm bore down hardest on <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, where whipped sea foam covered beaches like a blanket of snow. Winds gusted up to 70 mph and waves crested at nearly 25 feet off <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hatteras </LOCATION>. No serious injuries were reported. Forecasters were uncertain how long the storm would linger off the coast, meteorologist <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Severe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Storms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forecast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, said today. In <LOCATION> Sandbridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON> said his $ 200,000 oceanfront home tumbled into the surf, and officials said about 20 other homes were threatened by high water and pounding surf. `` My house is in the ocean. It's finished,'' <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON> said Wednesday night. `` I'm heartsick.'' About 5,000 people, mostly in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, temporarily lost electricity in the storm, which also tore up roads and washed out trees, road signs and utility poles and toppled portions of at least four houses. Tides rose to their highest level in six years, officials said. By this morning, the storm was far enough off the coast for winds to die down, and residents began cleaning up the tons of debris from their scoured beaches. The northeaster, which takes its name from the prevailing wind direction during the storm, pushes tides to abnormal heights, eroding beaches and turning storm drains into geysers. `` The wind literally forces the water up against the coast,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, meteorologist in charge of the <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Flood warnings also were issued for the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> coasts. In <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, police reported minor flooding. Police spokesman <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> said the water was very high, and it was difficult to say how much beach has eroded until the water goes down. No beachfront properties were damaged, however. At least one cottage in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> fell into the ocean, and state Highway 12 was closed late Wednesday, stranding some Outer Banks residents in the town of <LOCATION> Manteo </LOCATION> overnight, said T.C. McKimmey, of the Dare County Sheriff's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` The cottage already had suffered severe erosion and had been leaning last spring, but the storm took the final toll,'' <PERSON> McKimmey </PERSON> said. Several other houses also were threatened by waters that rolled over the beach road in <LOCATION> Nags </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Head </LOCATION>. Heavy surf washed away about 100 feet of sand from the south side of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inlet </LOCATION>, threatening to damage the approach to the <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> Bridge that leads to <LOCATION> Hatteras </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, about 20 miles off the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> coast. Further erosion could wash away much of the sand from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, exposing the bridge and approach to direct waves, highway officials said. `` That point is the protection for our south bridge abutment,'' state Highway Administrator <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said. `` The ocean is eating away rapidly at that point.'' Aides said Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> planned to fly to the coast today with highway officials to survey the damage. At <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, heavy rain and wind caused erosion almost as fast as a dredge pumped sand in a $ 1.4 million beach replenishment project. `` We're losing sand fast due to this inclement weather,'' Town Manager <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrell </PERSON> said. `` It happened almost overnight, but there's nothing you can do about it. I do n't know how much is being lost in dollar figures.'' In <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, the Downtown Tunnel between <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION> was closed for three hours Wednesday as water in the tube rose as high as 7 inches. The flooding was caused by water that poured into an electrical junction box left uncapped by construction workers, state <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanke </PERSON> said. `` It was a combination of freak occurrences that will never happen again in a million years,'' <PERSON> Hanke </PERSON> said.

 A terrorism task force is investigating a Japanese national arrested on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turnpike </LOCATION> with three homemade bombs, each powerful enough to destroy a building, authorities said. The suspect was identified by <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> police today as <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>, 35, a former bookstore owner who was extradited to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> two years ago on charges of illegal possession of explosives. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, acting <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Koichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Haraguchi </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> `` has a strong suspicion that he -LRB- Kikumura -RRB- might have a relationship with the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>,'' a terrorist group that gained notoriety for a series of attacks abroad in the 1970s. However, Japanese police `` have n't made a final conclusion that he is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Haraguchi </PERSON> told a news conference. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> news service in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>'s arrest had raised suspicions the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> might be planning attacks during the summit of leaders of advanced industrial nations June 19 in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The task force was formed by state police and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents in response to concerns about the sophistication of the bombs found in the suspect's car, and `` inquiries from overseas,'' state police Superintendent <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Pagano </PERSON> said at a news conference Wednesday. `` The material was loaded and charged and ready to use,'' <PERSON> Pagano </PERSON> said. `` It was intended to injure people.'' <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> was arrested Tuesday at a Turnpike rest stop after a state trooper noticed him acting oddly, stopped his car and found explosive devices and three homemade bombs resembling fire extinguishers in his car. The suspect was carrying a stolen Japanese passport and international driver's license. The man named on the passport and license, <PERSON> Masatoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kishizono </PERSON>, had reported his passport was missing, <PERSON> Pagano </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> was charged with possession of explosive devices and possession of explosives. State police experts who defused the bombs say each of the devices contained enough power to destroy a building. A bail hearing was scheduled this afternoon in Superior Court for the suspect, who was being held at the <LOCATION> Bergen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pagano </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGinley </PERSON>, special agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> office, told the news conference they would not speculate on where the suspect was headed or what he planned to do with the bombs. During a hearing Wednesday, <LOCATION> Bergen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Assistant Prosecutor <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> told Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> DiGisi </PERSON> that authorities were unable to identify the suspect. The address he had given <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigration officials upon entering the country May 8, 1987, turned out to be that of an unoccupied <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> apartment, police said. Also, the man had indicated he did not understand questions posed in English, although he had spoken in clear English to the trooper who arrested him, Ms. <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> said. Japanese police said <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>, a dropout of <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, was deported to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> in August 1986, three months after police at a local airport found 2.2 pounds of dynamite in his luggage. He was acquitted of the Dutch charges in a Japanese court later in 1986 and dropped out of sight, police said. The Japanese police spokesman refused comment on news reports that authorities believed Kikumura established links to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a Japanese terrorist group, in 1974 when he ran a bookshop in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> was a radical splinter faction of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION>, which claimed support from 850,000 of the nation's 1.3 million college students in the 1960s. After gaining notoriety from a series of terrorist activities abroad in the 1970s, including the attack on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ben-Gurion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in which 28 people were killed, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has been relatively silent in recent years.

<TEXT>
 Director <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON> defended his new film `` Colors,'' a gritty street-gang drama, as a story told from a police viewpoint, while a downtown theater scratched the movie for fear it would spark violence. The film, scheduled for release Friday, used active <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> gang members as extras and advisers as well as the actual identifying colors of blue for the Crips and red for the Bloods gangs. `` Colors'' has drawn criticism from police, city officials and community leaders who claim it glorifies the violent youth gangs that have been plaguing the city. Outside a private, celebrity screening Wednesday night, 10 <ORGANIZATION> Guardian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> chanted `` Do n't Show ` Colors''' while <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON> defended the film starring <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON> as gang-fighting police officers. The Guardian Angels claims that `` Colors'' glamorizes the street-gang lifestyle and wants distribution of the film halted or some of its proceeds donated to community organizations that combat gang violence. `` There is nothing in this film that glorifies being in a gang,'' <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON> said, adding that the film is told from a police viewpoint. `` I do n't know how people can twist it around and say I'm glorifying gangs.'' At the celebrity screening, the movie's producer, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solo </PERSON>, called the protests misguided. `` I think the people who are making those predictions are whipping up the probability and the possibility,'' of violence, the producer said. `` The people who are saying blood is going to flow in the streets are asking for blood to flow in the streets. I think it's very irresponsible behavior.'' Attending the VIP screening were Best Actress Oscar-winner <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>, and last year's winner <PERSON> Marlee </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` McGyver,'' U-2's <PERSON> Bono </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewson </PERSON> and actor-director <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Estevez </PERSON>. The downtown Laemmle Grand, adjoining the posh Sheraton Grand Hotel, decided not to show the film because its staff feared a reaction from nearby gangs. `` The staff at the theater were in a panic because the home turf of one of the gangs in the movie is just a couple of miles from downtown,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Laemmle </PERSON>, co-owner of the theater chain. About 70 theaters in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area plan to show the movie. The Beverly Hills-Hollywood chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assocition </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> joined police and city leaders who objected to the film premiering in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> during a period of heightened public concern about gang violence. More than 85 people have been killed so far this year in gang-related violence in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Last year, there were 387 gang-related killings.

Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Teodoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> said everyone on the presidential plane was very upbeat and there was no talk of dangers posed by the escape of former Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, leader of a bloody coup last Aug. 28. `` Mr. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> has lost all capability of mounting any serious threat on the government,'' <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> said. `` If there was any question about that, then the president would have wavered in her decision to come to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but not for one minute did she waver in her plans.'' <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> was quiet today with no signs of trouble. The president, accompanied by seven <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers, was greeted in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> by Vice Foreign Minister <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuqing </PERSON> and taken to the <LOCATION> Diaoyutai </LOCATION> state guest house where she will stay during her three-day visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Three of her four daughters also are making the trip. On Friday, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> will be officially welcomed by new President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON> outside the Great Hall of the People and will hold talks with Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>. She is also to sign a trade protocol and a science and technology agreement. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> stopped supporting communist rebels in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> established full diplomatic relations in the mid-1970s. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> is the first <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> leader to visit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> in 1975. The high point of Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s first day in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was a visit to <LOCATION> Hongjian </LOCATION>, a village of 2,800 in coastal <LOCATION> Fujian </LOCATION> province that was home to her maternal great-grandfather, <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yuhuan </PERSON>. Xu settled in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> in 1861 and changed his name to <PERSON> Cojuangco </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s maiden name. More than half the residents of Hongjian are surnamed Xu. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and her entourage left for the one-hour drive to <LOCATION> Hongjian </LOCATION> immediately after arriving by special flight in <LOCATION> Xiamen </LOCATION>. Crowds lined the roads passing through fertile, terraced farmland. At <LOCATION> Hongjian </LOCATION>, residents waved yellow banners and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> flags, and set off firecrackers while a school band played. At the Xu family ancestral temple, which had been restored and painted for the visit, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> burned incense and bowed three times before memorial tablets. `` I came to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for reasons of state and for reasons personal to me, for I am both head of state of my country and a daughter of this village.'' she said in English. She ended the speech by saying in Chinese, `` I and my daughters and my colleagues again thank you for your welcome, which we will never forget.' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> visited a kindergarten, where she gave yellow `` <PERSON> Cory </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'' t-shirts to the children and looked at family photos in the home of an uncle, <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yuanxiang </PERSON>. Some villagers expressed regret that her one-hour visit was so brief. Her contacts with the 49 relatives was limited mainly to handshakes just before her departure.

 Nation of Islam leader <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> urged cheering students at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> to support <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for president. But others outside protested <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>'s on-campus lecture. `` <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is running to save a people; he is running to save the nation,'' <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> said Wednesday night. He campaigned with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> four years ago, but became a focus of controversy for what were widely considered anti-Jewish statements. He has been quoted as calling <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> a great man and <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> `` a gutter religion.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has distanced himself from his former ally since then. `` I do n't care if he rejects me,'' said <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> who told reporters at an earlier news conference Wednesday the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> contender `` does not want my help, nor need my support.'' `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is growing up to respect men of wisdom in black skins,'' <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> told the mixed black and white crowd of 2,000, most of whom stood and applauded. `` You should thank God <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has emerged.'' He denied he was an anti-Semite, had denigrated Judaism, or had boasted about the greatness of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>. He said Jews are repeating those charges in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which has its presidential primary next Tuesday. `` They are using me in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to try to derail <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> said. A counter-demonstration on the sidewalks outside the university's <ORGANIZATION> Irvine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auditorium </ORGANIZATION> attracted a crowd which police estimated at 1,000 but which university leaders said was about 400. Speakers at the rally denounced <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> for what they said was his anti-Semitic, anti-white rhetoric. Students held signs saying: `` Unity, Yes. Anti-Semitism, No'' and `` Free Speech, Yes. Hatred, No.'' University President <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackney </PERSON> defended the <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> visit, saying that `` in an academic community, open expression is the most fundamental value. We ca n't have free speech just some of the time for some of the people.'' <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>, in a speech lasting more than two hours, called <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` a racist, white society.'' He contended the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was assassinated `` with the express consent of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. government.'' `` How can I ask black people to fight for this country that do n't give a damn for us?'' he asked. The crowd cheered. He predicted that `` in less than 100 years blacks will equal the number of whites in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and we wo n't have to ask, ` Will there be a black in the White House?'''

 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military rejected a report that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers engaged up to 50 intruders in a two-hour firefight at a fuel depot. Maj. <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimaldo </PERSON> of the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> told reporters Wednesday night the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> sentries had `` confused the swaying of tropical palm trees with non-existent enemies.''

The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> said about 100 Marines were involved in a firefight with 40 to 50 `` unauthorized personnel'' first spotted at dusk Tuesday at the 800-acre <ORGANIZATION> Arraijan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION>, an underground fuel depot near <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. There apparently were no injuries on either side, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spokesman Col. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Sconyers </PERSON>.

 A crackdown on illegal use of food stamps has produced 11 arrests in southeast <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and indications that more can be expected, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says.

 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> gave a bad news-good news report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today on the impact of money cutbacks for building a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space station: completion will be delayed one year, but a robot laboratory on the station will be in operation earlier than planned. `` The realities of the federal budget environment are clear,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, wrote to the chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Committees that oversee the space agency. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> had asked for $ 767 million for the space station in the current fiscal year but received $ 425 million. The agency wanted $ 1.8 billion in the year that begins next Oct. 1, but the president's budget proposal would give it $ 1 billion. In letters to Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boland </PERSON>, D-Mass., and Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, R-Wis., <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said that left the agency three options: cutting down on the station, changing the way the program is managed or stretching out the time to build the <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said the third approach `` is the only sensible way'' since more than four years and $ 600 million already have gone into planning the station configuration and because the program management is solid and is producing results. Under the schedule he outlined, the first flight ferrying building materials for the station into space will be early in 1995, a year later than planned. It would be completed in late 1996. The fourth flight, rather than the sixth, will carry aloft a laboratory that can be `` man-tended'' _ visited and serviced periodically by astronauts. `` This approach basically involves a reordering of the assembly sequence leading towards this nation's goal in the mid-1990s _ a permanent presence in space,'' <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> wrote. Originally, the plans had been to have the station up and running in 1992, the 500th anniversary of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>' discovery of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said the new assembly sequence delays the bulk of attached sicence payloads until later in the construction sequence. It will take 16 flights to have the full station in operation and 11 flights before crews can be housed on the station.

The settlement followed six years of on-again, off-again negotiations between <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which neighbors <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and is home to an estimated 3 million Afghan refugees. The Moslem insurgents fighting the Marxist Afghan government for 10 years have headquarters in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> also serves as the conduit for foreign military aid to the guerrillas. Perez de Cuellar opened the 10-minute ceremony by thanking <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> for their `` tireless efforts.'' He thanked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which supports the guerrillas, and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which backs the government, for agreeing to guarantee the accord. Aides carried the leather-bound documents from one minister to the next for signing. Copies go to each country and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The agreement commits <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to not support `` directly or indirectly, rebellious or secessionist activities'' against each other, and it provides from the withdrawal of Soviet troops who entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979 to help the government. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he was confident the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would begin its troop withdrawal on schedule May 15. But in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> said today he foresees continued turmoil in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> because the agreement does n't address the issue of a new government to replace the one headed by President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. There is no provision in accord to end the war, and it says nothing about the composition of future Afghan governments. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> said it would continue to withhold recognition of the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government pending formation of a new one. In a letter to <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator in the talks, <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> said that `` in view of the realities of the situation in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and notwithstanding the accords signed today, -LRB- <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> -RRB- will continue to ... withhold extending recognition to the regime in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>.'' The Afghan guerrillas have said they will continue their war until the government is deposed. No guerrilla leaders attended the signing ceremony. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> stressed that the accord will let the Afghan people determine their fate. `` The challenge facing the Afghan people is great, but it can and must be met by them alone,'' the secretary-general said. `` Through their blood and sacrifice, the Afghans have earned the opportunity to resume their independence,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` Let us help them realize it.'' The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> estimates 1.5 million Afghans have been killed in the war, which began after an April 1978 communist coup. More than 10,000 Soviets have died in the fighting, Western sources estimate. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told American business leaders in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Wednesday that the accord may have international implications on a par with the superpower treaty signed in December to ban medium-range nuclear missiles. The Afghan agreement provides for withdrawal of all Soviet troops, pledges by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> of non-interference in each other's affairs, and the safe return of about 5 million refugees from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will guarantee <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s future non-alignment and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> will supervise the settlement, including the return of refugees. <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> will continue promoting an intra-Afghan settlement by shuttling between the fighters and the government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Another point left out of the accord is military aid. An informal understanding has been reported between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Diplomatic sources say each superpower will phase out such aid, while reserving the right to resume it if the other side does.

<TEXT>
 April in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> is supposed to smell of blossoms and perfume, but for residents in some neighborhoods, it reeked of rotten eggs. Fire department officials said Thursday that for the second time in a week, they had received telephone calls inquiring into the source of the unpleasant odor that greeted them when they woke up Wednesday. Officials said they did not know where the smell was coming from, but that it posed no health hazard. The stench permeated three southern <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> neighborhoods and suburban areas. `` People start to worry when they leave their own neighborhoods and find the same awful smell in other parts of the city,'' said the official, who declined to be identified in keeping with departmental policy. The spokesman said the fire department had received about a dozen complaints. He said pollution levels were normal and that there was no evidence a toxic substance had leaked over the city. `` No industrial facilities warned of spills,'' he said. The smells could not be identified, he said, because `` smells are very subjective and different people smelled different things.''

<HEAD>Ukrainian Crop Yields Increase, Despite Chernobyl</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Crop yields in the Soviet <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> have increased despite the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear accident two years ago, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The official news agency said the April 26, 1986, disaster caused no `` irreparable damage'' to the region's agriculture. Chernobyl is about 80 miles north of the Ukrainian capital of <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>. In the seven months after a blast and fire split open one of Chernobyl's reactors, 31 people died. Thousands were exposed to dangerous levels of radiation. There were concerns that the agriculture of the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, traditionally one of the breadbasket regions of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, might suffer from the release of radiation. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Denisenko </PERSON>, deputy chairman of the state agro-industrial committee of the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, as saying all farm products within the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> area are checked for radiation and pronounced safe before they are sold. He said grain yields per hectare in the <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> region, which includes Chernobyl, were up by 31 percent in 1987 as compared with the previous year. Such increases are not believed linked to mutations in plants that might be caused by radiation, he said. `` Crop rises are attributed only to introduction of intensive technologies of cultivation, as well as to intrduction of contract forms of labor organization,'' <PERSON> Denisenko </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Denisenko </PERSON> said the type of crops grown at some farms were switched on the recommendation of scientists. For instance, farms which had been growing vegetables now are planted in grain and potatoes which do not accumulate radioactive decay products, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said.

 The Rev. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, whose Moral Majority helped elect President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1980, said today he does not believe the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are ready to put religious leaders such as <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> in the White House. <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, speaking to nearly 700 newspaper editors, also said the sex-and-money scandals that have toppled <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> from their ministries signaled the end of celebrity status for televangelists. `` There will never again, and I thank God it's true, be a person that people look up to as God,'' <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> said. `` Celebrity status is history.'' Asked about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> said, `` I have no problem with Reverend <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> running, as long as he loses. `` I do n't think the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people want a reverend _ it has nothing to do with Democrat, Republican, black, white, liberal, conservative. I do n't think the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are ready for a reverend to be in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and I think it's a pretty good idea one never is.'' <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, participating in a panel discussion on the second day of the three-day <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> Editors convention, said he was heartened by a decision by a television committee within the National Religious Broadcasters to punish <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>. The committee members `` are recommending to all Christian stations in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that are members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> ... to drop <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s program if, in fact, he does not comply with the one-year required penalty placed upon him. ... Stations do not have to comply, but my guess is most of them will.'' Earlier today, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, urged the editors to support him in his battle to get a comprehensive trade bill passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` You hold the key to developing a thoughtful commentary on events,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, later adding, `` I challenge you to report the bill in some depths.'' In a session late Wednesday, big-city mayors gave generally good grades to newspapers for coverage of the plight of the urban poor, but said the media misunderstand the rise of blacks' political power and often fail to put a city's problems into a national context. Detroit Mayor <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said he has been pleased that the number of black reporters covering City Hall has increased in recent years, while <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> noted the new prominence given to black columnists. But <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> said he was concerned that some newspapers are not adequately covering the growth of black political power in cities. `` Maybe some newspapers even resent it,'' he said. <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> said he also believes the local media tend to report problems such as homelessness and inadequate housing from a local context rather than explaining that cities across the country are facing similar troubles. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> faulted the media for failing to report more on the problems of the underclass. `` These issues are not minority issues,'' <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> said. `` These are America's issues.'' Former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> said blacks and other minorities have made major strides in the 20 years since a national commission warned that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` is moving toward two societies, one black, one white.'' But, <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> said, `` There are still miles to go.'' <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> criticized the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administation for doing nothing to erase the economic differences between blacks and whites, and concluded: `` We probably have a worse problem now in relations between whites and blacks.'' The discussion of coverage of urban affairs followed a session earlier Wednesday in which <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON>, editor of the <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> -RRB- American-Statesman, delivered an <ORGANIZATION> ASNE </ORGANIZATION> report on minority employment on newspaper staffs. A survey of 67 percent of the nation's 1,630 daily newspapers showed a slow growth in the past year in employment of blacks, Hispanics, Asians and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>, from 6.56 percent to 7.02 percent. `` Obviously, much needs to be done,'' <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Grist </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>, editor of the <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> -RRB- Times, reported on a survey of journalists that found `` the people who gather and process the news today are predominantly white and male, but women and minorities are gaining in numbers.''

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> television station was fined the equivalent of $ 2,500 Thursday for showing a TV series that contained what the government called `` excessive violence.'' It was the first such fine imposed by the <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. The drama series `` The Final Verdict'' on <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> depicted `` the brutal killing of a family of six'' that had `` contravened the codes of practice relating to program standards,'' the authority said. The statement did not elaborate. It said the authority had received 97 complaints about the show, including many that claimed the Cantonese-language series portrayed the police force in a bad light. The series was in part about police corruption. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, while taking the view that proper regard should be given to the needs of creative work in drama productions, was of the opinion that the approach adopted in the series could have been more balanced,'' the statement said. The TV station said it had been verbally informed of the authority's decision and was awaiting further details.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> on Thursday pledged continued supplies of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms to Moslem guerrillas fighting the Communist government in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> after he signed the accord on the withdrawal of Soviet troops. After eight years and four months of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> pleas with the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> to pull its soldiers out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and Foreign Minster <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> put their signatures on an accord requiring Soviet withdrawal by Feb. 15, 1989. Soviet troops entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 and an estimated 115,000 now are there helping fight the Moslem insurgency. The secretary acknowledged that <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s future remains cloudy. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is leaving, he said, the superpowers will continue arming the factions and more work by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> will be needed to establish an independent government and bring home the estimated 5 million Afghan refugees. `` I do n't think anyone knows how that will take place,'' he told a news conference, but added: `` History has been made today.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> negotiated the agreement signed Thursday by <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, and by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as guarantors. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told reporters: `` For over eight years the <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> people have suffered a brutal war that has brought unmeasurable death, dislocation and destruction. `` The world community has long sought to remove the cause of this agony: the Soviet military of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. This effort has succeeded, and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is now committed to firm dates to comment and complete the withdrawal of its forces.'' Half the Soviet forces are to withdraw within 90 days, beginning May 15, and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> pledge not to interfere in each others' affairs. About 3.5 million Afghan refugees live in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, most in border camps and cities that serve as bases and supply points for the guerrillas. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the pledge by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, through which hundreds of millions of dollars worth of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid has flowed, does not prevent the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from continuing to arm the insurgents. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not recognize the Afghan government and `` we have made clear to Soviet leaders that, consistent with our obligations as guarantor, it is our right to provide military aid to the resistance.'' At the same time, the secretary added, `` we are ready to exercise that right, but we are prepared to meet restraint with restraint.'' `` Through their blood and sacrifice, the Afghans have earned the opportunity to resume their independence,'' he said before signing the accord. After Soviet troops entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> retaliated with economic sanctions against the Soviets, including a grain embargo, and kept the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team out of the 1980 Olympics in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s administration softened the sanctions, but <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his aides continued berating the Soviets at international conferences, including three summits with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Soviet withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> will remove `` a major burden to Soviet-American relations.'' `` The faithful implementation of the withdrawal commitments embodied in the accords signed today will do much to improve the atmosphere for our bilateral relations and for the resolution of other regional conflicts,'' he said. The settlement demonstrates that `` a major power can not impose its will by force of arms on even the smallest country when its citizens are united in their resistance,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> declared.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit widened dramatically in February to $ 13.8 billion, its biggest shortfall since October and the second straight jump, the government said today. Prices of stocks and the value of the dollar fell almost immediately in reaction to the announcement that the gap between imports and exports rose $ 1.4 billion from January's $ 12.4 billion imbalance. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell nearly 45 points in the first few minutes of market activity but regained about 8 points of that loss through the first 90 minutes of trading. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and central banks in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> intervened in the foreign exchange markets, buying dollars in large volumes after the currency lost 2 percent of it value against the Japanese yen and the German mark almost immediately after the announcement. Analysts had largely predicted beforehand that the February deficit would shrink slightly. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> commented, `` The overall report is discouraging in the sense that it went up instead of down.'' However, he said, the average trade deficit for January and February is $ 1.2 billion less than for the fourth quarter of 1987. `` The trade figures released this morning should be seen in context. As we have said before, too much emphasis should not be placed on any one month's figures,'' Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told reporters. `` We've stumbled here a little bit,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldlinger </PERSON>, an analyst for Capital Insight, an economic consulting firm based in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angles </LOCATION>. `` It reminds us that we have a major, major problem.'' For the first two months of 1988, the deficit is running at an annual rate of $ 157.6 billion, below the record $ 171.2 billion of last year but still worse than second highest imbalance of $ 156.2 billion in 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. Imports of foreign manufactured goods, oil and farm products increased by $ 2.3 billion in February. Leading the surge were imports of electrical equipment from abroad, up $ 323 million, and auto and truck parts, up $ 298 million. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports also rose, but by a smaller $ 1.3 billion from January. Commerce Secretary <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Verity </PERSON>, who is in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, said in a statement released by his office here that the February figures were disappointing despite what he called an `` underlying favorable trend.'' `` The figures show a substantial improvement from the average $ 15 billion deficit per month during the second half of 1987,'' <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We look forward to continued export-led growth.'' Analysts had anticipated an improvement in the trade balance in February because of the normally slack winter demand for imported goods, lower oil prices0and the fact that the month is the shorvest of the y ` ally is too early to tell,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. `` Underwater explosion is the way to describe it. We do n't know what caused the explosion. All we've got is an underwater explosion at this point.'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was steaming in the area after completing an escort operation Wednesday night. The spokesman said he assumed `` there were no other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vessels in close proximity,'' but could n't say for sure. `` They say the flooding is under control and they're pumping the thing out and doing that under auxiliary power,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. The <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> is the same type of guided-missile frigate as the USS Stark, the frigate that was hit last May in an Iraqi air attack. Thirty-seven Americans died in that attack. Ships of the <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazard </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> class normally carry a crew of about 190 sailors and 13 officers, but <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said he could not immediately provide a precise count of the number of men on the Roberts. One Pentagon official who asked not to be named said the explosion `` does not appear to have been caused by any failure of systems on board the ship.'' Another source added: `` The <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> hit something; we are assuming it was a mine.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had been told of the incident. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that he did not know how <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was told, but that the president was `` routinely informed'' about such matters by national security adviser <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> or a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the incident `` only emphasizes our concern for stopping the Iran-Iraq war,'' which has led to the mining of the gulf. He said the administration intended to step up pressure in the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> for a resolution that would not only put an end to the war but put the group on record in favor of sanctions against belligerents in the war.

 Trumpets blared and thousands of mourners shouted `` God is great!'' as this tiny country on Thursday buried two people slain on a hijacked <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> jetliner and vowed it would not meet the sky pirates' demands. `` <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> will never give in to blackmail, simple as that,'' said <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Marzouk </PERSON>, chief editor of <ORGANIZATION> Al-Anbaa </ORGANIZATION> newspaper and one of nearly 2,000 people attending the funeral. `` Even if they kill all the hostages there on the plane, we'll never, ever release the killers who are here in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>,'' he added, referring to the hijackers' demand for the freedom of 17 convicted terrorists A military honor guard escorted the flag-draped bodies of <PERSON> Khalid </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayyub </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON>, 20, and <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Shibib </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Khalidi </PERSON>, 24, into the ghost-like sea of mourners in traditional white Arab robes and headdresses. Hundreds of men stretched out hands to touch the biers as relatives carrying the bodies forced a weaving path through the throng to reach the graves dug in sandy soil. Traditional Moslem chants of `` Allahu Akbar!'' -LRB- `` God is great!'' -RRB- and `` La Illah Illa Allah!'' -LRB- `` There is no God but God!'' -RRB- resounded across the cemetery as tightly packed mourners passed stones over their heads to reach those at graveside who were covering the bodies. The crown prince, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Saad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>, led the procession of mourners along a condolence line of more than 60 male relatives of the slain men. Many kissed the prince, who has three distant relatives still aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 that was seized April 5 on a flight from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and flown to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> and now <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. All of those interviewed said they supported the government's refusal to grant the hijackers' demands, and some blamed <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for the jet's seizure `` Everybody agrees on one point, that we should not give in ... no matter what the sacrifices,'' said <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Saleh </PERSON>, a businessman. `` I think if we get the hijackers we should kill them, one after the other, so there'll be no one to do such a thing again,'' said <PERSON> Ghassahn </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Kunaini </PERSON>, a mechanical engineer. `` I do not accept anything, no deals.'' He denounced the hijackers' claims to be acting for Islam. `` These people, they know nothing about <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Kunaini </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Marzouk </PERSON> said `` <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> has set an example that you never, ever negotiate with terrorists. `` I think its unfortunate that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, they have always wanted to negotiate for the release of the hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' he added. `` Once you give in to blackmail once, you always give in to blackmail.'' <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> has repeatedly refused to consider freeing the 17 Islamic radicals, who were imprisoned for a series of bombings. On Wednesday, the defense minister, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Nawaf </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON> said `` <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> would not cave in, and would not change its attitude toward blackmail.'' The radical Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Watan said Thursday the hijackers in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> were demanding that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> commute the death penalty for three convicts condemned to death who are among the 17. Al-Watan did not give sources for its story.

<HEAD>Uninsured Workers Tell Hard-Luck Stories To House Panel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Uninsured workers with medical problems told their hard-luck stories Thursday to a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel weighing a sweeping plan to require that employers offer minimum health benefits. The employees _ including a a grocery store clerk from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and a doctors' office receptionist from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> _ said they have had to cope with inadequate medical care, unaffordable bills or both. <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, the receptionist, said the federal Medicaid program paid for her daughter <PERSON> Colleen </PERSON>'s two-month stay in the hospital after she was born prematurely. But she said five subsequent hospital stays have cost $ 22,000 _ and there's no one to pay it but herself and her husband on their wages of $ 6 an hour each. `` Even if I paid $ 100 every month, she'd be in college if not out of college by the time we ended up paying this bill,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, the clerk, said his parents were uninsured, had diabetes and died in their 30s for lack of proper medical care. He said he has diabetes and no insurance, and must depend on clinics with spotty care and no evening hours. `` If I get sick I must choose between working and supporting my family or going to the doctor and losing a day's pay,'' said <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>. `` If my employer had a mandatory insurance program, I could go to a regular pharmacy and see a doctor in the evening.'' The testimony came at a hearing before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on health and the environment. There are an estimated 37.2 million Americans without health insurance. About two-thirds of them are workers or dependents who would be covered by the plan under consideration by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The bill, introduced by Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., and Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., would require employers to provide a minimum package of health insurance to people working 17.5 hours a week or Benefits would have to include hospital and doctor care, prenatal and well-baby care, diagnostic testing and catastrophic protection. Employers would pay at least 80 percent of the premium. Pool arrangements and a phase-in period would make plans more affordable to small or new firms. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version of the bill, already approved by <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, also says very small or new employers would only have to provide catastrophic protection. The business community is divided on the plan. Many firms say they are philosophically opposed to mandated benefits, but corporations with health plans complain they are indirectly footing the bill for firms without them. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, representing hundreds of Fortune 500 companies and other employers, said in a statement Thursday that `` with each month, we hear from more members who think that a federal mandate is far from the worst alternative. And, many of the changes we wanted have been accepted.'' <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldbeck </PERSON>, president of the group, said the Kennedy-Waxman bill `` clearly does not have the support of the business community'' but said there is `` considerable strength to the growing trend of acceptance among many major companies.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lester </PERSON>, owner of a small carpentry and construction business in <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, said the bill would help small companies like his. He said he offers health insurance as an ethical obligation but its high cost keeps him from expanding. Furthermore, <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> said, `` in my attempts to be responsible now and in the future, I am put at a competitive disadvantage against those -LRB- employers -RRB- who do not insure.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> is a prime opponent of the Kennedy-Waxman bill and said Thursday it would cause many workers to lose other benefits and maybe even their jobs. The group is proposing alternatives it says would encourage rather than require employers to offer coverage. Among them: eliminating state minimum benefit requirements and allowing unincorporated businesses the same tax deductions enjoyed by incorporated firms. The state of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> has a law similar to the Kennedy-Waxman bill. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> legislature on Wednesday passed an even more sweeping measure that guarantees health coverage to everyone, not just people with jobs.

<HEAD>Gore Widens Nuclear-Policy Dispute With Dukakis</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS new poll results in grafs 9-10, Dukakis had</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> widened his nuclear-policy dispute with rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> today, saying the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor and his staff misstated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> positions on the subject. Meanwhile, a new poll showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leading <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, with <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> far behind both men. With less than a week to go before the big <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary, with 255 delegates at stake, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, in an attempt to get back in the race, has vigorously attacked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on the nuclear issue. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his campaign aides have said <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s charges are simply wrong, the efforts of a desperate candidate. The latest controversy began Wednesday when <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> erred in an interview in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> by saying he would consider first use of strategic nuclear weapons in case of a Soviet conventional attack in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> denounced that Wednesday as `` a major blunder'' but <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> strongly denied that it was. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he had merely reflected existing American and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> policy in holding open the option of a nuclear response to a successful Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> with conventional forces. In a speech today to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' staff compounded the first mistake by misstating <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> policy about using nuclear weapons. `` To say <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> policy is ` no early first use' is another error. ... We have not adopted that policy. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has not adopted that policy,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> told the newspaper editors. `` Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his campaign spokesman apparently do n't know that,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said at a news conference following the speech The new poll released today indicated <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was gaining support in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> but that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was maintaining his own strength. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> apparently had not picked up ground despite his vigorous campaigning. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had the support of 46 percent of 359 registered Democrats surveyed Monday and Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION>, followed by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> with 34 percent, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> with 7 percent and `` uncommitted'' with 5 percent. Eight percent of those polled were undecided. A previous <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> poll, conducted April 5-6, showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with 47 percent, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 31 percent and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> with 6 percent. Eight percent were uncommitted and 6 percent undecided. The polls' margin of sampling error was plus or minus 5 percentage points. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> appeared in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, with Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> called <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> a `` singularly important Democrat,'' and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> thanked <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> for holding off on any endorsements until after the primary season June 7. `` Gov. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, just keep a freeze on all endorsements and keep extending your support,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> continued to be plagued, however, by hostility from the Jewish community _ and from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who said politicians have withheld their criticism of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for fear of being called racist. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has rarely singled out any of the Democratic candidates for criticism. But he told the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>: `` I have to believe that a great many of us would find ourselves in great disagreement with the policies that he is proposing, and would perhaps be more vocal about them, if it was n't for concern that that'd be misinterpreted into some kind of a racial attack.'' Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called during the final day of a three-day swing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for mandatory death penalties for certain drug-related crimes, reflecting the prominence of the drug issue in this year's campaign. `` And, frankly, I'd like to find a way to make this penalty swift,'' he said in a breakfast speech to the Association for a Better <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> stirred the new foreign policy controversy after <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> `` we reserve the right to use nuclear force'' in the event of a Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` when there appears to be no other alternative.'' He added, `` I do n't think that's going to happen.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, battling for survival, quickly jumped on the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor and said he had `` made a significant mistake in saying that he would launch a nuclear strike against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under ... specific circumstances.'' At a news conference in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> `` ought to get his facts straight.'' `` The policy I advocated has been the policy of the government of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for many, many years,'' he said. `` It's the policy of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance.'' At an appearance Wednesday night before <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, Democrats, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said the transcript of the interview showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had been asked whether he could conceive of the first use of `` strategic'' weapons `` <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has purposely refused to respond to that hypothetical,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. `` The president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has traditionally refused to respond to that hypothetical.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, defense and foreign policy adviser to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> started answering the question thinking he was being asked about tactical nuclear weapons and that after <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> started speaking the questioner made reference to `` strategic.'' The transcript shows a comma before the phrase `` as a strategic weapon?'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said he assumed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would have given a different answer had he understood the question to be about strategic nuclear weapons.

<TEXT>
 A woman underwent an abortion in defiance of a court order obtained by the would-be father, but attorneys for both sides still want the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to settle the dispute. At issue is whether a woman has the sole authority to decide to have an abortion or if a father has rights that give him a say in the decision. Attorneys for the 18-year-old Terre Haute woman told the high court Wednesday that she had terminated her first-trimester pregnancy, but said the decision was hers alone. Their notice came a day after they asked the high court for an immediate review of the lower court injunction that prohibited an abortion. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said today that the case will go through the normal appeals process because speed is no longer essential. `` The case will go through the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> since it is not an emergency any more,'' said the spokeswoman. `` It probably will get back to us eventually. But there is no emergency now, and it has to go through the channels.'' A 61-page brief by the man's attorney, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bopp </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said the woman's reasons for wanting an abortion are `` an immature reasoning process, are insubstantial and border on the frivolous, and do not outweigh the strong interests of the father in seeing the child born and in his custody.'' <PERSON> Bopp </PERSON> described the woman as an unemployed high school dropout who began a relationship with the man, a delivery truck driver in Terre Haute, following a date on New Year's Eve. The lower court ruling cited testimony that the woman wanted an abortion to preserve her figure so she would look good in a bathing suit and to avoid being pregnant during the summer, <PERSON> Bopp </PERSON> said. The woman's attorneys refused to say where or when the abortion was performed. `` Faced with the decision of continuing with an unwanted pregnancy and with violating a court order, she made the decision she felt was right,'' said the notice signed by her attorney, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waples </PERSON>, legal director of the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. `` She did what she had to do to protect both her physical and emotional health,'' it said. <PERSON> Bopp </PERSON>, general counsel for the national Right to Life organization, said Wednesday he thinks `` somebody was exploiting and victimizing her to get her to get an abortion.'' `` An extremely serious and distressing thing has happened,'' he said, adding that his client `` is absolutely devastated that his child has been taken from him.'' <PERSON> Bopp </PERSON> said he and his client have n't considered seeking a contempt citation against the woman for violating <ORGANIZATION> Vigo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s order issued last week. On Monday, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> issued a permanent injunction. `` He loves this girl,'' <PERSON> Bopp </PERSON> said of his 24-year-old client. `` He's not interested in punishing her.'' If allowed to stand, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s ruling invites other <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> courts `` to engage in the same pernicious and impermissible inquiry into, and overruling of, a competent adult woman's decision to terminate her first trimester pregnancy,'' <PERSON> Waples </PERSON> told the court. The woman's attorneys said her first trimester would have ended sometime during the next two weeks. <PERSON> Waples </PERSON> argued <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s injunction violated the 1973 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling in <ORGANIZATION> Roe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> vs. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wade </ORGANIZATION>, which upheld a woman's right to an abortion during the first trimester of a pregnancy. <PERSON> Waples </PERSON> also said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in 1976 that a spouse can not veto a woman's decision to end a pregnancy during the first three months. <PERSON> Bopp </PERSON> said he wants a ruling detailing what rights a father has in such cases. `` Fathers have rights in particular cases. All we said in this case is we want those rights to be balanced'' with those of the mother, <PERSON> Bopp </PERSON> said. Since the case involves a paternity action, neither the woman nor the man has been identified in court records.

 An explosion rocked downtown <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> today, but there were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. Police cordoned off a block in front of City Hall, where the early evening blast apparently occurred. The cause of the explosion was not immediately clear, and police at the scene refused to comment on the incident. The explosion at about 6:30 p.m. -LRB- 12:30 p.m. EDT -RRB- was heard and felt at the offices of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, about four blocks from City Hall. There was no sign of injuries or damage to the exterior of City Hall. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Wootton </PERSON>, 12, said he saw wisps of smoke rising from the City Hall building shortly after the explosion. However, other witnesses near City Hall at the time of the explosion said they only felt the blast and did not see any smoke or evidence of damage.

 About 3,000 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> writers picketed <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> before they met to discuss granting waiver contracts in their 6-week-old strike against movie and television producers. The <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> meeting of about 1,000 striking writers following the mass picketing was closed to the public and news media. Results of a vote on the waiver contracts was withheld until the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> writers vote tonight. A `` yes'' vote would enable writers to negotiate contracts on a case-by-case basis with producers, even during the strike, if the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> grants a waiver. Such waivers are not given lightly _ the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> refused a special request for one at Monday's Academy Awards show. Meanwhile, the union disclosed that it had asked a federal mediator to step in to try to restart bargaining talks. `` We feel very strongly that what is needed now is for the two parties to meet,'' said <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON>. Joining picketing writers in <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION> were <PERSON> Joanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerns </PERSON>, star of the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> television series `` Growing Pains,'' actor <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> and `` Cheers'' star <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratzenberger </PERSON>. `` Every strike ultimately hurts everyone,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Kerns </PERSON>, who said her show's shooting schedule for new fall episodes has been pushed back from July to August. The picketing at Disney was the largest demonstration by the writers since a mass protest outside <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on March 11. Circling overhead was an aircraft towing a banner reading, `` Stop Mickey Mousing Around With The <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION>.'' Federal mediator <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> scheduled a Monday morning meeting between union bargainers and negotiators for the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION>. The meeting was requested by the writers union and `` by law we must attend and will,'' said <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, a spokesman for the producers. However, he added, `` Our attitude has n't changed.'' The 9,000-member <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> went on strike against the producers March 7. There have been no formal negotiations since talks broke off March 10. Disputed issues include how much writers are paid for foreign broadcasts of their material and for reruns on domestic television, and how much creative control they have over their work.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has followed up on informal pledges and officially notified the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that it has stopped commercial whaling, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Commerce Secretary <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Verity </PERSON> said Thursday. `` This is a significant international achievement which removes a major obstacle to U.S.-Soviet cooperation in fisheries,'' <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> told a news conference.

The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whaling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, to which the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> belongs, agreed in 1982 to a moratorium on commercial whaling beginning in 1986 to give whale stocks a chance to recover from severe cuts.

<HEAD>Rise in Business Inventories Slows After Months of Big Gains</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Trade Deficit Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rebounding sales helped dampen growth of business inventories in February to a slight 0.1 percent after four big monthly increases, the government reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said inventories increased by only $ 825 million, pushing the total of unsold items on store shelves and backlots to a seasonally adjusted $ 715.9 billion. The small gain followed a string of much steeper increases that came in the months after the stock market crash. Inventories rose 0.7 percent in January, 0.9 percent in December, 0.8 percent in November and 1.2 percent in October. Economists had feared the inventory buildup would force production cutbacks and slow economic growth early in 1988. But Thursday's inventory numbers, along with a separate report on trade showing a $ 2.3 bilion increase in imports in February, provide evidence that domestic demand has not weakened. The February increase in goods held on shelves and backlots was occurring while business sales were climbing 0.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 468.3 billion, reversing a 0.5 percent drop in January. `` It's really two sides of the same puzzle,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, who heads <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` If inventories continued to rise at the same time that sales were falling, that would clearly be bad news. ... But that's not happening ... so it's OK.'' <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Wefa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a forecasting service headquartered near <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said imports were at least partially responsible for the inventory growth `` A lot of the inventories that had built up were imported goods. ... That's one of the reasons I'm less concerned about the trade numbers than I might have been,'' he said. Another <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report Thursday showed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchandise trade deficit widened to $ 13.8 billion in February from $ 12.4 billion in January. The February rise in inventories was held back by a 1.1 percent fall in inventories held by retailers. This decrease reflected primarily a 5.2 percent drop in the backlog of unsold cars. Excluding autos, retail inventories were up 0.4 percent. Inventories held at the wholesale level were up 0.9 percent, while manufacturers' inventories grew by 0.5 percent. The 0.6 percent overall sales rise was led by a 1.2 percent increase in wholesale sales in February, a 0.6 percent rise in sales by retailers and a 0.1 percent rise in sales by manufacturers. In an advance report on Wednesday, the government said retail sales increased 0.8 percent in March. The combination of rising sales and slightly rising inventories pushed the inventory to sales ratio down from 1.54 in January to 1.53 in February. That means it would take 1.53 months to exhaust inventories at the February sales pace. That ratio is not considered abnormally high.

 At first, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>, sitting in the cockpit of his plane, was n't even aware that a small aircraft had landed on top of him.

<TEXT>
 If you wanted to spend as much time in the air as <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, you'd have to lift off right now and not set your plane down until late 1992. The two _ pilots, flight instructors and business partners with a combined total of more than 40,000 hours of flying time _ retire their wings this year. Ms. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who was one of the first women in the state to receive the pilot examiners rating back in the 1950s, retires Friday, while Ms. <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> plans to retire in June. She was the first woman in the nation to be designated an airline transport pilot examiner by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in 1968. The women, both 62, will be honored Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. They ran a flight school in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> for 16 years. Over their combined 90-year careers, they've taught thousands of pilots to fly and many of their former charges now are with major airlines around the world. But flying was a man's pursuit when they started flying. `` I started when I was 17,'' Ms. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` I just wanted to fly.'' `` Airplanes were something different. And <PERSON> Amelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON> was doing her thing at that time,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>. `` They were doing all sorts of different things and setting records.'' Flying is easier today than it once was _ what with better planes and more sophisticated cockpit equipment, they said. But it's not quite as much fun, Ms. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` When I was learning to fly there were so few restrictions,'' she said. `` You could take an airplane _ a J-3 Cub that did n't have anything in it but an air speed indicator and altimeter _ and just go anywhere in the country.'' During their careers of teaching students the two have had `` close calls but no disasters,'' Ms. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. Student pilots tend to react in predictable ways, and instructors can usually anticipate problems. `` You know what to expect,'' she said. `` Most people have the same apprehensions and the same fears.''

<HEAD>PCBs From Mother's Milk Passed Down Six Generations, Researcher

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Toxic PCBs passed from mother to child through breast milk will still be measurable in the parent's great-great-great grandchildren, a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> researcher told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee Thursday `` The problem is, these compounds refuse to go away for any reasonable amount of time,'' said <PERSON> Wayland </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Swain </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Eco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, in testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on investigations and oversight. <PERSON> Swain </PERSON> drew on earlier research into the transmission of polychlorinated biphenyls _ PCBs for short _ to calculate the level of the substance passed to an infant through nursing and retained in the infant's body. An infant nursed by a mother who regularly consumed <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> fish would be exposed to 6.2 milligrams of <ORGANIZATION> PCB </ORGANIZATION> by the end of 12 months, <PERSON> Swain </PERSON> said. Of that amount, 5.3 milligrams would be retained in the infant's body. `` It is clear that infants nursed by mothers who have consumed <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> fish exceed recommended consumption guidelines -LRB- for adults -RRB- for their entire breast-feeding experience,'' <PERSON> Swain </PERSON> said. The level of PCBs retained by such infants was more than seven times the maximum consumption level recommended by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Swain </PERSON> said. PCBs are passed to a child not only through beast feeding but from the mother's body through the placenta before birth, <PERSON> Swain </PERSON> said. A 20-year-old woman giving birth to a child passes on sufficient PCBs so that even if all exposure to the substance were stopped, `` I would still measure PCB in the body fat ... six generations in the future,'' <PERSON> Swain </PERSON> said. Production of PCBs, believed to cause cancer, has been banned for years, but the substance continues to enter the environment through such sources as older electric transformers. Recent research suggests that the decline in <ORGANIZATION> PCB </ORGANIZATION> levels in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> has slowed, and that the substance continues to circulate from the sediment into the water and back into the sediment again in a perpetual cycle that produces continuing contamination of the food chain. Children exposed the PCBs as infants tend to be shorter, have smaller heads, be more likely to catch infectious diseases, and exhibit an inability to focus on their surroundings, <PERSON> Swain </PERSON> said.

Defense attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Scardino </PERSON> has called the attack by the lion `` a tragic accident.'' <PERSON> Durkovitz </PERSON> faces a maximum two - to 10-year sentence and $ 5,000 fine if convicted of the felony <PERSON> Durkovitz </PERSON> testified today that he had taken all the precautions he could think of while walking the lion, who was there as part of an exhibit, out of the flea market building. `` I immediately jumped on top of him and kept yelling, ` No. No,''' <PERSON> Durkovitz </PERSON> said. `` I was trying to separate little <PERSON> Roxanne </PERSON> from the lion. `` I looked up at -LRB- a security guard -RRB- and said, ` Shoot him, shoot him,''' <PERSON> Durkovitz </PERSON> said. `` About the same time he shot him, he bit down on <PERSON> Roxanne </PERSON>. `` I took every step I knew possible that I had been using for two years -LRB- to prevent an accident -RRB-,'' he said. `` I'm very sorry that it happened.'' The state rested its case Wednesday after calling <PERSON> Roxanne </PERSON> and her mother, <PERSON> Sonia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Roxanne </PERSON>, wearing a white sailor's cap to cover her injured head, testified that all she remembered about the attack was that `` the lion got me. I did n't know what it was.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said her daughter was in the hospital for a month and has had problems since she returned to school in February. `` She has trouble concentrating on her work during the day and she has trouble following directions,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> testified that they went to the flea market to buy a gift and the attack occurred shortly after they entered the building. `` The lion was wrestling with my daughter and I was pulling it trying to get it off my daughter,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said. `` I was screaming out for her and she was screaming out for me. `` I was screaming for help and she would call out my name, ` Mom! Mom! Help me!''' Mrs. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> recalled. Mrs. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said she pulled the lion's mane, but to no avail and that the animal tried to put the girl's head into its mouth. `` I saw the lion when he took her scalp off,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said. `` I felt really helpless at that time and at that moment I felt it was going to kill her.'' She said a security guard shot the lion and it loosened its grip on her child. It later was destroyed. <PERSON> Scardino </PERSON> also complained to State District Judge <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Poe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> that the media coverage of the trial was intense and `` pro-prosecution.'' The trial of <PERSON> Durkovitz </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> resident, had been moved here because of pretrial publicity Also Wednesday, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhter </PERSON>, mammal curator at the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION>, testified that lions seek out children, but are intimidated by adults. `` It attacks its prey because it moves,'' <PERSON> Ruhter </PERSON> said. `` It's his livelihood You see it in 9-week-old cats when they attack a ball.''

<HEAD>Soviets Announce Seizures of Videotapes, Literature from
Foreigners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Videocassettes of Rambo and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> movies and Western news clippings of the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear accident were among `` ideological contraband'' seized from foreigners by Soviet customs, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The official news agency did not say exactly when or over what time period the seizures of pamphlets, books and videocassettes took place, only that separate incidents were involved. The dispatch was based on an article in Whistle, a newspaper of the railroad ministry. Among the confiscated material were 500 `` anti-Soviet'' publications taken from two British students, identified only as <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Warrowsmith </PERSON> and D. Dows. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the two were at the <LOCATION> Brest </LOCATION> checkpoint in <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION> on the Polish border when the material was discovered. `` The subversive literature had been supplied to them by a ` charity' organization concerned about the alleged ` suppression' of -LRB- religious -RRB- believers,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the two had planned to distribute the material in <LOCATION> Minsk </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, where they were headed on tourist visas. Under <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of `` glasnost,'' or openness, many formally banned authors have been published in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and state-run media have tackled previously taboo subjects. But the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> announcement of the seizures made it clear glasnost does not extend to material considered `` ideological contraband.'' Another case described in the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> report involved a woman identified as <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bashkatoff </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. She allegedly was carrying several leaflets and clippings from `` the bourgeois press with fabrications about the Chernobyl accident, concealed in her luggage.'' `` She also attempted absent-mindedly to leave behind in her train compartment a maliciously slanderous book called ` <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Quadrille,''' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Another tourist, who was not identified, was caught carrying dozens of copies of `` People on the March,'' a pamphlet which authorities say urges Soviets of ethnic German origin to emigrate to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` Some of the latest items of ideological contraband include video recordings of various sermons, karate lessons, with a sadistic bent, pornography and anti-Soviet films like ` Rambo' or the <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> ` Afghan Series,''' the dispatch said. The latter was apparently a reference to the <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> movie `` The Living Daylights,'' in which the fictional British agent 007, played by <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON>, outwits the Soviet army in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Soviet officials have bitterly complained that <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON>'s muscled Vietnam War veteran Rambo presents a negative stereotype of Soviets. The report from <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said people carrying material judged to be ideological contraband will be deported from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Average American Will Have Paid Tax Obligation by May 5 This Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The `` average'' American will have to work 126 days this year _ two more than in 1987 _ just to pay federal, state and local taxes, the <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. `` Tax Freedom Day'' will fall on May 5, the latest ever. The best taxpayers have fared in the past decade was in 1984 _ when most of the big 1981 federal income-tax reduction had taken effect _ when Tax Freedom Day fell on April 28, economists for the foundation said. But federal tax increases enacted in 1982, 1984 and 1987 `` have lopped off big chunks of the'81 cuts, and Social Security hikes have made further inroads until, like the <LOCATION> Cheshire </LOCATION> Cat in ` Alice in Wonderland,' nothing remains but the smile,'' the foundation said. Last year, the big day was May 4; this year's May 5 date is two days later because 1988 is a leap year, which meant there was a Feb. 29 this year. With the approach of the Friday midnight deadline for filing federal tax returns _ the first under the heavily revised tax law _ there were these other tax developments: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, whose telephone `` assistors'' have been giving the wrong answer to about 28 of every 100 tax questions this year, disclosed some factors it will consider in determining whether to waive certain penalties for taxpayers who follow such bad advice The agency said penalties for late filing, negligence and failure to pay can be waived if the taxpayers proves he or she acted reasonably. It will consider pertinent factors such as whether the taxpayer also sought the correct answer in an <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> publication, as well as what specific question was asked of the assistor and what was the actual answer. It also would help the taxpayer to know the name of the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> employee and the time and date of the telephone call. _ House Republicans and several business organizations began a campaign to block future income-tax increases, amend the Constitution to require a balanced budget and pass a `` bill of rights'' to help taxpayers in disputes with the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> Seventy-eight <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> representatives have signed a promise to oppose raising income taxes, while 190 -LRB- mostly Republicans -RRB- lawmakers have signed a petition requiring the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to allow a vote on the balanced-budget amendment. Such a vote requires the assent of 218 representatives. `` The federal budget can be balanced in less than four years without raising taxes if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> controls the growth of spending to less than the inflation rate,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxpayers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers. _ The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> released a survey indicating that 75 percent of business owners polled think the tax laws are more complex since the 1986 revision About 55 percent say their companies are spending more time on tax forms, but two-thirds would not be willing to pay more in order to get simpler taxes. The <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based research organization, assumes that individuals pay all taxes _ including those collected from corporations _ when it calculates Tax Freedom Day. The economists simply divide all federal, state and local tax collections among taxpayers and assume that every penny earned each year goes to government until tax obligations are satisfied. Viewed from another perspective, the foundation estimates the average taxpayer will work 1 hour and 50 minutes each eight-hour day to pay federal taxes, and another 55 minutes for state and local taxes. That's two minutes longer for federal taxes than in 1987 but the same as last year for state and local taxes. By the same measure, housing will require 1 hour and 24 minutes -LRB- unchanged -RRB-; food and tobacco, 56 minutes -LRB- two minutes less -RRB-; transportation 40 minutes -LRB- unchanged -RRB-; medical care 39 minutes -LRB- unchanged -RRB-; clothing 22 minutes -LRB- one minute less -RRB-; recreation 21 minutes -LRB- unchanged -RRB-; and everything else will take 53 minutes of work, one minute less than last year.

 <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> bought his first property, a dilapidated office building, for $ 1,000 in 1936. A decade later he sold it for $ 165,000; now his real estate equity is estimated at $ 1.4 billion. <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Mindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON>, the daughter of a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> hatmaker, had been the <LOCATION> Chesterfield </LOCATION> cigarette girl before she settled on a career in real estate and, ultimately, married <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>. Now this king of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> real estate and the queen of the <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> hotel chain are in a court devoid of royalty; they surrendered Thursday and pleaded innocent to federal and state charges of tax evasion, falsifying business records and, in <PERSON> Leona </PERSON>'s case, extortion conspiracy The charges are so shocking because they involve people whose wealth is nearly unbounded. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> was listed 21st on the Forbes list of the 400 richest Americans last year; he owns the Empire State Building. Their estate in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, central to the charges, consists of a 28-room Tudor mansion on 29 acres. But that is not the only <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> residence: <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> also spend time at a duplex atop the Park Lane Hotel, and at a lakefront condominium in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> shower each other with gifts -LRB- sometimes paid for with company money, according to the indictment -RRB- and their generosity sometimes extends to others In 1986, they made the single largest philanthropic gesture in the country, giving $ 33 million to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. Neither of the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> was born of wealth. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s father was a notions buyer for a wholesale dry goods firm; the son graduated from high school but never attended college. His first job, as office boy at the real-estate firm he eventually came to own, paid $ 12 a week. His credo? `` All you have to do is buy, and if you make a mistake, the market comes along and takes care of it,'' he once said. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, 79, owns 50,000 apartments and 7 million feet of commercial space. He bought the Empire State Building, then the world's tallest building, in the 1950s: `` Every morning you would look out of the window and the building is staring you in the face. So, you'd say, ` Well, I got ta buy it.'' On July 4, 1976, <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> lit the Empire State Building in red, white and blue _ a tribute not to the Bicentennial, but to his wife's birthday. It cost $ 100,000. `` It was less than a necklace,'' he said. <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, 67, is <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>'s second wife; his previous marriage ended in divorce in 1972 after 33 years, with no children. <PERSON> Leona </PERSON>, too, was married before, to a lawyer whom she divorced in 1959. Her only son died in 1982. The former showroom model and advertising mannequin was a successful real estate broker when <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> met her in 1971; he hired her as a $ 500,000-a-year senior vice president and married her a year later. By all accounts, she is just wild about <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>; <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> records that she calls him `` gorgeous one ... pussycat ... snooky, wooky, dooky.'' Shortly after their marriage, in 1973, a man wearing a gas mask broke into their <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> bedroom. `` Wake up darling, we have company,'' <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> told her husband, nudging him awake. The naked Helmsleys chased the intruder, but before he fled he stabbed <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> in the chest with a bread knife, puncturing her lung. When <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> put <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> in charge of the <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> hotels in 1980, he was not providing her with a sinecure. She took complete charge, and became the star of ads for the hotel chain which trumpeted her demanding nature as a guarantee of quality. `` It's the only palace in the world where the Queen stands guard,'' said one ad for the Helmsley Palace in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. The royal appellation is matched by a volatile, queen-size temper, according to many employees. `` She comes on as extremely forthright, but that sometimes turns into brutality,'' said one former employee, advertising executive <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Maas </PERSON>. `` She's icy, without compassion; she is remorseless and pitiless.'' According to the federal indictment, <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> did more than harass her employees _ she shook them down, demanding kickbacks in exchange for their continued employment. Sources said some two dozen <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> employees testified before the grand jury under grant of immunity. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>, by contrast, is known as a courtly gentleman. He does not envy <PERSON> Leona </PERSON>'s celebrity _ the ads, the interviews, the profiles on `` 60 Minutes.'' `` I think one person should take the limelight. It dilutes if there are two,'' <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> said in 1986. `` I have a different aspect of the business. I like to plan buildings, organize them and finance them. Once I build it, I could n't care less, and that's where she comes in. She is fantastic at entertaining and day-to-day operations _ details I hate. The only thing I like is adding up a column of figures and getting the bottom line.'' Even prior to their latest legal problems, <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> received some unwelcome publicity when it was reported she failed to pay more than $ 38,000 in sales tax for jewelry at <ORGANIZATION> Van </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cleef </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Arpels. She was never charged, but sources said she was given immunity for her cooperation with authorities. Then last year, a series of reports in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> detailed allegations that the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> had charged millions of dollars in renovations of their <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> mansion to their business. Those revelations, the basis of the indictments, were fueled by tips from the Queen's disgruntled subjects. `` Most of the calls seem to have been prompted by people's dislike of Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>,'' said Post reporter <PERSON> Ransdell </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierson </PERSON>

<HEAD>State Threatens Fines For Garbage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Debt-plagued <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, which has n't had regular garbage pickup for six months, faces fines of $ 10,000 or more if the city does not clean up well enough by May 3, officials say. Although state laws against illegal dumping and failure to dispose of garbage apply to all property owners, the state's action is aimed primarily at the city, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Assistant State's Attorney <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said Wednesday `` The main thrust of this is getting rid of a public health problem,'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said. Officials in this poverty-stricken riverfront city of 55,000 told state regulators that garbage pickup should resume Friday. And they have budgeted $ 210,800 of federal community development funds to have the backlog of garbage that has piled up taken care of. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Mensing </PERSON>, regional manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said that if the cleanup does n't go fast enough, the city could face a state injunction, fines as high as $ 10,000 and penalties up to $ 1,000 per additional day of non-compliance for each violation, he said. `` Just where we would draw the line, I do n't know,'' <PERSON> Mensing </PERSON> said. `` We have n't discussed it.'' <PERSON> Mensing </PERSON> said he could not estimate the amount of garbage that has accumulated in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> since regular garbage pickup ceased in October because the city owed $ 262,000 to the private company that it had hired to do the collecting. The company has since sued the city. The only garbage hauling that has been done since then has been in the form of volunteer drives, or work done privately by companies hired by individual businesses and homeowners. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurre </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Side </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, said the onset of warm weather raises the specter of disease and increased rat infestations caused by rotting garbage. Over the objections of Mayor Carl Officer, other city officials recently contracted with another private company <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to do trash pickup until December for $ 350,000. Officer continues to contend that the city can not afford to pay for the service and that property owners should pay private companies to haul away their trash.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> says he will urge President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s successor to appoint a special commission to set national arts policy goals for the 1990s, which he predicted will be a decade of `` innovation, experiment and idealism.'' `` The time for revaluation is upon us, and it should take place at the highest level,'' said <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian and former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> adviser to Presidents Kennedy and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> delivered the first <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON> Lecture on Arts and Public Policy here Wednesday night in honor of the late chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration.

<HEAD>Parliament Approves Private Television In Spain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> voted Thursday to end the 32-year state monopoly on television broadcasting by passing a law authorizing the creation of three private TV networks. The law takes effect following publication in the Official State Bulletin. The law stipulates that no individual nor group may own more than 25 percent of any of the three networks, a provision seen by major publishing groups as an attempt to limit the influence of the established media. Participation of foreign investors is limited to a second 25 percent share in any of the three networks. There are two state-controlled national television networks in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and three more local networks controlled by the regional governments of <LOCATION> Galicia </LOCATION>, the Basque Country and <LOCATION> Catalonia </LOCATION>. Spanish National Television was founded in 1956 during the authoritarian regime of Gen. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>. Spaniards watch more TV than citizens of the other 11 <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> member nations except <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Channel 10, a London-based company with <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> and foreign participation, began broadcasting in <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> via satellite in January. Since entering office in 1982, the government of Socialist Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> had pledged to enact legislation creating three nationwide private TV networks. Minister of <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> and Tourism <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> <PERSON> Caballero </PERSON> has estimated that none of the three networks will be ready to go on the air for 18 months to three years following enactment of the law. The ministry has estimated the cost of upgrading the existing transmission network and land lines at between $ 45 million to $ 180 million. Once the new law goes into effect, the government is expected to request public bids for the private network licenses based on criteria to be set by the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. In the last three years, several publishing groups in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> have formed groups in preparation for the bidding.

 <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders and politicians whose support as `` super delegates'' could prove crucial in winning the presidential nomination are giving <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> nearly half of the 101-delegate lead he holds over rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Were it not for the support of these delegates, who are going to the Democratic National Convention because of offices they currently or formerly held, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would be ahead of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> by fewer than 44 delegate votes, according to a survey by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Until today's gain of 52 previously uncommitted delegates in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held but a narrow lead over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> without the support of the party leaders and politicians. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has 816.15 delegates overall including 72.5 votes from super delegates. He has gained 24 of those super delegates over the last month, including nine members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> nominated this week to attend the party's convention. By comparison, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is supported by none of the 32 senators nominated this week. He has 715.1 delegates overall, including 30.1 super delegates, a gain of 11 over the last month. Sens. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, whose own presidential campaigns are lagging far behind those of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, were nominated by their <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> colleagues to be convention delegates. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> picked up an additional four <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> delegates, while <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> gained two. The nominations were made in a closed-door meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats on Tuesday. A list of the nominees was obtained by the AP. Still, 268.25 super delegates, most of those chosen so far, remain uncommitted, some saying they believe they have an obligation to defer making a choice and others saying they just ca n't make up their minds. Sixteen of the senators named so far are uncommitted. `` It looks wide open,'' said <PERSON> LarryAnn </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, a delegate from <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. `` I'm not convinced that any of the three candidates still in the field are who we should go with.'' Others are waiting for local party leaders to make a decision so they can follow suit. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, a delegate from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> who is party chairman in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, said he put off picking a candidate until Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> endorsed a hopeful. Then <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said last week he would not endorse anyone until the primaries and caucuses are over in June. `` I waited for <PERSON> Mario </PERSON>, and now I'm left holding the bag,'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. In all 4,164 votes are to be cast at the national convention July 18-21 in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, and 2,083 are needed to win the nomination. The super delegates from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will be among as many as 646 party leaders, governors and others who will be national convention delegates. Former <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> warned that the super delegates should not be used to thwart <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s candidacy. `` I think the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> must avoid at all costs even the perception that it is acting in any way to deny that which <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has won fair and square,'' he said. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who is running a distant third in the overall delegate count with 404.55, has the support of 33.55 super delegates, 10 of whom have become supporters in the last month. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who suspended active campaigning after his single-digit, fourth-place finish in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, has picked up three super delegates over the past month, raising his overall total to 171.5, including 18.5 super delegates. The <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> campaign has been urging super delegates to stay uncommitted, according to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a delegate from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> who said campaign officials told him `` worse things could happen than a brokered convention.'' While the campaigns have been trying to win over super delegates, at least one says he's been overlooked: <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a former state senator from <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. `` I do n't get no respect, even if I am a super delegate,'' he said. `` It's amazing that no one has called, but I think it shows the extent to which the national campaigns are stretched thin.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> frigate <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> hit a mine near <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> today while on patrol in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said six sailors were injured. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Zakhem </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador to <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> there were no fatalities. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said the ship was in no danger of sinking. He said four of the injured sailors suffered second-degree burns and two others had slight back injuries. The injured were evacuated to a medical facility aboard the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, an amphibious transport dock ship, <PERSON> Zakhem </PERSON> said. The stricken frigate and the <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION> serve with the 10-unit <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> that patrol the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been patroling gulf waters and escorting reflagged Kuwaiti tankers to protect them from attacks by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which has been at war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> since 1980. Pentagon sources said the explosion occurred near <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, which the Iranian navy has used in its attacks on gulf shipping. But gulf-based maritime salvage executives, speaking on condition of anonymity, pointed to a location 50 miles north of the <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION> and about 100 miles south of <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION>. At the time of the blast, the frigate was returning from international waters off <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, where it had escorted the U.S.-reflagged Kuwaiti tanker Gas Queen, the executives said. The single tanker convoy reached <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> on Wednesday. Regions off <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> and others near <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> have been infested with mines, believed to have been laid by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. U.S.-led Western mine sweeping operations in the two regions and elsewhere in the gulf last summer detected and detonated dozens of mines. It was off <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> last July that the U.S.-reflagged Kuwaiti tanker <LOCATION> Bridgeton </LOCATION> hit a mine in the first U.S.-protected convoy. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said there had been no recent reports by mine sweepers in the area that mines had been sighted. The explosion `` caused flooding in the engine room and some hull damage. The flooding is under control, and the ship is in the process of pumping out the water. It's operating under auxiliary power,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said that the USS Wainwright, a cruiser, was en route to the site to offer assistance. In the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said it fired long-range missiles today at <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and two other Iranian cities in retaliation for an Iranian missile that crashed into <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. Both sides said many civilians were killed or wounded. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said an Iranian missile slammed into a residential area of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> on Wednesday night. `` Many civilians were killed and wounded, including women and children, in addition to many houses, cars and shops being damaged,'' the agency quoted a military spokesman as saying. It said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> responded by firing one long-range missile at <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION> and another at the holy city of <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION> today. A third missile was fired at <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said an unspecified number of civilians were killed and wounded when two mosques and several houses and shops were damaged in <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> reported that <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes bombed residential areas in the city of <LOCATION> Dezful </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Government and <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> leaders today agreed to renew technical talks on implementing a cease-fire and to start high-level negotiations to end the six-year civil war. The stalled cease-fire technical talks were to start immediately in the southern border post of <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, site of earlier meetings. The high-level talks were to start in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> on Friday. A government delegation traveled to <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> almost immediately after the agreement was announced at noon by the Contras and <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON>, information minister for the leftist Sandinista government. The Sandinistas backed off from their demand that the technical talks be held in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> and agreed to a Contra request that they be in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>. In exchange, the Contras stopped insisting that Friday's political talks begin only if the Sapoa talks were successful. `` The Contras agreed that if the talks are not finished today, they'll conclude in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview. Earlier today, <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> representatives <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stadthagen </PERSON> flew into the capital's Sandino airport in a private aircraft and were met by Tourism Minister <PERSON> Herty </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewites </PERSON>. It was the first time the government had allowed Contras into <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, a Sandinista negotiator accused the Contras of not being serious about ending the civil war. `` We have serious doubts they want to enter into a definitive cease-fire,'' Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> told reporter. `` There's a problem of confidence,'' he said, adding that the Nicaraguan government did not want to see the talks unravel. `` If they -LRB- Contras -RRB- do n't come on the 15th -LRB- Friday -RRB-, we'll have to see the alternatives.'' The cease-fire pact was signed March 23 in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>. The talks are to work out details of how to get Contra forces into several zones inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as a prelude to ending the war. The military talks stalled April 8 after six rounds in which the two sides agreed only to establish seven zones to which Contra fighters would be confined during a 60-day truce that went into effect on April 1. Still to be worked out are security for the rebels in those zones, methods of resupplying them and other details concerning the guerrillas during the two months allowed for negotiating a permanent cease-fire. Rebel fighters are scheduled to be in the zones by Friday, but they have not even begun gathering. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have agreed that once they verify the rebels are in the zones, half of the 1,400 jailed Contras will be freed. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is estimated to have more than 3,000 political prisoners. The Sandinistas released 100 soon after the provisional truce was signed.

 A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> frigate on patrol in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> apparently struck an underwater mine today, injuring six sailors, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said today. The ship, the USS <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, was in no danger of sinking, said <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. No one was killed and the six sailors did not sustain life-threatening injuries, he added. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said that four of the sailors had second-degree burns; the other two had slight back injuries. None of the injuries was considered life-threatening. All were flown from by helicopter from the ship for medical treatment. The ship is based in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, and left there for <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> duty on Jan. 11. `` At approximately 10:10 this morning EDT, the USS <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> ... experienced an underwater explosion in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> at a point approximately 70 miles due east of <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION> -LRB- a navigational aid -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. The explosion `` caused flooding in the engine room and some hull damage. The flooding is under control, and the ship is in the process of pumping out the water. It's operating under auxiliary power.'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said that the USS Wainwright, a cruiser, `` is en route to the site to offer assistance and should be there soon.'' The incident occurred in the central <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, well to the south of the spot near the Iranian-controlled <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> where a reflagged Kuwaiti tanker, the <LOCATION> Bridgeton </LOCATION>, hit a mine during the first of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s convoy operation last July. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said there had been no recent reports by mine-sweepers in the area that mines had been sighted. The spokesman refused to say that the underwater explosion had been caused by a mine, citing the paucity of information from initial reports. `` It really is too early to tell,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. `` Underwater explosion is the way to describe it. We do n't know what caused the explosion. All we've got is an underwater explosion at this point.'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was steaming in the area after completing an escort operation Wednesday night. The spokesman said he assumed `` there were no other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vessels in close proximity,'' but could n't say for sure. `` They say the flooding is under control and they're pumping the thing out and doing that under auxiliary power,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. Within hours of the explosion, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said, the ship had begun steaming toward port in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> is the same type of guided-missile frigate as the USS Stark, the frigate that was hit last May in an Iraqi air attack. Thirty-seven Americans died in that attack. Ships of the <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazard </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> class normally carry a crew of about 190 sailors and 13 officers. The Pentagon said the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was carrying about 225 men, however, because it had a helicopter detachment aboard from <LOCATION> Mayport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.. One Pentagon official who asked not to be named said the explosion `` does not appear to have been caused by any failure of systems on board the ship. Another source added: `` The <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> hit something; we are assuming it was a mine.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was under the command of Cmdr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinn </PERSON>. It fixed the location of the explosion at 26.25 degrees north and 52.15 degrees east. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had been told of the incident. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that he did not know how <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was told, but that the president was `` routinely informed'' about such matters by national security adviser <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> or a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the incident `` only emphasizes our concern for stopping the Iran-Iraq war,'' which has led to the mining of the gulf. He said the administration intended to step up pressure in the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> for a resolution that would not only put an end to the war but put the group on record in favor of sanctions against belligerents in the war.

<TEXT>
 The accord for a Soviet troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> was hailed Thursday by countries in both the East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> as a vital first step toward peace, and some offered to help Afghan refugees. In southern <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, however, skepticism remained over some aspects of the plan, particularly the continued aid to combatants. The agreements, signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> by representatives of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, will take effect May 15 and will commit <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> not to support `` directly or indirectly, rebellious or secessionist activities'' against each other after nine years of civil war and Soviet entanglement. In <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> welcomed the agreements and said it hoped they would yield further improvements in superpower relations. `` The Soviet occupation of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> has been a serious impediment in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> relations,'' <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The implementation of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreements will, we hope, lead to further improvements in the atmosphere between East and West.'' Austrian Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Alois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mock </PERSON> called the agreements `` a step to the strengthening of East-West relaxation.'' The accords open the possibility that `` other regional conflicts be settled peacefully,'' <PERSON> Mock </PERSON> said. Indian Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> expressed concern, however, about a continued flow of weapons to Afghan rebels and said some of them were reaching <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s Sikh extremists through neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The Sikh extremists, fighting for a separate nation in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, used rocket-propelled grenades for the first time last month. Officials in the northwest Indian state say the rebels also have increased their stock of AK-47 assault rifles. Indian officials recently charged that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was helping Sikhs acquire weapons. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> denied the charge. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION>, an independent English-language daily, said in an editorial titled `` Meaningless Agreement'': `` <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will be able to withdraw its troops without having to acknowledge the plain fact that it has failed to pacify <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in the face of resistance by U.S.-backed mujahedeen. But on the face of it, the agreement will be pretty meaningless otherwise. `` For it will stipulate that the Americans and the Russians will continue to be entitled to provide arms to their respective clients. And while <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> will formally agree not to interfere in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s internal affairs, it will in reality continue to do so inasmuch as it will still serve as a conduit for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms supplies to the mujahedeen.'' The accord was praised in communist nations. Non-aligned communist <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, which has repeatedly condemned <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, said the agreements represent `` an important first step which could lead to a final peace settlement in that country.'' In a commentary, the state <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency said the final solution of the conflict is still far away because the region has been `` burdened by different international interests.'' `` All sides involved must now show maximum goodwill, statesman-like wisdom and responsibility,'' the Czechoslovak <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. Both <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> said they would join a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> military force observing the accord in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, both neutral Scandinavian countries, also have agreed in principle to send observers to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Danish newspapers said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> also have been asked to join the force, reportedly to be led by a Finnish general. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> planned to assist in the relocation of 5 million civilian refugees, said a Foreign Ministry spokesman in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Acting Foreign Ministry spokesman <PERSON> Koichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Haraguchi </PERSON> said, `` Also, it is our intention to extend financial assistance to facilitate the safe and honorable return of the refugees to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> also announced plans to aid refugees, with an $ 18.7 million grant for resettlement. Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said the grant was conditional on the setting up of `` properly coordinated international arrangements'' for the return of millions of Afghan refugees from neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Used Condoms Collected From Sewage Plant To Test ``Safe Sex''
Advice</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Health workers are counting used condoms that float to the surface of the city's sewage treatment plant pools in an effort to find out how many people are heeding advice about safe sex to avoid AIDS. Hundreds of condoms float in the water at open-air pools at waste water treatment plants. For the last eight months, city workers have been using long-handled fish nets to scoop the multicolored condoms from the sewage and count them each day. The study, which should be completed in a year, may help determine whether people are heeding warnings to use condoms as a way to prevent the spread of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus, officials said. `` We talk a lot about using condoms, but the question is whether we're really doing it,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON>, who heads a federally funded AIDS study in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. `` We're serious about it, we really want to find out whether more condoms are being used, or whether people are just buying them and storing them by the bedside for potential future use.'' The study includes counting the number of condoms sold at drugstores and those given away free by the health department, Ms. <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> said. Though officials do n't know how many condoms are flushed down toilets or simply thrown away, they said they had no intention of going through garbage. `` It's certainly not a very pleasant job, but it is important,'' said <PERSON> Courtland </PERSON> <PERSON> Storck </PERSON>, the AIDS surveillance supervisor for the health department. `` If it does work, and we hope it does, then hopefully other cities would adapt a similar program.'' The health department said it has so far retrieved between 200 and 400 condoms each day floating in the sewage pools. A <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> doctor first suggested the study method in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, but officials say the first such count was made in the late 1970s in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 About 1,500 Jewish youths, many carrying <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> flags, took part in a `` March of the Living'' Thursday at the site of the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Birkenau </LOCATION> death camps as <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> honored its victims of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, hundreds of academics and historians gathered at the State Jewish Theater for a two-day conference on the struggle and martyrdom of Jews and Poles during the 1939-45 Nazi occupation. The march and the conference began a week of observances of the 45th anniversary of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Ghetto Uprising, in which several hundred Jews fought a three-week battle against <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s army. The uprising began April 19, 1943. The observance is the largest ever organized in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to honor the memory of the millions of victims of the Nazi Holocaust who died on Polish soil. Among those attending the conference were several Polish government ministers, senior <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials and <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops. Despite the somber commemorations, the chief foreign ministry spokesman denounced <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for violating the basic human rights of young Palestinians demonstrating against the Israeli occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Staniszewski </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> news conference that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> wanted to pay homage to the Jewish ghetto fighters who `` were Polish citizens and ... fought together with us'' against the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. But he said `` this emotional attitude ... does not influence our policies towards <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' `` The brutality of the repressions used by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities toward the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> population evokes popular outrage and condemnation around the world,'' said <PERSON> Staniszewski </PERSON>. `` We categorically protest against the Israeli policies.'' As light snow fell, the march began near the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> camp's main gates, where the legend in German reads, `` Work makes you free. The blue-jacketed youths, marching behind a banner reading `` March of the Living,'' trekked two miles to the site of the <LOCATION> Birkenau </LOCATION> death camp. There, as a cold wind whistled through the vast open field still surrounded by double rows of barbed wire fences and wooden watch towers, the young Jews lit a memorial flame and scattered soil from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> by the monument. They followed a cantor in saying Kaddish, the Hebrew prayer for the dead. <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> is the German name for the Polish city of <LOCATION> Oswiecim </LOCATION>, where the camp was located. The monument also commemorates the camp at <LOCATION> Birkenau </LOCATION>, where the Germans built huge gas chambers and crematoria. In an emotional ceremony by the stark, gray international monument honoring those who died at the two camps, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials declared that only a strong Jewish state could prevent another Holocaust. The marchers carried blue-and-white <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> flags. `` It is the obligation of every Jew to feel solidarity with every other Jew,'' said Israeli Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Itzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Navon </PERSON>, the highest-ranking <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> official ever to visit <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` Only by strengthening the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, multiplying and increasing our numbers,'' can we prevail, <PERSON> Navon </PERSON> said, speaking in Hebrew and English. More than 4,500 foreign visitors have come to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to take part in the observances that end April 20, including some 2,000 Israelis and hundreds of Jews from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. The observances climax Tuesday, the anniversary of the outbreak of the uprising, in which several hundred Jewish insurgents staged a desperate three-week struggle against the final Nazi extermination drive to liquidate the ghetto's last 75,000 inhabitants. One visitor to the camp's museum, <PERSON> Ayelet </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuper </PERSON>, 15, of <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, said it was emotionally wrenching to look at a room full of children's shoes taken from victims before they were murdered. `` And there was a small crutch, like for an 8-year old,' she said. `` That got to me a lot.'' More than 4 million people died at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Birkenau </LOCATION>, about 70 percent of whom were Jews.

 If the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> team up for an interplanetary mission, a trip to the moon would be preferable to shooting for Mars, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> FLetcher </PERSON> said Thursday. A Mars mission would probably span four or five presidential administrations, requiring a degree of stable relations that has not been demonstrated between the two countries, <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has favored a joint mission to Mars, but such a proposal has not gone beyond the talking stage. <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said a program of cooperative unmanned activities should take place before astronauts and cosmonauts climb into a space ship for the two-year round trip to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. `` Flying out to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> together before building such a foundation could, for several reasons, be less practical,'' he said. <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> spoke to the National Space Symposium in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION> on the same day that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> formally advised <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that cutbacks in money will delay completion of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space station for a year until late 1996. The first of 16 shuttle flights needed to put men and materials into orbit is expected to be early in 1995, instead of 1994. That puts the completion target date four years behind the schedule set originally. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had planned to have the space station up and working in 1992 as a celebration of the 500th anniversary of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>' discovery of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. In a letter to the chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committees that oversee <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> FLetcher </PERSON> said that by revising the schedule, a robot laboratory should operating in 1995. The laboratory had been slated for the sixth shuttle supply mission; it now is on the fourth. `` The realities of the federal budget environment are clear,'' <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> told Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boland </PERSON>, D-Mass., and Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> had asked for $ 767 million for the space station in the current fiscal year but received $ 425 The agency wanted $ 1.8 billion in the year that begins Oct. 1, but President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s budget proposes $ 1 billion <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said that left <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> three options: cutting down on the station, changing the way the program is managed or stretching out the time to build the station. The third approach `` is the only sensible way,'' <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said. More than four years and $ 600 million already have gone into planning the station configuration. The scope of the station ca n't be cut further `` without jeopardizing the safety and usefulness of the station,'' <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said. The facility, which will be home to crews of six and eight for months at a time, originally was to cost $ 8 billion, but that figure will have quadrupled when all costs _ including those of stretch out and delays _ are taken into account. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> plan to attach their own modules to the station structure and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> will contribute the shuttle docking facilities. <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> called the space station a major investment in the nation's future by providing a research and technology laboratory, an <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and celestial observatory, and `` a point of departure for the expansion of human presence and activity into the solar system.'' In <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the Soviets realize that many technical unknowns are involved in a manned Mars mission, such as the effects of prolonged weightlessness on humans. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has experience with moon walkers, while the Soviets have amassed data through lengthy stays on their space stations.

 `` You, you, you'' _ the familiar chant of fans of ultra-conservative <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> _ rang out in a municipal courtroom as the talk show host was cleared of charges that he assaulted a gay rights activist during a program. Judge <PERSON> Emil </PERSON> <PERSON> DelBaglivo </PERSON> found <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> innocent of assaulting <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Humm </PERSON>, a 34-year-old spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lesbian </ORGANIZATION> and Gay Rights. <PERSON> DelBaglivo </PERSON> watched a videotape of the show and listened to testimony during a 4 -LCB- - hour trial Wednesday before issuing his decision The 55-year-old <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>, flashed his familiar toothy grin to the crowd after the verdict and said, `` I am very pleased.'' <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> faced up to six months in jail and a $ 1,000 fine had he been convicted. <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> was charged with assaulting <PERSON> Humm </PERSON> Dec. 9 during the taping of a show that involved a discussion of the role of the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in the modern world. The taping, at <ORGANIZATION> WWOR-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Secaucus </LOCATION>, was interrupted by a bomb threat, and the show was never broadcast. The judge said there were conflicting eyewitness accounts so the key evidence was the 25-minute videotape. The tape shows <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> in a face-to-face argument with <PERSON> Humm </PERSON>. <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> said, `` Keep your bodily fluids to yourself'' as he wiped a small amount of spittle from his face. <PERSON> Humm </PERSON> said the comment about bodily fluids implied that because he was a gay person he also had AIDS, and that his fluids were to be feared. On the tape, <PERSON> Humm </PERSON> replied with an epithet, fumbled with the microphone, and raised his right arm. <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> abruptly struck <PERSON> Humm </PERSON>'s arm away, and in doing so, he grazed <PERSON> Humm </PERSON>'s face <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> then admonished <PERSON> Humm </PERSON>, `` Watch your language.'' <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, argued that the blow did not cause pain to <PERSON> Humm </PERSON> and presented a neurologist who testified that it would have been impossible for <PERSON> Humm </PERSON> to be injured. <PERSON> Humm </PERSON> testified: `` I felt humiliated, and it stung. There was no sustained injury, but it hurt.''

<HEAD>Plane Crash Blamed on Crew, Air Traffic Control Error</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The crash of an <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> passenger jet in February in which 20 people died was blamed on errors by the crew and an air traffic controller, investigators said. A report on the investigation of the crash in the Siberian city of <LOCATION> Surgut </LOCATION>, 1,400 miles from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, was published Wednesday by the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. The state <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flght </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said the pilot of the Tupolev-134 asked for permission to use a runway not normally used at the Surgut airport and tried to land the craft in poor visibility. The official report said the plane carried 45 passengers and a crew of six. Seventeen passengers and three crew members were killed, and all of the other 31 people aboard were injured. `` Since the commander did not stick to the flight parameters set by the air traffic controller, the plane found itself in a position, as to the landing strip, which made safe landing impossible,'' the report said. `` The plane therefore made a rough landing away from the landing strip, it was wrecked by overloads and burst into flames,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The report said co-pilot <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuneiko </PERSON> was flying the plane, while commander <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shavrovich </PERSON> was talking with the air traffic controller about switching runways. `` Flight director <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maltsev </PERSON> met the crew's request, but in doing so, in violation of the rules, he failed to switch on ground radio facilities for a landing approach and organize observation of weather in the direction of the landing course,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The plane was on a 1,600-mile flight across the western <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> when it crashed at its final stop. Rescue operations were impaired by poorly trained personnel and insufficient technical facilities at <ORGANIZATION> Surgut </ORGANIZATION>, the report said. `` By the results of the investigation, the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> is taking necessary steps to rule out a recurrence of such aircraft accidents,'' the report said, but did not give details.

 A state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee, reversing the stand it took last year, voted 5-4 Thursday to approve a Martin Luther King holiday for <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. The issue has been a source of national controversy since then-Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> rescinded a holiday that his predecessor had proclaimed without legislative approval. The sponsor of the measure, Democrat <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, said she was confident the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will approve the bill if it gets through the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> majority caucus. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed a similar measure 35-25 last year. Government Committee Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mawhinney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Macdonald </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Safford </LOCATION> switched their votes. Mrs. <PERSON> Macdonald </PERSON> did not explain her reasons, but <PERSON> Mawhinney </PERSON> said he felt it was time to provide spiritual as well as physical help to those in need. The bill is virtually identical to last year's and would conform <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s practice to the federal government's. Instead of being called a King holiday, the new day off would be known as Martin Luther King Jr.-Civil Rights Day, however. And instead of being known as Presidents Day, the combined <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> holidays would be known as <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington-Abraham </PERSON> Lincoln Day. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was removed by a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> court of impeachment earlier this month, and his successor, Gov. Rose Mofford, sent her chief of staff to the committee Thursday to join religious, union and tourism industry officials in urging passage of the bill. The measure would combine the holidays for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> into a single February holiday and create a January holiday for King. Although <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said that he rescinded the proclaimed holiday on the advice of Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> and that his Democratic predecessor, Gov. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, usurped a legislative prerogative in ordering state money spent on a holiday, the action generated an international controversy.

 Mayor <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who died Thursday after battling cancer for a year, was eulogized by friends and colleagues as a common man and a hero who enjoyed a love affair with his city. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, 60, was taken to <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> from his home at 4:50 a.m. after his wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, realized he was n't breathing. City officials said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> was dead on arrival. An autopsy was scheduled to determine the cause of death. Council member <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Calinger </PERSON> said the mayor `` learned not to give up and fought hard until the end. At a time when we worry about not having heroes and not having role models, <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> was a hero.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who replaced Mayor <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> when <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> was recalled last year, was stricken with cancer two months after taking office. He was hospitalized off and on for treatment but kept up a full schedule at City Hall until last month. When he was released from a hospital stay earlier this month, his doctor denied he was dying and said he expected the mayor to return to work within two weeks. Fellow politicians described <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> on Thursday as someone who gave others the courage to live. `` If you were to ask me about <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON>, only two words would come to mind _ courage and leadership,'' said Acting Mayor <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Conley </PERSON>, who took over for <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> temporarily last month. As recently as 10 days ago, <PERSON> Conley </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> showed him pictures of his grandchildren and said he was planning a party to celebrate his return to office. `` He had been very positive and upbeat about his cancer. He thought he had a good chance of beating it,'' <PERSON> Conley </PERSON> said. Gov. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> called him `` a man of peace and concord. He loved being mayor. He loved serving the people, and in public service he gave the very essence of his nature, a spirit of unity which brought the people of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> together.'' `` He was really just a common guy that sincerely wanted, not for himself, but for the city of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> to be successful during his term,'' council member <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomasak </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, a Democrat, was first elected to the City Council in 1981. He was named mayor Feb. 3, 1987, after <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> was recalled, to serve the remaining 2 -LCB- years of <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>'s term. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> had said becoming mayor was a lifelong dream. But after taking office, he was diagnosed as having an inoperable tumor in his lung. That tumor was destroyed during treatment, but two more tumors were later found in his brain. `` Do n't look so gloomy,'' he told reporters at the time. `` I've whipped cancer before and I'm going to whip this one. Radiation treatments and chemotherapy reduced the tumors, but weakened by treatment, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> was stricken with shingles on his eyes and became mentally disoriented. <PERSON> Conley </PERSON> said at a City Hall news conference that he would continue as acting mayor until the council meets after <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s funeral to choose a new mayor A native of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Creighton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preparatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in 1945 and then served briefly in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> before the end of World War II. He worked as a telephone lineman, later moving up to marketing manager before retiring from the telephone company in 1981. `` I'm not ready to sit down in a rocking chair,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said when he took over as mayor. `` It's a zest for life.'' Survivors include his wife, three sons, a daughter, and six grandchildren. Funeral arrangements were pending.

<TEXT>
 Evangelist <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> said Thursday he welcomed tough measures taken against fallen TV minister <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> and said that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is not ready for a <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> or <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the White House. `` I have no problem with Reverend <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> running, as long as he loses,'' <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people want a reverend _ it has nothing to do with Democrat, Republican, black, white, liberal, conservative. I do n't think the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are ready for a reverend to be in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and I think it's a pretty good idea one never is.'' <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>'s comments came as part of a panel discussion on televangelists on the second day of a three-day convention of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION>. An estimated 685 editors attending the convention also heard from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and his fellow Democratic presidential hopeful, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, as well as from <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to end fighting in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> said he was pleased that television representatives in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> had agreed to recommend that all Christian stations drop <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s religious program if he returns to preaching before his one-year suspension expires. `` That does n't mean all the stations have to comply with that requirement,'' <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> said. `` But my guess is that most of them will.'' <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, along with panelists <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadden </PERSON>, sociology professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hargrove </PERSON>, told the editors that the sex scandals that brought down <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> marked the end of an era for televangelists. `` We're witnessing a serious readjustment of the work of religious politics,'' <PERSON> Hadden </PERSON> said. `` The questions about financial accountability already had been raised. The sex scandals were the final icing on the cake,'' <PERSON> Hargrove </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> said he believes `` it was inevitable that these catastrophies occurred'' and said it was not the press that brought down the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>. `` They brought themselves down.'' `` Frankly,'' he said, `` an inevitable housecleaning was overdue. Yes, it's hurt everybody ... but the major hurt is the terrible damage done to the value systems and the principle systems of young people in this country.'' <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, who took over the debt-ridden <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministry after the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION>' departure and resigned from it late last year, said one good thing had come out of the Bakker-Swaggart sex scandals: the end of televangelists' celebrity status. `` There will never again, and I thank God it's true, be a person that people look to as God. Celebrity status is history.'' Earlier in the day, the editors heard a plea from <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to cover all the details of a comprehensive trade bill now before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He called the measure one of the most important now on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. `` You hold the keys to developing thoughtful commentary on events,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said.

 The chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> appropriations panel on Thursday called for suspension of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to its three poorest <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies, and stormed out of a hearing to protest the administration's failure to produce details of previous assistance to the countries. Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the subcommittee on foreign operations, told <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> witnesses he was `` fed up with getting this mush from you You must really think we're saps up here.'' He then suspended the hearing after only 50 minutes and strode out of the room. `` There was no sense in my sitting listening for the information only to be told they they did n't have it,'' Obey told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> later. `` That was the same thing they said before.'' At the root of the dispute are demands by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members spend more money on the defense of the alliance, in what is known as `` burden sharing.'' Obey's outburst was prompted by the administration's failure to provide the committee with detailed lists of the surplus military equipment being transferred to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> this year. Obey said he had asked for the lists several months ago to help the committee decide how to allocate funds for the administration's 1989 spending request of $ 1.4 billion for the three countries, where the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains military bases and some 15,000 personnel The three are the poorest members of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, and the administration contends the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must fund them in order to ensure continued basing rights. Obey, a vocal foe of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spending on <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not `` be engaged in unilateral welfare efforts'' for these countries. Rather, he said, the aid should be a joint <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> effort. `` My view is that there should be zero funding this year for base rights countries,'' he said. Obey claimed that taxpayers in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, are paying more for the defense of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> than those in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. `` My taxpayers are fed up with this, and so am I.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxpayer spends more than $ 1,000 a year on the defense of the free world, while British taxpayers spend per capita $ 488, the French $ 511, the West Germans $ 433 and the Japanese $ 163, Obey said. `` We're being taken for a ride.'' Obey railed against such <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members as <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> `` who constantly lecture us on our deficit and on managing our economy'' but fail to share the burden of maintaining the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, defending the administration's spending request _ which is 41 percent higher than the base rights funding of 1981 _ said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests clearly lie in a continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` Our border begins there,'' he said. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodworth </PERSON> said in his testimony that while <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense spending grew much more than that of other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members in the years between 1981 and 1986, `` that pattern is now reversed.'' He said several <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries, among them <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, increased their defense spending by about 3 percent in 1987, while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> increase was only 0.1 percent and in 1988 it will decline more than 3 percent.

 A federal judge who was the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s antitrust chief testified Thursday before a grand jury investigating conflict-of-interest allegations against Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> apparently was questioned about <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s role in formulating <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> policy on the breakup of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telgraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> stock at a time when the attorney general owned telephone stock. <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>, who headed the antitrust division in 1985 and 1986, presumably was asked about his knowledge of meetings <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had with executives of four of the seven regional telephone companies formed by the 1984 breakup of AT & amp; <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> meetings with executives of the so-called <ORGANIZATION> Baby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies when he and his wife owned 91 shares of <ORGANIZATION> Baby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> stock is being investigated by independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> for possible conflict-of-interest violations. As of April 1, <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said there was insufficient evidence to bring criminal charges against the attorney general in connection with the Baby Bell stock or other matters still under investigation. But the investigation is expected to continue until month's end, when <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> is prepared to issue a report if he does not bring charges. At the time of their meetings with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Baby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bells </ORGANIZATION> were seeking a modification of the 1984 decree that would allow them to manufacture telephone equipment and offer long-distance and computer services. In an about-face last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> urged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> to allow the <ORGANIZATION> Baby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bells </ORGANIZATION> to expand their operations to include equipment manufacturing, long-distance and computer services. The Meeses sold their shares in the <ORGANIZATION> Baby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> stock for $ 14,000 last summer. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> denied most of the request by the government and the Baby Bells, except that he allowed the regional companies to perform some types of information services. Before joining the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here in late 1986, <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> had been assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust division, Previously, he had been the No. 2 official in the division. There was no immediate comment from the judge's chambers about <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>'s testimony. Last year, he was nominated to a vacancy on the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> but withdrew his name from consideration following reports that he had once used marijuana and allegations of possible conflict-of-interest arising from his ownership of stock in a company that is one of the largest operators of cable television systems. A preliminary inquiry conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> examined 16 instances in which <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> dealt with cable industry issues while holding the stock, but determined that either his participation or chance of gain was too minimal to violate conflict-of-interest laws.

 Philippine President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> visited the home of her Chinese ancestors on Thursday, while her nation remained her nation was on full military alert amid concerns of a coup attempt during her absence. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Teodoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> played down the threat of a coup attempt at home, despite the escape from prison of former Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, who tried to overthrow the president in August. `` Mr. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> has lost all capability of mounting any serious threat on the government,'' <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> said. `` If there was any question about that, then the president would have wavered in her decision to come to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but not for one minute did she waver in her plans.'' The president, accompanied by seven cabinet ministers, was greeted by Vice Foreign Minister <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuqing </PERSON> and taken to the <LOCATION> Diaoyutai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, where she will stay during her three-day visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. On Friday she will be officially welcomed by President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON> outside the Great Hall of the People and will hold talks with Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>. She is also to sign a trade protocol and a science and technology agreement. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> is also to meet senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> on Saturday before leaving for an overnight stay in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Fujian </LOCATION> province, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> visited her ancestral village of <LOCATION> Hongjian </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s great-grandfather, <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yuhuan </PERSON>, lived there until leaving for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> 120 years ago. Village residents waved yellow banners and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> flags and set off firecrackers while a school band played. Crowds lined the roads passing through fertile, terraced farmland. At the Xu family ancestral temple, which had been restored and painted for the visit, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> burned incense and bowed three times before memorial tablets. `` I came to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for reasons of state and for reasons personal to me, for I am both head of state of my country and, in a way, a daughter of this village,'' she told 49 relatives she was meeting for the first time. `` The end of traveling, we are told, is to return. I have returned for my family, and for other Filipinos of Chinese descent, to retrace their steps and attain some understanding of the industry and creativity that led them forth to new beginnings in other lands,'' she said. She ended the speech by saying in Chinese, `` I and my daughters and my colleagues again thank you for your welcome which we will never forget.' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> visited a kindergarten where she gave yellow `` <PERSON> Cory </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'' T-shirts to the children and looked at family photos in the home of an uncle, <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yuanxiang </PERSON>. Her visit to <PERSON> Hongjian </PERSON> lasted a little more than an hour. Fujian Gov. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhaoguo </PERSON> hosted Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> at a lavish banquet and thanked the president for her gift to <PERSON> Hongjian </PERSON> of a playground, to be built with $ 15,000 in donations by <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> businessmen. The Philippine military was put on full alert nationwide, and opposition leaders suggested she should scrub the trip to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> because of political unrest at home. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s last trip abroad was in November 1986 to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. She said that canceling the trip would be `` the greatest folly'' because she wanted to show <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` that we have at least achieved the internal political stability and peace to play a responsible and important role that is expected of us in <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> affairs.''

 A revival of Mighty Mouse cartoons, a junior high school drama and three shows on the Constitution's anniversary were among 23 programs honored by a children's television advocacy group Action for Children's Television presented its annual achievement awards to radio and video programs from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, at its 20th anniversary celebration. `` These are programs that have something special to pat them on their back,'' said <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Charren </PERSON>, who founded the 15,000-member organization that monitors children's programming. `` This is what children need and deserve from TV.'' Among the winners in the commercial television category was the updated `` Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures'' by animator <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakshi </PERSON>, who created the 1971 feature-length `` adult'' cartoon `` Fritz the Cat.'' `` ` Mighty Mouse' is TV animation the way it used to be,'' <PERSON> Charren </PERSON> said. `` It's not trying to sell something and it has something to say to children even while it's showing Mighty Mouse come to save the day.'' The cartoon originally appeared on television from 1955 to about 1966. `` It does n't talk down to children,'' said <PERSON> Bakshi </PERSON>, 48, who also made `` The Lord of the Rings'' and `` Heavy Traffic'' in the 1970s. `` I wanted to make sure the level of writing was not below an adult level.'' ACT had a separate award category for programs about the 200th anniversary of the Constitution. Among the winners was CBS' `` The Day They Came To Arrest the Book,'' based on a story by journalist <PERSON> Nat </PERSON> <PERSON> Hentoff </PERSON> about attempts to ban <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON>'s novel `` Huckleberry Finn.'' In public television, ACT gave an award to `` Degrassi Junior High'' from <ORGANIZATION> WGBH </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, which it called `` a stimulating TV series on adolescents in action.'' But <PERSON> Charren </PERSON> said the 1987-88 awards reflected a dearth of news programming for children, citing the demise of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>'s `` In the News'' and other news shows in the last year. ACT last fall began campaigning for an increase in news for children. `` It's so important because this is the information that kids need so that when they to be 18 they can vote,'' <PERSON> Charren </PERSON> said. `` You ca n't pick that up from the kinds of newscasts kids listen to.'' <PERSON> Charren </PERSON> also criticized commercial broadcasters for caving in to promotional interests and ratings, saying that from 1984-87 about 70 Saturday morning children's shows featured characters based on toys. The ACT award recipients were: Public television: `` Degrassi Junior High,'' <ORGANIZATION> WGBH-TV </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>; `` Wonderworks,'' <ORGANIZATION> WQED </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>; `` Square One TV,'' Children's Television Workshop Commercial television: `` Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures,'' Bakshi-Hyde Ventures; `` Young Universe,'' <ORGANIZATION> Behrens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; `` Popcorn,'' <PERSON> KATU </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>; `` The Kidsongs TV Show,'' Together Again Productions; `` Rap-Around,'' <ORGANIZATION> WBZ-TV </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>; `` Newsbag,'' <ORGANIZATION> WTTG </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> Radio: <ORGANIZATION> Ainsley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> for KPAL-AM, Little Rock, Ark.

 Real estate mogul <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> and his `` hotel queen'' wife <PERSON> Leona </PERSON>, one of the world's wealthiest couples, loudly asserted their innocence Thursday as they were arraigned in an alleged $ 4 million tax scam. `` Not guilty,'' both replied in strong voices to charges in a 188-count state indictment accusing them of hiding millions of dollars in renovations on their <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> mansion as business expenses. `` The fact is they did not pay millions of dollars in income tax,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> in announcing a 47-count federal indictment against the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> on similar charges. He noted the charges were announced the day before federal income tax returns are due. The Helmsleys were joined in pleading innocent to the state charges by <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Turco </PERSON>, 45, of <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s former top aide, and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Licari </PERSON>, 51, of <LOCATION> Oyster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cove </LOCATION>, the couple's former financial manager Both also were named in the federal indictment, which contained similar charges. That indictment also accused Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Turco </PERSON> of extortion conspiracy; they allegedly received kickbacks by threatening suppliers with a cutoff of <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> business and by threatening <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> employees with loss of their jobs. The Helmsleys, whose holdings include the Empire State Building and the Helmsley Palace Hotel, are estimated to be worth at least $ 1.4 billion. According to the indictments, the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> spent approximately $ 4 million to refurbish the mansion with an enclosure for one of the estate's two pools; a breakfast room and marble dance floor on the roof of that enclosure; an elaborate indoor-outdoor stereo system; more than $ 370,000 in landscaping; and an assortment of furniture and paintings. In addition, a $ 45,000 birthday present for <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> _ a clock in the shape of the Helmsley Building on Park Avenue _ was billed to and paid by the <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lane </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION> in December 1984, it said. And four jade art objects worth $ 500,000 were paid for by four <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hotels as furniture purchases in 1984, the charges said. Prior to their arraignment, the Helmsleys were booked and fingerprinted at Police Headquarters `` like anybody else. They received no special treatment whatsoever,'' said state Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, who announced the state indictment. Later, in court, the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> sat quietly in the front row as alleged drug dealers and thieves were arraigned. They spoke from time to time. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, 79, wore a brown suit and cashmere coat. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, 67, in a long red coat-dress with a blue collar, appeared depressed; her mascara had run. State prosecutors requested $ 1 million bail each for the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION>, with $ 100,000 bail for their aides. But acting state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkman </PERSON> released them on their own recognizance pending a June 1 court date. All four are due in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on April 21 for arraignment on the federal charges. The state indictment against each defendant included 139 counts of falsifying business records; 44 counts of offering a false instrument for filing; three counts of scheme to defraud; one count of conspiracy; and one misdemeanor count of scheme to defraud. The indictment said the crimes were committed between 1982 and 1986. The charges in the federal indictment include conspiracy, income tax evasion, filing false and fraudulent income tax returns, mail fraud and, for Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Turco </PERSON>, conspiracy to commit extortion. The maximum fine and prison term on conviction of the charges is unclear. Each state felony count carries with it up to four years in prison and a $ 500,000 fine; the federal counts carry sentences of up to five years in prison and fines of up to $ 250,000. The extortion conspiracy count, however, can bring up to 20 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, who is prominent in ads for a string of hotels, recently turned down a deal from prosecutors, who said they would not seek the indictment of her ailing husband if she pleaded guilty to fraud, a source has said. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, at the news conference, also congratulated the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> for its investigative reporting involving the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION>' finances The Post, over the last 15 months, ran a series of articles about the couple. As many as 30 past and current employees of the <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> organization reportedly were given immunity from prosecution in return for testimony before state and federal grand juries; <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> refused to comment on that.

 An <ORGANIZATION> Egyptian-American </ORGANIZATION> released after eight days as a hostage said the Islamic radicals who seized a <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet overlooked his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> driver's license. `` One of them searched my wallet, and there was my driver's license,'' <PERSON> Ramadan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said during an interview at the home of a relative in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> `` I was so lucky. He did n't realize what it was.'' <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> was one of 12 passengers freed Tuesday night shortly before the hijackers of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 flew from <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> with more than 30 passengers and crew still aboard. Fearful the hijackers would harm him if they knew of his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said he hid his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> passport in his briefcase and used his Egyptian documents. When the jet stopped in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> immediately after the hijacking, `` they collected al our briefcases and put them in a closet and closed it,'' he said. For the rest of his captivity, he said he worried that one might search his case and discover the document, `` but they had no time to do it.'' <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, who displayed bruises on his wrists, said the hijackers used plastic handcuffs on the passengers after two days in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and left them on constantly after that. `` Clamping your hands 24 hours _ You have to eat, your hand is tied; go the the bathroom, your hand is tied,'' he said. The eight-day ordeal left him nervous, emotionally stunned and wary of flying, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said. `` It became to me like a phobia,'' he said. `` It could happen again.'' He withheld his American address because `` these guys, they have long hands.'' <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, a consulting engineer who travels widely, said security at <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> airport was loose, `` like a farmer's market.'' He said he saw passengers who set off alarms on metal detectors pass unsearched as he was boarding the flight for <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. He agreed with other passengers' reports that the hijackers appeared to take on weapons and two new colleagues during four days at <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> airport in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, their first stop. But he said he did not actually see any weapons or new men come aboard. He said screens were drawn across the first-class cabin where the hijackers stayed and all the aircraft's window shades were pulled down. `` After we left <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION>, I saw three machine guns,'' which he said were small weapons resembling the Israeli-made Uzi. He said he also saw 10 hand grenades, thick ropes, explosives and plastic hand grenades only after the plane had been in <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION>. He said two new hijackers appeared to join the six younger ones when the plane was in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. He described the newcomers as older men, 30 to 40, who were giving orders to the others. One by one, he said, they called passengers to the front compartments to question them about their jobs, nationalities, families and religion. He said the people called forward most often were the two Kuwaitis who were shot to death in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, although passengers did not know of the killings until their release. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said the hijackers also asked the branch of Islam he belonged to: Sunni or Shiite. All of the Kuwaiti men released so far have been Shiites, members of the branch that predominates in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, but is a minority in most of the Islamic world. `` I was reading the Koran all the time. They noticed I'm a religious person,'' he said, speculating that might have helped in his release. He said he tried to pray and that others tried to join in. But he said the attempt to practice standard Islamic prayers, which require standing, then kneeling toward <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, made the hijackers nervous. `` They said, ` Hey guys, if you want to pray, pray in your seats.'''

 The violent, realistic gang drama `` Colors'' opens Friday at 425 theaters across the country amid a debate between its critics and its makers over whether the film will inspire more youth violence. A spokesman for one group of law enforcement officers says the movie will `` leave dead bodies from one end of this town to the other,'' but the filmmakers say the film is a statement of conscience and will save lives. `` This is not the right time to release a movie like this,'' said <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> City Councilman <PERSON> Nate </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON>. Since April 4, there have been 89 gang-related deaths in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> city and county; last year, there were 387 gang-related deaths in the area. `` If there is anything this picture does not do _ it does not glorify gangs or gang violence,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, executive vice president for the distributor, New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Thursday, six members of the <ORGANIZATION> Guardian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION>, a community anti-crime group, were arrested during a protest outside Orion headquarters. The group planned a protest later Thursday in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The movie, starring <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON> as gang-fighting <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> policemen, was directed by <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON> and used active area gang members as extras and advisers. The film portrays the world of the Crips and the Bloods, rival gangs, who use the colors blue and red, respectively, to distinguish themselves. It was made with the `` technical advice, assistance and cooperation of the <ORGANIZATION> LAPD </ORGANIZATION>, its anti-gang CRASH unit, the Sheriff's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Probation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said But it has drawn strong criticism from some police, city officials, the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>, community leaders and the Guardian Angels. <PERSON> Wes </PERSON> <PERSON> McBride </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, believes `` Colors'' will `` leave dead bodies from one end of this town to the other.'' `` A release of this film may tip the scale in such a way that will only result in more loss of young lives,'' said <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, president of the Beverly Hills-Hollywood <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> chapter. `` I think the people who are making those predictions are whipping up the probability and the possibility,'' of violence, <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON> said. `` The people who are saying blood is going to flow in the streets are asking for blood to flow in the streets. I think it's very irresponsible behavior.'' About 70 theaters in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area alone plan to show `` Colors.'' Many critics called on theaters to cancel the movie. The downtown Laemmle Grand did just that. `` The staff at the theater were in a panic because the home turf of one of the gangs in the movie is just a couple of miles from downtown,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Laemmle </PERSON>, theater chain co-owner. But <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Maliniak </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` Officials should be finding solutions to the gang problem rather than prohibiting something from being shown.'' District Attorney <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON> said he believes the movie will galvanize support for the county's war on gangs. At a celebrity showing Wednesday night, which drew <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marlee </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bono </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Estevez </PERSON>, 10 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Guardian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> marched and chanted `` Do n't Show ` Colors.''' `` There is nothing in this film that glorifies being in a gang,'' said <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON>, who also attended the VIP showing. Five Guardian Angels were arrested Tuesday when they tried to force their way into <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> offices. The Angels, including group founder <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON> who has called the movie `` racist and irresponsible,'' were arrested for investigation of battery after allegedly pushing and tackling security guards. `` We feel that ` Colors' is an honest and socially responsible portrayal of a problem that obviously exists in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and in the streets of every other American city,'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said. He called `` Colors'' a `` significant work by filmmakers of substance and integrity,'' and likened it to statement movies made in the past, including `` Gentleman's Agreement'' about anti-Semitism, `` I Am a Fugitive from A Chain Gang'' about legal injustice, `` Platoon'' about the futility of combat and `` On the Waterfront'' about waterfront gangs.

 Stock prices and the dollar plunged and interest rates shot higher today after an unexpected bulge in the trade deficit sent shock waves through the financial markets. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped about 101 points, while in the currency markets the value of the dollar fell 2 percent against major currencies. Interest rates on a key long-term <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond jumped to a three-month high. Traders scrambled to sell dollars, bonds and stocks after the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported this morning that the nation's trade deficit had risen to $ 13.8 billion in February. That was the biggest shortfall since the record of $ 17.6 billion in October and the second monthly increase in a row. Many economists had been expecting the deficit to narrow. The Dow Jones industrials tumbled 35 points within 20 minutes of the opening bell on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> then stabilized for a few hours. But the slide resumed in the afternoon and the average skidded to a 101.46-point loss at 2,005.63, a 4.8 percent drop, according to a prelimary calculation. It was the worst decline since the Dow plunged 140.58 points on Jan. 8. The Dow's decline triggered a ban on the use of a form of computerized program trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the first time the `` collar'' has been triggered by a decline of 50 points or more in the Dow. The dollar was down about 1.9 percent against the British pound, about 1.9 percent against the West German mark and about 2.2 percent against the Japanese yen at midafternoon. The impact also was felt in the bond market, an important barometer of the economy and interest rates. By late afternoon, prices of the key 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond were down 1 \ points, or about $ 12.50 for every $ 1,000 in face amount, and its yield, which moves inversely to price, surged to 8.855 percent, the highest in three months

 Conservatives opened a drive against the new U.S.-Soviet arms treaty on Thursday and former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> said he had no reason to believe the pact bans futuristic weapons such as lasers. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, vowed once more not to call up the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty for debate on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor until the futuristic weapons issue is cleared The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> convened a secret session to discuss the issue, which <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> has said may represent `` a hole in the treaty.'' Although there has been pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to complete work on the pact before President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves for his <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit meeting with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in late May, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> told reporters: `` I'm not driven by a calendar deadline. I want first, last and always to have a good treaty.'' The treaty makes no specific mention of futuristic weapons such as lasers or particle beam generators that may be used in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Star Wars defense, but <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration negotiators have said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> understands the treaty does bar the possession or flight testing of all medium-range weapons, no matter how they are armed or operate. <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, in a letter, told Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, R-Ind.: `` I can simply state that there was no understanding of any kind that I knew about that the treaty covered anything related to these so-called futuristic weapons.'' A similar letter was received from <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Adelman </PERSON>, former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> said: `` Certainly, there was no discussion or evaluation of the military sufficiency questions involved in banning futuristic weaponry that I ever participated in, and I never heard any others having such a discussion.'' He said it was his clear understanding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators were talking only about existing types of medium-range ballistic or cruise missiles. `` Indeed, had their been any suggestions that ` futuristic' weapons were banned, I would have opposed it in the strongest possible terms, because it would have had an obvious adverse effect on -LRB- the Strategic Defense Initiative -RRB- for us to agree to any limitation on any systems not yet designed or ` futuristic' systems,'' <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> He said such a ban also would heve enabled the Soviets `` to argue that they have finally succeeded in making our SDI efforts ineffective.'' <PERSON> Adelman </PERSON> also said he was never aware of a ban on futuristic weapons ever being discussed in any <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting he attended or in `` any meeting with Soviet officials with which I am familiar.'' Meanwhile, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, announced the opening of a nationwide campaign to defeat the treaty or to delay <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> consent to its ratification. Treaty supporters have said they can count only a handful of senators firmly committed to vote against the pact. Ratification requires a two-thirds vote, 67 senators if all 100 are present. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> told reporters that black umbrellas emblazoned with anti-treaty slogans would be delivered to the offices of all 100 senators to symbolize the beginning of a campaign in which he said organizers would attempt to rally public opinion against the pact. In a letter accompanying the umbrellas, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> gave this explanation: `` Open, the unbrella symbolizes the protective shield which, for more than four decades, has prevented Soviet domination and intimidation of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` Closed, the umbrella today symbolizes the spirit of appeasement and the lack of resolve which characterized -LRB- <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister -RRB- <PERSON> Neville </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON>'s dealings with <PERSON> Adolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> precisely 50 years ago.'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said conservative groups would purchase television time to present a 30-minute film attacking the treaty and were sending letters to 250,000 conservative activists to begin a grassroots campaign. The INF treaty requires the destruction of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet missiles with a range of between 300 miles and 3,400 miles. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> force of Pershing 2 ballistic missiles and ground-launched cruise missiles was deployed several years ago to counter the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> deployment of medium-range SS-20 missiles.

 <PERSON> Lior </PERSON>, a 13-year-old Israeli, and <PERSON> Salam </PERSON>, a 12-year-old Palestinian, did n't agree on much, but an editor who published their letter exchange in his newspaper said it was the start of a fresh dialogue. `` If our generation failed to communicate, maybe this young generation can do a better job,'' said <PERSON> Othman </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallak </PERSON>, editor of the An Nahar newspaper. <PERSON> Hallak </PERSON> is known for his moderate pro-Jordanian views. An Nahar on Wednesday published a two-page missive by <PERSON> Lior </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> who called for an end to rioting, criticized <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> extremism and asked <LOCATION> Palestnian </LOCATION> children to write to him. In response, the newspaper received several letters from Arab children and phone calls from interested Israelis, <PERSON> Hallak </PERSON> said. One Arab youth, 12-year-old <PERSON> Salam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeidat </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, appealed for an end to violence by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s army. His letter is to be published Friday. In his letter Wednesday, the first by an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> to be published in <LOCATION> An </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nahar </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> wrote: `` I like the Palestinian people, and I understand the reason of your anger, which is your refusal of the occupation, and which is your right to refuse live under it. `` Through your newspaper, I'm asking the representatives of the Palestinian people and the Palestinian children to stop violence and start negotiations. `` I want to point out that extremists among your people were a reason for right-wing extremists among our people. Your rejection of the occupation does not have to harm the Israeli children, and pregnant women ... `` You have the historical right and we also a historical right ...,'' <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> wrote. Responded <PERSON> Obeidat </PERSON>: `` I reject the occupation because it stole my land, my freedom and my school.'' `` I do n't think when I ask for my freedom and my state that I am commiting a violent act or being an extremist. If you, <PERSON> Lior </PERSON>, were a Palestinian boy I think you probably would have fought the occupation as the Palestinian kids are fighting.'' `` We are not the reason for your suffering, <PERSON> Lior </PERSON>. This is not our fault. But you are the reason of our suffering. This is your fault.'' <PERSON> Obeidat </PERSON> said Israelis who returned to their ancient homeland had not been considerate of the Palestinians living on the same land. `` When you came back to live beside us what is the gift which you brought for me, an airplane, a tank, a gun and tear gas bombs? Is that a peaceful offering from a peaceful child, <PERSON> Lior </PERSON>? `` I am asking the Jews ... to quit using physical force, weapons and tear gas which kills love and peace and innocents like me and like you.'' `` This is the only way to build the bridges for peace and love between our nations and to build a peaceful state.''

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declined Thursday to criticize <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, saying it would be `` a little arrogant'' for him to assail a potential Democratic presidential rival at this point in the campaign. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, apparently on his way to the Republican nomination, would not bite at reporters' questions about whether he agreed with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s assertion on Wednesday that some people are reluctant to criticize <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> because he is black. `` I have n't started punching any of the Democrats,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied when questioned during a picture-taking session with Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> at the White House. A day before, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who has remained officially neutral in the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> presidential race, took a swipe at <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a major contender for the Democratic nomination. Answering a question during his appearance before the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he hoped that `` race will not be a part of this campaign in any way.'' `` I have to believe that a great many of us would find ourselves in great disagreement with the policies that he -LRB- <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> -RRB- is proposing, and would perhaps be more vocal about them if it was n't for concern that that be misinterpreted into some kind of racial attack,'' the president said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that his preference was to `` wait until there is one slow-moving target out there.'' `` And I have decided that it would be a little arrogant, somewhat presumptuous, to involve myself in the Democratic side of this thing,'' the vice president said. `` They're working hard. I give them credit for that,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I'm trying to do the same thing myself on our side, and we would have been quite resentful if any one of them had started singling out a Republican for criticism. That's what the general election is about.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` there will be plenty of time for that. So I've not been involved in going after <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> or <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> or <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> or the others.'' `` You'll see a hard-hitting, tough in my view, close election in the fall,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` But the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are going to have a clear choice. The issues that they are running on or the philosophy that they are running on are quite different than what I'll be running on.'' Later, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with former former <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, who dropped out of the presidential race in February. In response to questions, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would make no decisions about a running mate until after the Democratic convention. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> said he would consider accepting the spot if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> offered it, but added, `` It is very difficult to directly change things as vice president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.''

 With $ 234,000 already in hand, a `` flabbergasted'' radio station staff on Thursday continued counting loot that poured in after a disc jockey asked listeners to send $ 20 checks without saying what he would do with the money. `` We never promised anybody anything,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, a KVIL-FM disc jockey. `` That's the joy of this. We just said send the money. We've got a back room full of people -LRB- counting money -RRB-. `` We're absolutely stunned. We're flabbergasted.'' <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said he asked his audience to send him money on March 31 as an experiment. After his first request, 4,000 checks for $ 20 each arrived in the mail the next day. On the following Monday, an additional 5,000 checks arrived, a flood so heavy that <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> went on the air to say, `` OK, folks: that's it. Do n't send any more checks after today.'' The station has n't decided yet what to do. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said it initially planned to return the checks, possibly with $ 2 interest and a T-shirt, but now is thinking about using it for a special event. The station is keeping contributors' names in a computer file, <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said. `` You've got to be careful. You've got to be real up front with them, especially with their money,'' he said. `` People have been angry that we wo n't let them send in more.'' <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Blumberg </PERSON>, supervisor of investigations in the mass media division of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said there is nothing illegal about such a solicitation. `` As long as they do n't make any promises or say they'll spend the money one way and then spend it on something else, there does n't sound to be anything fraudulent about that,'' he said. `` There's nothing wrong with saying, ` Send us your money.''' Some contributors confirmed <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>'s belief that listeners trusted <ORGANIZATION> KVIL </ORGANIZATION> to handle their money. `` They seem to be legit,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Steel </PERSON>, 40, of suburban <PERSON> Burleson </PERSON>. `` I would n't do that for just anything. I do n't have the money.'' Ms. <PERSON> Steel </PERSON> also said she was used to participating in contests sponsored by the station with cash rewards. Last month, <ORGANIZATION> KVIL </ORGANIZATION> broadcast serial numbers of dollar bills and awarded $ 10,000 to a person holding a matching bill. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, who has offered to return listeners' checks on demand, said the station has received a steady stream of suggestions from listeners about what to do with the money. Ms. <PERSON> Steel </PERSON> said she planned to request $ 80,000 to send her daughter's high school drill team to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>, 39, a contributor from <LOCATION> Plano </LOCATION>, had another suggestion: `` Multiply it times a million and send it back to me.''

<HEAD>State Wants to Block Book, Movie Profits for Gilbert's Lawyer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s attorney general asked a court Thursday to bar a former lawyer for <PERSON> Roswell </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, convicted of murdering his ailing wife in a so-called mercy killing, from spending book and movie profits that form part of his legal fees. Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> cited <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s so-called `` Son of Sam'' law in a petition to the <ORGANIZATION> Broward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> is seeking a lien against $ 45,000 allegedly received by <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Varon </PERSON> for an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> television movie, `` Mercy or Murder?,'' about the killing, and any other profits from films or books. <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> also wants an injunction barring expenditure of such monies pending further investigation. `` The law says in the state of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> that a convicted felon can not profit from his crime,'' <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> said. `` When someone owes a debt to an attorney or signs over the book rights to their crime in exchange for a legal fee that is a benefit going right to the defendant who was convicted. Therefore, we are doing what we can to get the money back.'' <PERSON> Varon </PERSON> has been on an around-the-world cruise since January and is n't due back until Monday, said the secretary in his <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> law office. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, 78, a retired engineer, was convicted of first-degree murder in 1985 and is serving a life prison term for shooting his wife, <PERSON> Emily </PERSON>, in their condominium near <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>. He claimed he killed her to end her suffering from Alzheimer's disease and osteoporosis, a bone degeneration. The Son of <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> law gets its title from the nickname of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> serial murderer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkowitz </PERSON>, whose case inspired a similar law in that state. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> did not intend to block felons from profiting ... only to have defense lawyers pocket that money,'' <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> said. The law calls for 25 percent of the proceeds from any such works to go to dependents of the felon, if he has any, and 25 percent to the victims of the crime or their dependents. The state can recover prosecution, incarceration and other costs from the remaining 50 percent. State investigators have found <PERSON> Varon </PERSON> received $ 50,000 for the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> film, which was broadcast last year starring <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> as <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, and that <PERSON> Varon </PERSON> now is attempting to sell a book, <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> contends. He said the investigation showed <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> received only $ 5,000 of that amount and donated it to a non-profit institution for Alzheimer's research.

 Republican <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON>, who has criticized the extent of Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>'s out-of-state fundraising, is planning his own series of events outside <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> to raise money, a campaign spokesman said Thursday. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> is seeking re-election to a third full term in November. He is expected to easily win the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary against a little-known opponent, but face a stiff challenge from <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON>, the mayor of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. `` The mayor is going to make a prudent number of trips outside the state for fundraising, but in no way will he be able to match the pace of Sen. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON> campaign spokesman. `` We never once said we would reserve ourselves to in-state fundraising,'' <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> added. `` So I do n't see any major change in strategy. We have made it plain and clear it will take about $ 7 million for us to run a strong campaign against Sen. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>.'' In a March 31 letter mailed nationally to contributors to The Republican Senatorial Trust, a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> campaign fundraising organization, <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON> wrote that he will not let <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> `` dominate'' him in out-of-Ohio fundraising. <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON> events were set for Thursday night in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> and Friday in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Other cities where <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON> events are planned or being planned include <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> confirmed. In a campaign stop Wednesday in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON> said he will come `` nowhere near'' matching <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> in percentage of funds from outside <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. `` If he criticizes me for raising money outside <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, it will be a classic case of the pot calling the kettle black,'' <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON> had previously asked <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> to agree to a campaign spending cap of $ 5 million each. `` They did n't do it,'' <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> is expected to raise at least $ 10 million for his re-election campaign. `` We have called upon the mayor repeatedly to support the campaign finance reform act presently in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and he has refused to do so,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Butland </PERSON>, <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>'s campaign press secretary. `` That bill would also control spending by outside groups on behalf of candidates, and I do n't expect the mayor would like that.'' According to <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> reports filed earlier this year, about 70 percent of <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>'s campaign funds had come from outside <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Butland </PERSON> said that when the next round of <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> reports are filed, the percentage of <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> funds coming from out-of-state will have `` reduced substantially.''

 <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, the assistant secretary of state who has been persona non grata in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> since it was revealed he lied about secret <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to resupply <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contra rebels, has made peace with the panel's chairman. In a letter to Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> apologized for `` misleading'' testimony he gave the committee on Oct. 10, 1986. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> noted in a March 31 letter to <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> that he previously had apologized to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for similar inaccurate responses to questions about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in a private Contra aid network and about enlisting foreign governments to aid the rebels. Recalling the Foreign Relations hearing, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said, `` My testimony that day covered much of this same territory, and accordingly, I want to offer you and through you the members of the committee the same apology.'' On Wednesday, <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> sent a two-sentence letter to <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> saying, `` Your apology is accepted'' and concluding: `` I look forward to your working again with the committee on important Latin American issues.'' During last year's Iran-Contra hearings, it was disclosed that <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>' testimony had been wrong.

<HEAD>Arizona Democrats To Pick Candidates In Saturday Vote</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> political news has been dominated recently by the ouster of Republican Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, but Democrats will reclaim the spotlight, at least temporarily, with presidential caucuses on Saturday. The outcome is viewed as a tossup between <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has lined up endorsements from key Democrats, and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, whose firmly committed supporters may be more likely to turn out at the caucuses. `` I think we can win <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> coordinator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> said Thursday, `` because people committed to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> tend to be more apt to go out and vote.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, meanwhile, has been gaining endorsements from the likes of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Volgy </PERSON>, and a number of state lawmakers and local government officials. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign spokesman <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Villarreal </PERSON> said the endorsements were significant `` because these are all very well-known and respected individuals.'' <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s caucuses begin the process of alloting 36 national convention delegates _ a mere blip compared to the 255 at stake in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s primary on Tuesday. The caucuses resemble a primary in that voters merely cast their ballots and leave. But there are only 99 polling places statewide _ far fewer than the 1,932 regular voting precincts _ which means <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> must find out where to vote and travel farther. Voters will make two choices: a presidential preference and a delegate ballot. `` <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is at a distinct advantage under this kind of a system,'' <PERSON> Villarreal </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, which has a similar voting process. The only objective indicator of support is a survey several weeks old that showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as the choice of 36 percent, compared to 17 percent for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and 4 percent for <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> Jr. But the poll had a small sample and did not screen for likely voters. `` I think it's anybody's race at this point,'' said one <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporter, state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>. `` I think Arizonans are just now focusing on this primary. They've been consumed with the <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> trial.'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, a Republican, was removed from office on April 4 by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> impeachment court. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporter Sen. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> predicted her candidate will win, adding, `` I think the die-hard <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters are going to find their way out -LRB- to the polls -RRB-. I kind of feel a little bit in that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> takes <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> for granted.'' The new governor, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, is a Democrat, but has not endorsed any of the candidates. Former Gov. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, who dropped out of the 1988 race in February, appeared with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at a rally last week but did not endorse him. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign has done no advertising, while <PERSON> Villarreal </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has spent only about $ 1,500 on radio ads statewide. Blacks make up less than 10 percent of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s population. The state keeps no statistics on what percentage of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s 1.58 million registered voters are minorities. State party executive director <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said he expected only 25,000 to 30,000 of the state's registered 683,000 Democrats to vote Saturday. `` That's why I think <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> can win here because he's well organized and his people will go vote,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. Only registered Democrats can vote but the party says it will have registrars on hand to register new voters.

 Gunmen holding a hijacked <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> jetliner at <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> airport released one of their hostages today as negotiations to end the 10-day-old crisis appeared to intensify. A man dressed in a white robe came down the stairs of the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 at 9:45 p.m. -LRB- 4:45 p.m. EDT -RRB-, got into a car and was driven rapidly across the tarmac to the VIP lounge at <LOCATION> Houari </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boumedienne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The freed hostage, who was not immediately identified, was greeted by <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> officials and hustled inside the building. Earlier in the day, a passenger aboard the plane pleaded with his government to meet the gunmen's demands, saying if it did n't, all aboard the plane would be killed. Algerian mediators and the Shiite Moslem hijackers resumed their talks for the release of the remaining passengers and crew aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 after a suspension earlier in the day. The hijackers have demanded that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> free 17 pro-Iranian extremists convicted of terrorism. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> has rejected the demand. The plane was commandeered April 5 on a Bangkok-Kuwait flight with 112 people aboard. It was first diverted to <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, where 57 people were freed. It went on to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, where two hostages were killed and 13 released, and flew to <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> on Tuesday. The hijackers, thought to number five to eight, are armed with grenades and guns and have threatened to blow up the plane and kill their hostages. A passenger told the control tower today by radio, `` My name is <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zayed </PERSON>.'' His words were monitored by reporters. `` Hello. Hello to my family. I am in good health. I ask the government to release the 17 Islamic Jihad prisoners. If not, they will kill us all.'' The talks had reached an impasse on Wednesday. A ranking Algerian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s `` intransigence'' had created the standstill. A Cypriot official said the jet was refueled and allowed to leave <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> only after <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> gave assurances that the remaining passengers would be freed on arrival there. `` Our objective all along was the safe release of the hostages. We believed we had succeeded in this when the hijackers released ... hostages here, with the rest to be freed in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, according to the Algerian assurance,'' government spokesman <PERSON> Akis </PERSON> <PERSON> Fantis </PERSON> said. There are believed to be about 32 Arab passengers and four crew members aboard the plane. Three passengers are members of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s large royal family Two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen Wednesday asked Secretary of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to intervene with the negotiators because one of the hijackers may also have kidnapped Americans being held hostage in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Slaughter </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, cited a report in the independent <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> newspaper al-Qabas that said one of the Kuwaiti jet hijackers may be <PERSON> Imad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mughniyeh </PERSON>. They said <PERSON> Mughniyeh </PERSON> may have been the chief kidnapper of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hostage <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> was kidnapped in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on May 16, 1985, and is the longest held of 22 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. His abductors also have demanded that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> release the 17 pro-Iranian extremists. Al-Qabas quoted unidentified sources as saying <PERSON> Mughniyeh </PERSON> was believed to have boarded the plane when it stopped in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. This morning, the blue-and-white plane was moved to the end of a runway at <LOCATION> Houari </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boumedienne </LOCATION> airport to permit the safe landing of a plane carrying Zambian President <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON>, who arrived on a state visit. Algerian President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON>, before greeting <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON>, met briefly with <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Osaimi </PERSON>, deputy foreign minister of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. The president was given a message from <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> Emir <PERSON> Shiek </PERSON> <PERSON> Jabar </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>, according to <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> radio, monitored by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. No details were provided. A newspaper in <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhabi </PERSON> said today that an agreement had been reached for the release of the Kuwaiti hostages. Al-Ittihad, quoting unidentified diplomatic sources in <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, said `` an agreement was signed by hijackers, <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> and Algerian officials, for releasing passengers and hijackers in <LOCATION> Algerias </LOCATION> in exchanging for reducing sentences against the 17 persons in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> jails.'' The 17 jailed in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> were convicted for the Dec. 1983 bombings of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies there. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s defense minister, Sheikh <PERSON> Nawaf </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON>, on Wednesday affirmed his country's `` unwavering and principled stance of rejecting blackmail,'' <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s news agency reported. Food and water were taken Wednesday afternoon to the jet, which the hijackers call the `` plane of martyrdom.''

 Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is running out of plans for ousting <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> ruler Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and is doing little to enlist neighboring countries to turn up the pressure. `` Some of us on the committee feel strongly that we must get more support from other Latin American countries so it does not seem as if it's a direct confrontation between <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, the committee chairman. <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> and others attended a briefing by <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials on the situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> during which possible further economic sanctions against the country were outlined, as well as several top-secret, non-economic options. `` Mr. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is getting stronger every day that we do nothing,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, the ranking <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> member of the committee. `` He's getting more arms from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, while we're sitting here talking about what we've done for the banks,'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said in reference to economic sanctions already in place. Sen. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON>, R-Kan., said there was a consensus among those at the briefing that `` it is terribly important, although difficult, to get our Latin American allies to step forward and play a role ... As much as they do n't want <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in power, it's difficult for them to stand up and be counted in a visible way. <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> said that as the weeks wear on and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> remains in place, the more the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> risks a backlash from the economic sanctions because of the suffering the sanctions cause for Panamanian citizens. `` It will begin to turn on us and we'll be blamed,'' she said. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration `` has been sending divided signals'' that prolong <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s tenure `` There is no evidence of a major diplomatic effort'' reaching out to other Central American leaders or to the internal opposition inside <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said. `` The way to avoid the use of troops is to pursue these other measures.'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, sent a letter to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asking that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy give greater emphasis to the common hemispheric interest in combatting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug charges, and has been accused of turning his country into a haven for drug traffickers. `` I believe it is time for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to stop going it alone and to place this serious problem of General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and drug dealing before the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. That theme was taken up by Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> during an appearance Thursday before the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION>. `` If you act unilaterally in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, you'll be isolated,'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy. `` You need to get support from the rest of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said, adding, `` If you want to punish <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, economic sanctions is not the best answer. You are then punishing the Panamanian people but not General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.'' He said the conflict in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> can only be resolved through negotiations.

<TEXT>
 A mail-order minister who claimed his religious position made his stop-smoking clinics exempt from licensing requirements has been arrested and accused of fabricating a plot against city officials, police said. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Witmer </PERSON>, 45, of <LOCATION> Clearwater </LOCATION> was charged Wednesday with threatening a public official, a felony. <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> was set at $ 50,000 and <PERSON> Witmer </PERSON> remained in the <LOCATION> Pinellas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> on Thursday. He had told police that members of his `` religious cult'' planned to kill three city officials because of his dispute over the license. Police, who put the three officials in protective custody, eventually concluded there was no such cult and no such plot, said Capt. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Glover </PERSON>. According to investigators, <PERSON> Witmer </PERSON> claimed that he unwittingly released $ 6,000 to his followers with which they planned to buy weapons. In reality, police said, <PERSON> Witmer </PERSON> hatched the plot and the phone call `` tip-off'' to police in order to frighten licensing officials who refused to honor his bid for religious exemption. <PERSON> Witmer </PERSON> told police he has a doctorate degree from the <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Modesto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a mail-order outfit that once ordained a dog, investigators said in a statement. Several years ago, <PERSON> Witmer </PERSON> was convicted of extortion and sentenced to two years in prison after another dispute involving the smoking clinics, but that conviction was reversed on appeal. `` I just hope this -LRB- arrest -RRB- will put a stop to Mr. <PERSON> Witmer </PERSON>'s method of attempting to intimidate people and use threats to get his own way,'' <PERSON> Glover </PERSON> said Wednesday `` We are going to ask for restitution. At one point or another everybody in this division has worked on this case this past week.'' <PERSON> Witmer </PERSON> has been at odds with <LOCATION> Clearwater </LOCATION> officials since 1985, when an occupational license for his UFS Stop-Smoking Clinic first became an issue, according to a police affidavit. He conducts the clinics at various hotels. <PERSON> Witmer </PERSON> obtained the license in previous years. But he refused to renew it this year, claiming he was exempt because of his religious status. The city would not recognize a religious exemption. On April 4, <PERSON> Witmer </PERSON> called police and said three members of what he described as his own `` religious cult'' planned to kill or seriously injure city officials because they believed that the city was harassing <PERSON> Witmer </PERSON>. He said he unwittingly helped the plot by releasing $ 6,000 to the conspirators. <PERSON> Witmer </PERSON> promised to try to stop his followers from harming city officials, but he refused to identify them until he was held in contempt of court April 6. On the way to jail, <PERSON> Witmer </PERSON> named the `` conspirators.'' But the names he gave were of two <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> police officers who had contact with <PERSON> Witmer </PERSON> during one of his prior arrests. In 1976, he told the editors of a <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> campus newspaper that he would `` check into hiring a professional to rearrange your faces'' because he thought the newspaper libeled him, according to an arrest warrant. The warrant also said during 1976 he threatened the wife of a professor who told him the university would not renew his stop-smoking clinic contract. In 1979, his bid to conduct similar clinics at <ORGANIZATION> FSU </ORGANIZATION> was again turned down. He threatened to kill everyone involved with the rejection and was convicted of extortion. <PERSON> Witmer </PERSON> was sentenced to two years in prison, but an appeal court threw out the case, ruling that authorities erred in their investigation.

 Soldiers shot two Arabs dead Thursday and wounded four, including a child who lost an eye, and a 12-year-old Palestinian wrote an open letter to a Jewish boy saying the violence kills `` innocents like me and you.'' A strike called by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to protest mass arrests of Arabs virtually shut down the the occupied lands and east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, but some Palestinians have begun complaining about the economic pinch caused by repeated strikes. At least 146 Palestinians have been killed since riots began Dec. 8 in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures, and hundreds have been wounded. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier and a 15-year-old Jewish settler also have been slain. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> accused <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers of using tear gas improperly, sometimes causing deadly effects by throwing canisters into small, enclosed areas, and also indicated <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> might be using another form of toxic gas. The army denied the allegations. Hospital officials said a 70-year-old Arab woman suffocated on Wednesday after soldiers threw a tear gas canister into her home. The army said she died of natural causes. <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON> <PERSON> Obediat </PERSON>, who is 12 and lives in an Arab neighborhood of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, wrote to the Arabic-language daily <ORGANIZATION> An </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nahar </ORGANIZATION> in response to a note it published Wednesday from <PERSON> Lior </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. The 13-year-old Jewish boy had said he wanted to start a dialogue with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> children. `` You are the reason for our suffering, <PERSON> Lior </PERSON>,'' Salem's letter said. `` When you came back to live beside me, what is the gift you brought for me? An airplane, a tank, a gun and tear gas bombs. Is that a peaceful offering for a peaceful child?'' `` Quit ... using force which kills love, peace and innocents like me and you,'' <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> wrote. Israeli officials claimed Thursday that the number and size of Arab protests was declining. `` It is clear the level of violence is less but this does n't mean the uprising is over,'' said <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, an aide to Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON>, army chief of staff, said protests now involve only <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists, `` so when soldiers are forced to fire, they usually hit the inciters themselves.'' Israeli military commanders in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> held riot-control maneuvers in a deserted neighborhood of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and demonstrated a helicopter that dumps rocks onto Arab protesters. Palestinians say it has been used for at least two weeks. The most serious clash Thursday occurred in the narrow streets of the <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> central market, whose shops were closed because of the strike order. Army spokesmen said young <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> on roofs threw stones and cinder blocks at soldiers, who opened fire and killed a 24-year-old Palestinian. An official at <LOCATION> Al </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ittihad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> identified the victim as <PERSON> Wael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Asmar </PERSON> and said two other Arabs were wounded. Arab reporters said soldiers killed another <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nassar </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahmi </PERSON> <PERSON> al </PERSON> <PERSON> Lidawi </PERSON>, at the <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> market. The army confirmed the death and said it was investigating the circumstances. In nearby <LOCATION> Tulkarm </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuad </PERSON> <PERSON> Taha </PERSON>, 12, lost his right eye after being hit with a rubber bullet, said an official at <LOCATION> Rafidiyeh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. He said a 17-year-old was in critical condition with a stomach wound. At <LOCATION> Tekoa </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, protesters burned tires and threw stones at passing vehicles, slightly injuring two Jewish children in a bus, army radio reported. Palestinians padlocked their stores, halted buses and stayed home from jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in response to Leaflet No. 13 issued by the underground <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> leadership. `` Ramallah is a dead city,'' an Arab there said. The strike was called `` to protest the collective arrests of our people,'' the leaflet said. According to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials, nearly 5,000 Arabs have been rounded up since violence began in the territories <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. <PERSON> Farah </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Araj </PERSON>, mayor of <PERSON> Beit </PERSON> <PERSON> Jallah </PERSON>, said his city observed the strike but some Palestinians were `` feeling the seriousness of the economic strike.'' `` If no help is given to the people from outside, I think within one or two months they will get fed up,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. New questions were raised about the death of <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON>, the 15-year-old daughter of Jewish settlers who was killed April 6 in a clash with Arabs in <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town. The army said she was hit by a bullet from an M-16 rifle carried by one of two Israeli guards accompanying Miss <PERSON> Porat </PERSON> and 15 other teen-agers on a hiking trip. Army investigators said they did not know who pulled the trigger. On Thursday, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television cited a police report as saying it was not known what gun fired the shot because the bullet was not recovered. Some of the other hikers have said they saw a Palestinian point a Kalashnikov rifle at the girl.

 An underwater explosion tore open the hull of an American guided-missile frigate in the central <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and injured 10 crewmen Thursday. Pentagon sources said it appeared the warship hit a mine. The injured sailors _ six with slight burns, one with second-degree burns, one with a hernia and two with back injuries _ were evacuated from the USS <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. The <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> then began steaming slowly under its own power toward port in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>. The sailor with the second-degree burns was flown to <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said late Thursday. The other nine were transferred to the USS San Jose, a combat stores ship operating in the central gulf. Defense sources said the crew of the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> had spotted `` some mine-like objects'' in the water immediately before the 10:10 a.m. EDT explosion. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> declined official comment on the report. The sources, who insisted on anonymity, said the frigate was `` making only about two knots'' on its own power Thursday afternoon and would probably be taken under tow by the cruiser <PERSON> Wainwright </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wainwright </PERSON> are two of 14 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships assigned to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> force to provide protection to commercial ships flying the American flag. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> was in the area only because it was on a resupply mission. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration increased the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> force in the region last summer in response to a request from <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, whose oil tankers come under attack in the course of the Iran-Iraq war. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman, said the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> had been in no danger of sinking and that the crew had managed to staunch flooding in the engine compartments on its own. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> refused to attribute the explosion to a mine, saying it was premature to form a judgment. `` Underwater explosion is the way to describe it. We do n't know what caused the explosion,'' he told reporters. However, other <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials were less reticent. `` The assumption is definitely that it was a mine,'' said one source. According to <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was steaming southbound on a routine patrol Thursday morning after completing a convoy operation the night before. The frigate, which had escorted the Kuwaiti tanker Gas King northward to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> without incident, was almost dead center in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> when it was suffered the explosion _ about 70 miles to the east of a navigational bell located off the coast of <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>. The explosion `` caused flooding in the engine room and some hull damage,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. `` The flooding is under control, and the ship is in the process of pumping out the water. It's operating under auxiliary power.'' The <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, whose home port is <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, had left for <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> duty on Jan. 11 and was scheduled to leave the gulf for home around June 4, the Pentagon said. According to <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, the explosion occurred well to the south of the spot near the Iranian-controlled <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> where a reflagged Kuwaiti tanker, the <LOCATION> Bridgeton </LOCATION>, hit a mine during the first of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s convoy operation last July. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said there had been no recent reports by mine sweepers in the area that mines had been sighted. The last mine to be discovered in the gulf's waters was located on April 9 near <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION>, the Pentagon said. To date, 44 underwater mines have been destroyed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in the gulf. The <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> is the same type of guided-missile frigate as the USS Stark, the frigate that was hit last May in an Iraqi air attack. Thirty-seven crewmen died in that attack. Ships of that class normally carry a crew of about 13 officers and 190 enlisted men. The Pentagon said the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was carrying about 225 men, however, because it had a helicopter detachment aboard from <LOCATION> Mayport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had been told of the incident, which he said `` only emphasizes our concern for stopping the Iran-Iraq war. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration intended to step up pressure in the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> for a resolution that would not only put an end to the war but put the group on record in favor of sanctions against belligerents in the war.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

 Here, at a glance, are economic developments Thursday:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TRADE DEFICIT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The monthly <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit expanded by $ 1.4 billion, more than 11 percent, in February to $ 13.8 billion, its second straight rise. Imports increased $ 2.6 billion to $ 37.4 billion, led by imports of electrical equipment and auto and truck parts. Exports also rose $ 1.2 billion to $ 23.6 billion. For 1988, the deficit's annual rate is $ 157.6 billion, below the record $ 171.2 billion for 1987 but still worse than the 1986 imbalance of $ 156.2 billion.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>U.S. STOCK MARKET</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The news of the increase in the trade deficit sent the stock market reeling. The Dow Jones average fell 101.46 to 2,005.63., its worst decline since it plunged 140.58 points on Jan. 8 Analysts noted the Dow climbed nearly 130 points from April 5-12, anticipating favorable trade news. The report, they said, wiped out the basis for that rally.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DOLLAR</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The dollar plummeted against most major currencies within minutes of the trade announcement, a tailspin only partially stemmed by coordinated central bank intervention. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it cost $ 1.8755 to buy one pound, up from Wednesday's rate of $ 1.8445 In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar fell 0.30 yen to close at 126.15 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 123.60 yen.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BUSINESS INVENTORIES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Growth of business inventories slowed in February, increasing by only $ 825 million, or 0.1 percent. The small gain followed a string of steep increases after the stock market crash. The February inventory increase occurred while business sales climbed 0.6 percent, reversing a 0.5 percent drop in January.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>RETAIL SALES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Retail sales rose 0.8 percent in March, the government reported Wednesday, increasing by a seasonally adjusted $ 1.1 billion to $ 130.7 billion. It was the fifth consecutive monthly increase and the largest since December, when sales shot up 1.1 percent. The combination of rising sales and slightly rising inventories pushed the inventory to sales ratio down from 1.54 in January to 1.53 in February. That means it would take 1.53 months to exhaust inventories at the February sales pace. That ratio is not considered abnormally high.

<HEAD>Medical Ethicists Call for Caution in Using Doomed Infants as
Organ Donors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Infants born with only a fraction of a normal brain should not be immediately used as a source of donor organs even though they are doomed, say two medical ethicists who argue that doctors must wait for true `` brain death'' to occur. Such infants, called anencephalics, have a brain stem, which enables them to breathe. But they have no cerebral cortex, the part of the brain that allows thought and voluntary movement. Most die within 24 hours and all within weeks of birth, and they are increasingly viewed by some within the medical community as a potential pool of donor organs for children needing transplants. At issue is both the appropriateness of using anencephalics as donors _ and how soon. `` Organ donation is very laudable and people say these kids will inevitably die,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Shlomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinnar </PERSON>, co-author with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Arras </PERSON> of a commentary in Friday's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` But then what makes that different from a number of newborns with congential fatal diseases? Or other kids and adults in vegetative states?'' <PERSON> Shinnar </PERSON> said. `` And what if there are not enough anencephalics and the transplant needs are greater two years from now? Who do we look at next? `` These are steps we can take only after very, very careful review,'' said <PERSON> Shinnar </PERSON>, a pediatric neurologist at <ORGANIZATION> Montefiore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center-Albert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Einstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. There are between 2,000 and 3,000 anencephalic infants among the 3 million children born in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> each year, the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> estimates. The problem can be detected before birth with ultrasound and abortion is considered appropriate by some doctors as late as the final three months of pregnancy, the commentary said. `` Should we be encouraging pregnant women, in essence, to carry these children to term to provide spare parts?'' <PERSON> Shinnar </PERSON> said. Questions about their use as organ donors were raised after newspaper reports last October that organs had been taken from anencephalic infants and transplanted into other children in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` In the West German case, they took a baby from delivery, put a tube -LRB- of oxygen -RRB- in its mouth, took it to the operating room, harvested the organs and buried it,'' said <PERSON> Shinnar </PERSON>. `` And in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, although it did not pass, there was a bill in the legislature in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to have these children declared ` brain-dead' at birth,'' he added. <PERSON> Shinnar </PERSON> said legal definitions of brain death used in making medical determinations require an end of all brain functions, including those of the brain stem. The debate took a new turn in December, when the <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linda </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> developed guidelines under which anencephalic babies are to be sustained on respirators and used for transplants only if brain death occurs within a week. Otherwise, they are removed from the respirators and allowed to die naturally. Six anencephalic infants have been kept alive by respirator for a week under those guidelines, though none ultimately became an organ donor, said <PERSON> Loma </PERSON> <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON>. `` We wrote our article before the protocol -LRB- guideline -RRB- was developed,'' said <PERSON> Shinnar </PERSON>, `` and this certainly lessens the magnitude of the ethical debate. `` We are no longer talking about actively taking a life, though this protocol is not without its problems as well. What about extending the tragedy for the parents of an anencephalic child?'' he said. `` The issue is not that the practice is common, because it's not,'' he said `` But the argument over whether this is a good, sound idea or something that should be opposed _ as we feel _ has to take place before it becomes so.''

<TEXT>
 The head of the West German central bank said Thursday that his country has done all it can to stimulate its own economy as part of the effort to lower the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. `` We have the lowest interest rates in the world ... and it would be irresponsible to pursue more expansionary monetary policies,'' <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> luncheon. His remarks came amid turmoil on world financial markets. The dollar fell and stocks tumbled in reaction to news that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit for February widened by more than 11 percent to $ 13.8 billion. A heated dispute over interest rates last year between <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and the West Germans has been cited as one of the contributing factors to Oct. 19 stock market plunge. Since that time, world financial leaders have gone out of their way to stress harmony and coordinated efforts. With <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> looking on, <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON> sidestepped questions at the luncheon about whether the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> should tighten the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> money supply, which would drive up interest rates and make the dollar more attractive. However, he said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, by keeping its interest rates low, `` could n't have done more.'' <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>'s dollar reserves have increased by $ 15 billion in the past year to $ 50 billion and indicated it was among the central banks intervening Thursday to buy dollars on world exchange markets. `` Today was a day where, I think, we have demonstrated to the markets our readiness, and our willingness ... in the future,'' he said. <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON> cautioned against overreacting to Thursday's trade deficit figures. `` One should not be confused by a monthly trade figure. That's a very temporary statistic. The true conditions for more stable exchange rates are much better than some years ago,'' he said. He also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not expect to be in equilibrium with every trading partner all the time. He said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, as an aging nation with a stable population, needs to be a net exporter. <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which was $ 2.2 billion in the first two months of this year, is far smaller than <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s, at $ 8.5 billion, and less than <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s, at $ 2.7 billion, he said.

<HEAD>Farmland Prices Rise for First Time Since 1982</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Farmland prices are up for the first time in six years but still are far from returning to the peak levels of 1982, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. As of Feb. 1, the average value of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farmland, including buildings, was $ 564 per acre, up 3 percent from a 19-year low of $ 548 per acre recorded last year, the department said in its annual report. But the Feb. 1 reading was still down 32 percent from the record high of $ 823 per acre in 1982. In real terms, allowing for an inflation of nearly 4 percent last year, farmland nationally dropped again to an average of $ 288 per acre, down 1 percent from $ 290 a year earlier. That would be the lowest since the early 1960s. Farmland values vary greatly across the country, and not all regions or states share in the increase. More than a dozen states showed a further decline or no gain from a year ago. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Hexem </PERSON>, a farmland analyst in the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said there are too many variables _ interest rates and farm income estimates, for example _ to make a prediction of a future trend. `` It do n't think it necessarily follows that they're going to be higher next year,'' <PERSON> Hexem </PERSON> said in an interview. `` I think there are just too many uncertainties.'' <PERSON> Hexem </PERSON> added: `` We just ca n't put ourselves into the minds of those who are looking at the markets. One's expectation of what's going to happen in terms of returns to the land are kind of peculiar to that individual And if that individual is more optimistic than others, then he or she is probably more inclined to get into the market and bid prices up.'' The report, which <PERSON> Hexem </PERSON> supervised, noted that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm income was a record high in 1987, but `` was enhanced by government payments equivalent to nearly 30 percent of net cash income.'' Higher farm income and lower debt improved the equity position of farmers in 1987, and interest rates averaged lower than in 1986. However, those rates edged up slightly late last year, the report said. Regionally, the <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> showed a 9 percent increase in farmland prices as of Feb. 1, continuing an upward trend that began in the mid-1940s, the report said. The Corn Belt also rose 9 percent, and the <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plains </ORGANIZATION> averaged 7 percent higher, the first advances since the early 1980s. `` In both regions, values rose in all states, particularly <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> -LRB- up 19 percent -RRB-,'' the report said. `` <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s 14 percent gain led the Lake States' 7 percent growth, while values were up 6 percent in the Southeast and 2 percent in <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION>.'' A 4 percent drop in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> farmland values was offset by higher prices in other states, which left the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> states essentially unchanged for the year. `` The upturns in farmland values did not extend to the Western regions, where most state values continued downward into 1988,'' the report said. `` Regional values were down 3 percent in the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plains </ORGANIZATION>, 2 percent in the Mountain states and 2 percent in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> region. But the rates of decline were lower than in the past two years.''

 An car-bomb explosion ripped through a club for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> today, killing five people, Italian authorities said.

Each of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s 341 <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents is being issued a 9mm Colt submachine gun as well as a 15-shot 9mm sidearm as their primary, personal weapons, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hook </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> office. Until now, <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents have gone into battle carrying six-shot, .38 - caliber handguns and All 3,000 <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents nationwide will get the increased firepower as soon as possible, <PERSON> Hook </PERSON> said. `` The managers of <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> are sick and tired of burying dead <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents who have been killed in gunfights by traffickers who have outgunned those agents,'' <PERSON> Hook </PERSON> said, noting that five agents have been killed nationally in the last 14 months. The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> is the first federal agency to issue submachine guns routinely. Customs and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents still carry .38 - and .357 - caliber weapons, He said agents in cities such as <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with big drug problems are slated to get the guns first. He said the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> division is the first to receive the weapons, although agents protecting witnesses in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> for the trial of reputed drug lord <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Caraballo </PERSON> of the governor's task force on immigration. Those workers picked two-thirds of the crop. `` The fear growers have in strawberries is that you need to replace those 17,000 with about 35,000 people to get the same production you had before,'' he said.

 The counselor to Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> on Thursday said Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> and two other <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> opponents of former <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> had adopted a `` personal litmus test'' in rejecting <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>'s nomination. `` What clearly emerged during the spectacle of the Judge's confirmation hearings was nothing less than an arrogant disdain for government by the people,'' Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said in remarks prepared for delivery to a lawyers group Thursday night in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, who as counselor to the attorney general is <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s top aide, said <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., and other <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> opponents had decided last year that `` the only relevant consideration'' in <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>'s confirmation proceedings `` was a purely That consideration, <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said, was whether <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>'s views on privacy, free speech and equal protection coincide with the policy positions `` crafted and fed to the Senators by largely hostile staffers in collaboration with various interest'' groups. `` Such an inquisition makes a mockery of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s constitutional responsibility,'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said `` There can be little doubt that the framers -LRB- of the Constitution -RRB- never intended for that legislative ` check' to permit judicial nominees to be held hostage to each senator's personal litmus test.'' He said Republican Sens. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, as well as <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, had adopted the `` result-oriented'' approach in the <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> fight.

 A federal grand jury on Thursday questioned two members of the <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> family which arranged to pay the wife of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> while leasing office space to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for $ 50 million. The panel, under the direction of independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, is investigating whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has violated federal law through any conflict between his personal financial interests and his government duties. Accompanied by his attorney, <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Glanzer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> arrived at the grand jury Thursday morning. His wife, <PERSON> Sondra </PERSON>, arrived at mid-afternoon. He spent more than three hours behind closed doors. Later, Mrs. <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> was questioned separately for about an hour. Meanwhile, trustees of the <ORGANIZATION> Multiple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sclerosis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that they never voted on the plan to hire <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> at $ 40,000 a year with money donated by the <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> family foundation. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday that a partnership headed by <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> won a $ 50-million lease on <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> offices after the <ORGANIZATION> Bender </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> put up money to pay Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s salary at the MS society. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to attend a drug conference, was asked by a reporter about the matter but declined to comment. During a stop later at an Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Nationalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> center in <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, he turned aside several questions about the lease arrangement, saying `` that's not on the subject of immigration.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Thursday that he knew nothing about the lease but that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` still has full confidence in <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>.'' MS officials have said that the <ORGANIZATION> Bender </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, of which <PERSON> Sondra </PERSON> is president, donated the money in October 1985 to pay Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> for three years. Mrs. <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> are MS trustees. Several MS trustees said they first learned about that arrangement from newspaper accounts in the last two weeks. Others, however, said the board had been advised earlier. Some trustees complained about not hearing earlier, but others saw no reason for concern. Some acknowledged it was an unusual arrangement, and all agreed it was not put up for a board vote. MS Trustee <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON>, wife of Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON>, D-Minn., said she first learned about Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s salary when her husband read it in a newspaper March 30 and told her She said the issue was never discussed in any board meeting that she attended. Another trustee, <PERSON> Remmel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON>, gave a different version. `` I guess you might say it was reported to the board,'' said <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON>. `` I can not say that a proposal was put before the board, discussed pro and con and then a vote was taken, but we were informed that this had been proposed. `` I was pleased. I was told the Benders had this foundation and they could make a contribution to MS or pay for someone's salary or designate for a specific purpose. We were delighted to know she -LRB- Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> -RRB- would be a full-time employee because she's a worker.'' The board meets quarterly and not all the trustees attend each meeting. Attorney <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Barkley </PERSON>, also a trustee, said, `` I do n't recall a discussion at a board meeting about'' the plan to hire Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. He said, `` It is not normal to earmark a grant for the salary of a specific person. That's a little unusual.'' But he added, `` It's not necessarily something the board would get into to vote on or ratify. Another long-time trustee, who spoke on condition she not be identified, said she never missed a meeting but, `` When I read the article in the paper, I was shocked ... I was aghast when I saw it.'' She said she had no idea Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was paid as MS development director and thought the attorney general's wife served solely on the board as a volunteer. MS society attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bierbower </PERSON> said the arrangement was brought up in October 1985 at a special meeting to discuss expansion of Operation Job Match, a program to help MS victims find work. Mrs. <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> was at the session, he said. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> has subpoenaed records of Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s job at the society. He also is known to be interested in a $ 50-million lease renewal won by a partnership headed by <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> after Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> got her job. Most of the offices in the lease were occupied by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which had complained about the building's maintenance, size, location and security. Renewal of the lease in May 1987 was crucial to the sale of the building 13 days later for $ 22.6 million more than it cost the <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> partnership just two years earlier, according to the new owner and public records. The <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> partnership had bought the building in March 1985 for nearly twice its assessed value at a time when the government wanted to move more than a third of its offices elsewhere. Three months after the <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> partnership purchased the building, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration disclosed publicly that it had decided to remain in there. An attorney for the Meeses denies any wrongdoing on their part in the transactions, but acknowledges that the Benders and <PERSON> Meeses </PERSON> know each other. The Benders refuse to discuss the matter. A key government official said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> played no role in the real estate decision. Other <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> buildings have done business with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Government documents show that <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> and his two brothers, <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, as a partnership, signed a lease in June 1985 to give the government more space in a downtown office building, One <LOCATION> McPherson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, where it has leased several floors since 1971. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> occupies part of one floor there.

 Shiite Moslem hijackers freed another hostage from a <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> jumbo jet Thursday after negotiators resumed their efforts to end the 10-day-old crisis. A man dressed in a white robe descended from the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 at 9:45 p.m. -LRB- 5:45 EDT -RRB-, got into a car and was driven across the tarmac to the VIP lounge at <LOCATION> Houari </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boumedienne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Algerian officials said the released hostage was a <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> named <PERSON> Djuma </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdelhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Chatti </PERSON>. The elderly, grizzled man was greeted by <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> officials and hustled inside the building. `` Praise to God, I am fine, but they had me tied all the time and I am tired,'' said <PERSON> Chatti </PERSON>, who gave his age as 70. `` They are not good people,'' he told reporters in the airport lounge. `` They beat me.'' After the release, the hijackers broadcast a message to the control tower in Arabic and English repeating their demand for the release of 17 pro-Iranian terrorists jailed in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. The statement said <PERSON> Chatti </PERSON> had been released for `` strictly humanitarian reasons.'' <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> has refused the demand of the gunmen, who seized the plane April 5 on a Bangkok-Kuwait flight and are holding at least 30 hostages. On Thursday evening, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s deputy foreign minister, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Osaimi </PERSON>, reiterated that the 17 would not be freed. <PERSON> Al-Osaimi </PERSON> is head of a high-level <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> delegation on the scene. Another Kuwaiti official, speaking to reporters on condition he not be identified, said the Algerian authorities continued to put pressure on <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> to be more flexible in its position. `` You can see this from the fact that they are telling us that the ball is in our court,'' the official said. Negotiations between the hijackers and Algerian mediators resumed Thursday evening after a breakdown earlier in the day caused by the lack of progress, according to the official Algerian news agency. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, lawmakers urged Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to intervene because of reports that one of the hijackers might be responsible for kidnapping <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s independent al-Qabas newspaper reported Wednesday that the alleged kidnapper, <PERSON> Imad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mughniyeh </PERSON>, was believed to have boarded the plane when it landed in <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mughniyeh </PERSON> has been identified as one of the security chiefs in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, which is believed to be the umbrella organization for pro-Iranian groups holding foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. From <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION>, the plane flew to <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> officials negotiated with the hijackers. The gunmen have killed two passengers and freed 70. Among the remaining hostages are three members of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s royal family. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> accused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of being behind the hijacking and said some of the gunmen `` belong to the Iranian government.'' Egyptian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON> echoed <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s comments Thursday in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. In a radio call to the airport tower Thursday, a passenger who identified himself as <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zayed </PERSON> said: `` I ask my government to release the 17 Islamic Jihad prisoners. If not, they will kill us all.'' Islamic Jihad, or Holy War, is the group that holds <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, and it also is demanding the release of the 17 Kuwaiti prisoners. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, was kidnapped March 16, 1985. He has been held longer than any of the 22 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The hijackers, said to be armed with grenades and guns, have threatened to blow up the plane and kill their remaining hostages if their demands are not met. A ranking Algerian official said Wednesday that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s `` intransigence'' had created the standstill <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s negotiating committee is divided into two teams led by Interior Minister <PERSON> Hedi </PERSON> <PERSON> Khediri </PERSON>. One team is responsible for contacts with the Kuwaitis, and the other with the hijackers. A doctor was allowed on board the plane Thursday to examine the hostages. `` I saw no sign of any illness that required hospitalization or major medicine,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Youssef </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>. He later told the official Algerian news agency that he prescribed some `` routine medicines'' that would be sent to the plane. `` The passengers I saw did not have their hands tied and displayed no signs of physical violence,'' <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> said. An airport crew also went aboard to clean up and serve hot food, the Algerian official said. In a letter Wednesday to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Slaughter </PERSON>, both <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Democrats, wrote: `` We know the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is not a primary party to the <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> negotiations. But if <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s chief kidnapper is on the Kuwaiti jet, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government must insure that the negotiators are aware of this fact.'' `` It would be a travesty for <PERSON> Imad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mughniyeh </PERSON> to go free while <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> remains a captive,'' they said. In <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, government spokesman <PERSON> Akis </PERSON> <PERSON> Fantis </PERSON> said that the jetliner was refueled and allowed to leave for <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> only after <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> gave assurances that the remaining passengers would be freed on arrival there. The plane landed in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> on Tuesday night. It was moved early Thursday to the end of the runway so another jet could land. It was later returned to its original position about 400 yards from the terminal.

 The federal parole commission Thursday said anti-Castro militant <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> would be either released into the custody of immigration officials on May 16 or paroled into the community on June 16. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says it still plans to institute proceedings to deport <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>, a Cuban native, came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the 1960s and lived in the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area. He never became a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen. <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> entered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> illegally in February after his release from a Venezuelan prison, and he has been detained at the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, for violating the terms of his parole. Four members of the parole commission said <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> will be released into the custody of the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> on May 16 if the immigration service exercises its option to detain him. If the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> does n't exercise that option, he would be paroled into the community on June 16 and would be on probation through 1992 Regardless of when or under what conditions he is released, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> plans to seek to have <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> deported, said <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, an immigration service spokesman. During any exclusionary proceedings, <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> could be detained by immigration officials, released on bond, released on his own recognizance or released into the custody of family or someone else in the community, <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> had made no decision on where <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> would be deported if such action were approved. Deputy <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> commissioner <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Everson </PERSON> had said earlier this year that the agency would go forward with proceedings to deport <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> opposes terrorism no matter who the target is. <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>, 61, was convicted of conspiring to bomb foreign freighters and of firing a recoilless rifle in 1968 at a Polish freighter docked in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. He served four years of a 10-year federal prison sentence in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and has acknowledged violating his parole when he traveled to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in 1974. He served 11 years in Venezuelan jails until his acquittal on charges of bombing a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> jetliner in which 73 died in 1976.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> said Thursday saboteurs caused the ammunition dump explosion that killed at least 96 people, and denied the weapons were destined for guerrillas in neighboring <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` My personal assessment is that it could n't be anything but a very effective way of sabotage,'' <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> told reporters during an informal briefing at the presidential palace. In previous comments, <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> had not ruled out an accidental explosion. He said `` somebody who is not in line with us,'' was responsible for a series of blasts at the dump between <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rawalpindi </LOCATION> last Sunday that caused rockets and grenades to rain on both cities for more than half an hour. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> would not elaborate, explaining: `` I do n't want to hurt the inquiries'' being conducted into the explosion. Although the official death toll stands at 96, scores of people still are listed as missing. More than 1,000 were reported injured. In rejecting reports that the weapons were meant for Afghan guerrillas, he said the dump was used only by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s army. After the explosion, witnesses said they saw burning trucks with Afghan license plates near the site. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has been a conduit for foreign military aid to <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> guerrillas, who have headquarters in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is one of the countries that has supplied the rebels.

<TEXT>
 Democratic hopeful <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> denounced President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> and others for making race and religion issues in the presidential campaign, saying they are `` making hysteria while I'm making history.'' The preacher-turned-politician read a lengthy speech Thursday to the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION> in which he expounded his `` Jackson Doctrine'' of foreign affairs. `` The next president must know the world and have a realistic understanding of our possibilities,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` Our policy must be changed. ... We must change our course or lose our way.'' He called for `` a new realism'' in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policies and a halt to the race to modernize the superpowers' nuclear arsenals. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> then moved back to the rhetoric he uses so well in answering questions from the editors and later from reporters. Asked about those who say the nation is `` not ready for a black president,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said such conclusions are the result of `` journalistic incest'' among those who have not gotten out among Americans to learn how much the nation has grown. `` We went across the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> on Super Tuesday without a single catcall or boo, without a single ugly sign at a mass meeting,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. Then he launched his criticism of those who have raised race in advance of Tuesday's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary. `` It was not until we got north to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that the litmus tests of race and religion became spouted from the mouths of public officials without a significant media challenge,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` ... Then joined in yesterday by the president and then joined in today by Ms. -LRB- <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>.'' `` I simply say some people are making hysteria while I'm making history,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> added later at a news conference. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, who endorsed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> rival Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> on Thursday, said recently that Jews would `` have to be crazy'' to vote for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> because of his positions on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the editors on Wednesday that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been spared criticism because of the fear that comments would be interpreted as `` some kind of racial attack.'' `` That's a statement of trauma,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told reporters after the editors' speech. `` President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> no doubt feels the pressure of our campaign.'' In a speech on Wednesday night, Ms. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> lauded <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> but added that if he `` were not black, he would n't be in the race.'' The former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate for vice president said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> could win neither the nomination nor the general election. In his foreign policy speech, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said that as president he would impose a nuclear warhead testing and missile testing moratorium to start the process toward major reduction in both nuclear and convention forces. He denounced the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> as an expansion of the arms race, saying, `` If Star Wars takes it to the heavens, it may soon become literally lunatic.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said his `` Jackson Doctrine'' has four basic principles: _ Support for international institutions and respect for international law _ Recognition for the right of self-determination for the `` struggling peoples of the Third World. _ Support for human rights `` Gross and repeated violators of human rights should not be recipients of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid or of trade preferences,'' he said. _ The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> must be a force for economic growth and justice `` We will not succeed as an island of affluence in a sea of misery and we will pay a heavy price for trying,'' he said.

<HEAD>Indictment Hits Tax-Shelter Schemes Day Before Tax Deadline</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nearly 6,000 taxpayers cut their payments by $ 88 million by claiming huge writeoffs for energy-saving devices that may not have even worked, authorities said Thursday as they announced the indictment of 12 people. The 86-count indictment handed up Thursday represents one of the largest tax shelter frauds ever prosecuted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> S.G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. The indictment charges that taxpayers in 47 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> paid at least $ 44 million to two corporations for a stake in energy-saving devices that purportedly would give the investors tax credits. The scheme cost the government $ 88 million for the 1982 and 1983 tax years, according to the indictment, but authorities said they expected to recover much of the money from the taxpayers. `` This prosecution involves a very sophisticated attempt to lure taxpayers into making investments that would, according to their promoters, result in many times the investment in tax savings,'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said. All 12 defendants stand charged with conspiracy to defraud the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, aiding the filing of false tax returns and mail fraud. Three defendants _ <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuffrida </PERSON>, 51, of <LOCATION> Belle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Terre </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuffrida </PERSON>, 47, of <LOCATION> Dix </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jeffeson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> _ are also charged with racketeering through mail fraud and interstate transportation of money and securities taken by fraud. The taxpayers did not necessarily know they were involved in an illegal scheme, because the marketing was thoroughly professional with videotapes, glossy brochures and seminar presentations, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabbrielli </PERSON>, who will prosecute the case. According to the indictment, two leasing companies, both based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> state </LOCATION>, offered taxpayers the chance to lease an energy device for an initial $ 5,000 to $ 25,000, depending on the model. The companies told the taxpayers they could claim investment and energy tax credits for the purported fair market value of the device, ranging from $ 65,000 to $ 280,000. The heart of the fraud case stems from the purported fair market value, which authorities said was actually $ 304 to $ 1,855. `` The figures were completedly inflated,'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said. `` Of course, there were questions about whether there were really these energy savings.'' The devices, which prosecutors did not describe in detail, were to be installed at a commercial site, which would then share any energy savings with the taxpayer. The taxpayer in turn would pay a portion of the electricity savings back to the leasing companies and an array of bogus manufacturers. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> district director of the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the indictment was the culmination of a three-year investigation. `` We think it is time and money well spent,'' he said. The two leasing companies marketing the devices were <ORGANIZATION> OEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leasing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leasing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Melville </LOCATION>, N.Y. If convicted, the <ORGANIZATION> Giuffridas </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> face up to 345 years each in prison and fines ranging from $ 6.6 million to $ 10 million, plus forfeiture of assets. The other nine, if convicted, face prison sentences of up to 275 years and fines of up to $ 6.5 million. Also charged in the indictment were <PERSON> Zayle </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, 48, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 46, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleary </PERSON>, 43, <LOCATION> Levittown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeRaffele </PERSON>, 46, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rochelle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobin </PERSON>, 48, <LOCATION> Cherry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, 55, <LOCATION> Crystal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Enden </PERSON>, 47, <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marci </PERSON>, 46, <ORGANIZATION> Coram </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Oster </PERSON>, 30, Miller Place, N.Y.

 An engine on a <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> jetliner exploded into jagged pieces Thursday, slicing through both sides of the plane and forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing as some passengers screamed and fainted. Two flight attendants suffered bumps and bruises when the plane carrying 56 passengers plunged after the explosion, <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> said. Turbine blades ripped through the right rear bathroom and a work area for attendants as the plane cruised at 31,000 feet. `` If somebody had been in the bathroom or the stewardesses' quarters, they would have been killed,'' said passenger <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> `` My first thought was, ` This is it.''' `` It blew a big hole in the plane,'' said passenger <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, `` I'm 240 pounds, and it was big enough that I could crawl through it.'' `` All the kids were screaming,'' <PERSON> Hinton </PERSON> said. Piedmont Flight 486 was flying from <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, when its right jet turbine disintegrated about 9:45 a.m., <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> officials said. The plane, a <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> F-28, has two engines, one mounted on each side of the cabin. The plane, 40 miles south of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, immediately lost air pressure in the cabin; several passengers later complained of headaches, earaches and elevated blood pressure. `` It began with a wearing noise and loud vibrations about five or 10 times straight, and then there was an explosion in the back of us,'' said passenger <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. Turbine blades and engine parts ripped through the fuselage, punching holes in both sides of the plane. A hole on the right side, adjacent to the engine that disintegrated, was 2 feet wide by 6 feet tall. On the opposite side, the hole was 2 feet by 1 foot. The pilot noticed a fire indicator signal for his No. 2 engine, manufactured by <PERSON> Rolls </PERSON> <PERSON> Royce </PERSON>, and decided to land at <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, where he `` landed without incident'' at <LOCATION> Yeager </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, about 10 a.m., <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> said. Assistant airport manager <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Huffman </PERSON> said the F-28 was 40 miles south of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> and traveling north when the explosion occurred. The plane made a deep descent after the explosion `` but they got it under control. They all did a good job,'' <PERSON> Hinton </PERSON> said. A <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigator was dispatched to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> to investigate, airport officials said. <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> owns 25 of the German-built F-28 4000s, said another <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kress </PERSON>. Piedmont uses the jets, slightly smaller than <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s or McDonnell-Douglass DC9s, because many airports in its mountainous region have short runways. <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>'s airport, named for test pilot Gen. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeager </PERSON>, is located atop a mountain 2 miles north of the downtown area. Immediately after the explosion, oxygen masks dropped from the ceiling and flight attendants and adult passengers went through the aisles and assisted children, passengers said. But some masks did n't work and passengers had to be moved to other seats. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, who was sitting three rows from the rear of the plane, said a woman in the seat behind him who was traveling with two children passed out. `` She fainted. I turned around and she was blue. The baby was blue. And her 3-year-old was blue,'' <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> said. `` I grabbed her and put a mask on her, gave the baby to a woman who was sitting next to her and I took the 3-year-old up with me.'' About 90 minutes after the emergency landing, most passengers were placed on Flight 249, a Charleston-to-Chicago nonstop flight that was diverted to <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>. However, a few passengers flocked to rental car companies; they planned to continue their trip by car. Before Flight 249 took off for <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, paramedics checked the blood pressure of several passengers. `` It's a little high,'' <PERSON> Hinton </PERSON> said of his own blood pressure. `` But if I do n't get on that plane today, I'll have trouble flying again.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> has on file only two injury-related accidents involving <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> F-28s, said spokesman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>. One jet was involved in a minor taxiway collision in 1985, and in 1986, an unassisted handicapped passenger fell off the boarding stairs when a guardrail gave way, he said During the past 4 -LCB- years, only seven <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> flights resulted in injuries to passengers, the records show. The worst was on Oct. 25, 1986, when a jet overshot a <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> runway, causing three serious injuries and 31 minor ones. On Aug. 10, 1968, a <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> plane crashed on approach to the <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> airport, killing 35 people.

 Early results from blind AIDS tests among hospital patients show three in 1,000 infected with the virus that causes the deadly disease, according to a report released Thursday by federal health officials. The national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, in one attempt to gauge the prevalence of infection with the virus that causes AIDS, has launched a program to test anonymously blood samples taken from hospital patients at 40 hospitals in 30 cities. So far, just four hospitals have been enrolled in the program, all in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. All patients are being tested except those who already have AIDS or related conditions. In results from the four Midwestern hospitals, 0.3 percent of the 12,000 patients tested showed signs of infection by the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said in a report Thursday. Federal health officials continue to estimate that between 1 million and 1.5 million Americans _ from 0.4 percent to 0.6 percent _ are infected with AIDS virus. `` No new data have become available to prompt a change of this estimate,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. The Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> stressed that it is in the earliest stages of the hospital study. `` Accurate estimates of the prevalence ... of -LRB- AIDS virus -RRB- infection in the entire <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population are not possible at this time,'' the agency said. `` These data are from just one region; they are not -LRB- necessarily -RRB- representative of the nation,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dondero </PERSON>, a CDC AIDS specialist. `` You ca n't do a national estimate based on four spots.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> expects to enroll all 40 hospitals in its testing program by September. At the four hospitals reporting first, antibodies indicating infection by AIDS virus were more common among adults age 25 to 44. Rates also were higher for black and Hispanic persons than for whites, and higher for men than for women, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> report also reviewed tests among prisoners and among childbearing women. Out of 29,193 federal inmates tested by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> since last June, 843, or 2.9 percent, have tested positive for AIDS virus infection. That is little changed from a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announcement last fall, when 3 percent of the first inmates tested were positive. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said it hopes to contract with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> and with a major university for AIDS testing of 10,000 inmates at 10 state prisons beginning this June. In 52,326 tests of childbearing women in the state of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, researchers found an AIDS virus infection rate of 0.8 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, one woman in 61 showed antibodies against the AIDS virus, and 40 percent of those women passed the infections on to their newborn children, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> added. As of this week, 59,287 cases of AIDS itself have been reported in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>.

 Soviet media on Thursday called the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> accord in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> `` the news we've been waiting so long for,'' but there was only sketchy mention of the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s commitment to bring its soldiers home. Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> used only one sentence to sum up the consequences of the pact for the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops deployed in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` It was agreed that the withdrawal of Soviet troops is to start on May 15, and to be completed within nine months,'' it said. Other media reports, including state-run television's top evening news broadcast, made no reference to the pullout at all. Instead, most reports emphasized that the goal of the pact is the peaceful settlement of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s 10-year-old civil war, and reiterated Soviet backing for the embattled Marxist government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. Most Soviets, however, would be aware of the implications of the accords. Communist Party chief <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who has called the Afghan involvement his nation's `` bleeding wound,'' said last week that the pullout would begin in mid-May if the U.N.-brokered <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> negotiations were successful. Soviet leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> sent troops into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on Dec. 27, 1979, to preside over the replacement of one Marxist leader by another. They stayed on to help combat a nationwide insurgency in a military operation that has cost thousands of Soviet lives and billions of rubles, sparked domestic dissent, and poisoned the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s relations with other Moslem and Third World nations. Human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, who was sent into internal exile for almost seven years after criticizing the intervention, called the agreement signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> `` an enormous event.'' `` It was a horrible war, a horrible mistake by the Soviet leadership that had awful consequences for the Afghan people,'' said <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, the 1975 Nobel Peace laureate, who was reached by telephone at his <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> apartment. `` I am waiting with great impatience for May 15 to see the troop withdrawal begin,'' he added. From the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> withdrawal of the SALT II arms control treaty and the boycott of the 1980 <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Olympics by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 61 other nations to the canceling of grain and other trade agreements involving foreign suppliers, the Soviets paid the price for sending tanks and troops across the Afghan border. A <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> newspaper editor recently told a Western reporter of receiving a letter from a man whose only son was killed in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` Now the others are coming home,'' the writer of the letter said. `` But what did my boy die for?'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has estimated Soviet casualties since 1979 at 33,000-38 ,000, more than one-third of whom were killed Those figures do not include `` heavy losses'' to disease, the department said in a report issued in December. The agreement signed by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> commits the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> to ending its military intervention. State-run media's initial reporting on the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreements seemed designed to assure Soviets that their government's stated goal of achieving peace in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s civil war had been met, at least in part. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, in a statement to reporters after the ceremony, spoke not of the withdrawal of Soviet troops but of the end to all outside interference in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> mandated by the agreements. `` The entire spectrum of possible activities and actions to meddle in the affairs of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> has finally been blocked,'' he said, in remarks reported by the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency and shown on Soviet TV. `` Outside interference'' has been the term used by Soviets to describe the aid by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s anti-Marxist <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> insurgents. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said he wanted to do `` justice'' to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> role in bringing about an Afghan settlement, but depicted the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as the major peacemaker. The Afghan pact, he said, `` has been predetermined by my country's policy of solving acute international problems exceptionally by political means, which has been proclaimed by <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>.'' `` Vremya,'' the evening news program, made no mention at all Thursday night of the troop withdrawal. The newcast, with an estimated audience of 150 million, began with reports on the regular Thursday meeting of the ruling Politburo, the construction of an atomic icebreaker, and private farming plots in a region of the Russian federation. About 20 minutes into the broadcast, `` Vremya'' showed an eight-minute report on what a correspondent in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> called a `` historic event of exceptional international importance.'' Another newscaster on state-run TV also waxed eloquent in reporting the agreements, which were also signed by top diplomats from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. `` Today in the World,'' an evening program, led off with a highly unusual editorial comment from anchorman <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Kudrin </PERSON>, who told viewers, `` We begin today with news that we've been waiting so long for.'' On Feb. 8, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the future political system of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> was `` none of our business,'' and stressed that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had dropped a previous condition that a coalition government be formed before the beginning of a military withdrawal. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> on Thursday reiterated <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> backing for <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, saying what is crucial in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is `` every kind of support for the success of the national reconcilation policy'' proclaimed last year by the Afghan leader.

 Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> picked up the presidential primary endorsement Thursday, for better or for worse, of Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> who told a news conference: `` I'm available. Have shoes and mouth and will travel.'' `` I believe in what <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> stands for,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said, singling out the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator's positions on urban affairs, defense and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. At a City Hall news conference, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> often appeared stiff as he was relegated to a bit part, standing next to the irrepressible mayor who bantered with reporters and mugged for cameras. The other dominant figure in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Democratic politics, Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, has refused to endorse anyone, saying he would withold his backing until after the last primaries on June 7. New Yorkers vote Tuesday and <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> was asked what impact his endorsement might have. With an exaggerated shrug of his shoulders and a glance around a room that was filled to capacity, he said: `` Oh, probably nothing. That's why you're here.'' The first question after <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> read a statement endorsing <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was whether he feared that a vote for <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> would help <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> by siphoning away votes from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` That's exactly what I'm against,'' replied <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> `` voting for someone to stop someone else.'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> stirred a controversy last week when he said that Jews and other supporters of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would `` have to be crazy'' to vote for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Later on Thursday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had temperate responses to <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s endorsement. `` We had a very good discussion last night,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` He said that if I won the nomination, he would campaign for me and with me, and I appreciate that.'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> had said the choice was between <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who added, `` He likes us both.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said endorsements are positive. `` What he has done by choosing someone is positive and fair and proper,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told reporters after a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> did condemn what he called <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s `` race-based statements.'' `` It was not until we got north to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that the litmus tests of race and religion became spouted from the mouths of public officials without a significant media challenge,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, singling out <LOCATION> Koch </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>. At the endorsement news conference he said he was prepared to support the candidate nominated by the Democrats at their convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in July. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said his reason for supporting <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` would not be because I believe in his positions, but I believe he'd be less destructive than the presidency of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' Then he added, `` If he -LRB- <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> -RRB- wants me to go out and make that statement, I'd be happy to go anywhere.'' As for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ regarded as the front-runner in the race for the 255 delegates at stake in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s on <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary _ <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said he called the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor to inform him he had decided to support <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. `` He was very charming about it,'' said the mayor. `` Very nice about it. He made it easier.'' Did he call <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>? `` No, he was never in the running,'' said the mayor. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> met for nearly an hour Wednesday night at <LOCATION> Gracie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mansion </LOCATION>, the mayor's residence. Neither man commented after the meeting. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> had a similar session with <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> Tuesday night. Asked about <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s chances of overcoming the big lead polls give <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the race, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> recalled that when he ran for the Democratic nomination for governor in 1982 against <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> `` I started out 40-plus points ahead of any other candidate and I upset the odds.'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> won that primary and went on to be elected governor. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> brushed off suggestions that his support might hurt <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> among some <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> voters, particularly Hispanics. The mayor said that Hispanics are among his strongest supporters despite criticism from community leaders who objected to <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s refusal to accede to their demand that his appoint a Hispanic to the board of education.

<HEAD>Mecham Attorneys Reportedly Seek Deal on Criminal Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said Thursday he would n't agree to leave the state in exchange for the dismissal of criminal charges against him, as his lawyers reportedly proposed. The former governor, who was removed from office April 4 when convicted in his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> impeachment trial, insisted in a radio interview he did not know about the alleged proposal by two of his lawyers. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> KTAR </ORGANIZATION> radio, said: `` I would have made no deal with anybody that I would leave the state for two years. I've done nothing wrong. `` I'm in the middle of things in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, and I do n't plan to go away,'' the former governor said. State Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said Wednesday that the two lawyers met with state Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> in an attempt to get the criminal charges against <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> dropped. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said he understood the meeting occurred last week, but <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> would not say whether the meeting took place. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, De Long and <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> are Republicans. `` Maybe somebody had some conversations,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said, but he added that the lawyers reportedly involved were not those handling his criminal case. `` I ca n't say it did n't happen. I did n't know of it,'' he said. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> has repeatedly said he expects to be acquitted in his May 19 criminal trial on charges of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan. In a related development, his criminal-case attorney, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, filed a special action in the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> seeking dismissal of the charges on grounds that <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> manipulated the grand jury process in seeking the indictment. A lower court judge had previously refused to dismiss the charges. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s impeachment trial lawyers, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Craft </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerris </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, approached him a week ago and asked him to set up a meeting with <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> to discuss the possibility of having the criminal charges dropped. `` It was a dismissal in return for certain concessions on the part of the respondent, and while I did not hear all of the details, I did act as an intermediary for a meeting to be set up,'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said. Craft and <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> did not return calls placed to their <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> office. <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> said he would treat <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> `` just like I treat anybody else.'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said he previously had asked Chief Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Twist </PERSON> to dismiss some of the counts but that he had never approached the attorney general with a suggestion similar to the one made to De Long. `` Craft and <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> did come to me after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> trial and asked what I thought about them talking to someone,'' he said. `` I told them it was OK with me, but if they were going to the attorney general's office, I thought it would be a waste of time. For that reason, I did n't bother going with them.'' The concessions that <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Craft </PERSON> suggested to him would include <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> leaving the state for a two-year Mormon mission, calling off political backers who are targeting some legislators for defeat next fall and promising never to run for office again, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> Willard </PERSON>, face charges of fraud, perjury and filing false documents for failing to report a $ 350,000 campaign loan from a <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION> developer to <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s 1986 campaign. In other developments, state Treasurer <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Rottas </PERSON> said he might refuse to release state funds for <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s impeachment trial defense. <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> said he would issue an opinion on whether the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> had the authority to agree to pay $ 202,000 to <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s lawyers The state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, reversing a stand it took last year, voted Thursday for a state holiday to honor <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. The sponsor, Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, said that if the bill gets through the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> caucus to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor, she believes both houses would approve it. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> caused a storm of controversy shortly after taking office in January 1986 by rescinding a limited King holiday for executive-branch employees, arguing his predecessor had no legal right to create it. Although <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said he did so on the advice of <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>, the action generated an international controversy.

 Gov. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON> said Thursday that he and at least 53 other members of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>'s delegation will vote for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at the Democratic National Convention because of commitments <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has made to help this <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commonwealth But <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who won the non-binding beauty contest primary here, said his campaign would look into the situation and perhaps challenge the decision. `` We do not know all the details behind that. Suffice to say, it is radically inconsistent in a democracy for the people to go in one direction and the delegates to go in another direction,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> news conference. `` It's premature to respond. We will seek clarity,'' he added. `` There should be a reaonsable correlation between popular votes and delegates votes in a democracy.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as president would end discrimination and provide just treatment in welfare, Medicaid and other federal programs for Puerto Ricans on this <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island as well as on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mainland, <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON> said at a news conference. And if Puerto Ricans vote in a referendum on political status to reject statehood and keep the current commonwealth form of government, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would `` submit to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the necessary measures to strengthen commonwealth,'' <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> will send 56 voting delegates to the national convention. The majority decided at a meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Hernandez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colon </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> last Thursday to endorse <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Agosto </PERSON> said `` No one spoke in favor of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> or <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Cirolo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tirado </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PDP </ORGANIZATION>'s youth coordinator and a delegate-elect whose selection will be confirmed at a party caucus on April 24. `` It was unanimous in favor of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Carasquillo </PERSON>, a delegate who also attended. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Agosto </PERSON> endorsed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at a news conference Wednesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Initially, it was unclear how many delegates they represented because most either were elected March 20 on a non-committed slate, or have yet to be formally appointed. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Agosto </PERSON> said Thursday that most of the 33 delegates elected last month attended last week's meeting, as did the 18 delegates-elect who formally will be appointed later this month. The main issues in the March 20 primary were local. The <ORGANIZATION> PDP </ORGANIZATION> and the out-of-power <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which favors statehood, each submitted their own slates. The <ORGANIZATION> PDP </ORGANIZATION>, which favors commonwealth, won in every district. Members of the other party will have two delegates to the convention. A non-binding straw poll was held the same day. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> finished first with about 32 percent of the vote, but <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Agosto </PERSON> stressed even then that the delegates were not bound by the results of the poll. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON>, whose son works in the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign, and <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Agosto </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> Wednesday in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Both said they will campaign this weekend for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which has large Puerto Rican communities. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary is set for next Tuesday. <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, located 1,000 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, is a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territory whose residents are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens with most every right and obligation except they can not vote for president and they pay no federal taxes.

<HEAD>Court Spokesman Says Hamadi Could Get Life from Juvenile Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A court spokesman on Thursday confirmed reports from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that a juvenile court could sentence <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> to life in prison if he is convicted in the 1985 <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacking. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said Wednesday that West German authorities had informed <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials a juvenile court could sentence <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> as an adult and give him life, the maximum sentence, if he is found guilty of murder and air piracy. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kehren </PERSON>, spokesman for the Hesse state court, said the juvenile court could decide to deal with <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> as adult. `` The juvenile court in fact has more leeway in handling this case and sentencing him if he's found guilty,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview. `` If it determines <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was more juvenile than adolescent, the maximum sentence is 10 years. If found more adolescent than an adult, 10 to 15 years, and if the court decided he was an adult, up to life imprisonment.'' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> awaits trial on charges that he led the June 1985 hijacking to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> Flight 847 during which <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was killed and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days. On Tuesday, the Hesse state court said it had turned <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s case over to a juvenile court because there was doubt about his exact age at the time he allegedly began planning the hijacking West German law defines a juvenile as anyone under 18 years of age, an adolescent as 18 to 21 years old and an adult as 21 or over. Personality development and family environment also play a role in determining what category is applicable, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Frankfurt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allgemeine </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. Files in the Hesse prosecutor's office give <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s birth date as June 13, 1964, which would have made him 21 the day the hijacking began on June 14, 1985. Asked how long the juvenile court would study the case before setting a trial date, <PERSON> Kehren </PERSON> said: `` My guess would be in a month, maybe a little longer. But to say six months as some have been asking about is in my opinion way off the mark.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> asked <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to extradite <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> on murder and hijacking charges, but the West Germans turned down the request and said he would be tried here. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> is on trial in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on charges of kidnapping two West Germans in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to use as ransom for the release of his brother. One of the hostages has been freed. Both Hamadis were living in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> when they were arrested two weeks apart at the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport in January 1987 on charges of possessing explosives.

 Democratic leaders dropped compromise efforts Thursday and vowed to push forward with a sweeping trade bill containing a controversial plant-closing provision in defiance of White House veto threats. The decision reversed a drive one day earlier in which the leaders had sought to persuade union representatives to accept dropping the plant-closing provision to avoid a threatened veto by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. As a result of the decision, the fate of the sweeping, 1,000-page trade bill that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been fashioning for three years was placed in jeopardy. Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., said an expanding trade gap demonstrated that `` now is not the time to let the trade bill go down the tubes, but that is exactly what will happen if the plant-closing and the foreign investment-disclosure provisions remain in the package. Another target of administration veto warnings has been a provision that would require public disclosure of sizeable foreign investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Lawmakers have not decided yet whether to include that measure in the trade bill. Democrats said the reversal came amid intense pressure Thursday morning on House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, from within the Democratic Caucus not to abandon unions in their quest for the plant-closings provisions. They said the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> and other labor groups lobbied furiously Wednesday night and Thursday morning to build support among caucus members. `` Unfortunately, a single issue has emerged that threatens to defeat the entire bill,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill. `` I hope in the coming days that the president, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, business and labor groups will carefully consider the price the nation will pay if we fail to enact this essential legislation. White House spokesman <PERSON> B.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> issued a reminder that six Cabinet officers wrote to lawmakers `` two weeks ago telling the Hill that they would recommend a veto if plant closings was in the bill.'' But a statement from <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, indicated that they would press forward with the bill including the plant-closings `` We have consulted extensively with our colleagues,'' a statement from <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders said. `` Given today's trade figures and the resulting plunge in the stock market, we now believe strongly that we should move as quickly as possible with a strong trade and competitiveness bill, including protections for workers who are about to be laid off or whose plants are about to close.'' The statement said that they had `` gone more than halfway to meet administration concerns.'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, who had long campaigned for such a measure, said that he expected the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to take up the bill within the next several weeks and predicted overwhelming support for it. `` Concern for the trade numbers hardens support for the bill as it stands, and when the market fell, that tilted it to the final decision to go ahead,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said in a statement. Earlier Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit widened dramatically in February to $ 13.8 billion, its biggest shortfall since October and the second straight increase. Wall Street reacted with a 101.46 drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The plant-closing provision would require companies with at least 100 employees to provide 60-day notice of plant closings and layoffs involving at least one-third of their work force. Layoffs of 500 or more, even if less than one-third of the work force, would have to be preceded by notice. Democrats said that another key factor that prompted <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s decision to press forward with the provision was intense pressure within the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, many of whose members were lobbied heavily by labor unions Labor, which was counting on the provision, already was rankled after lawmakers jettisoned a provision of the bill sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., calling for 10 percent rollbacks in Japanese and several other nations' trade surpluses with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Thursday's decision came as a surprise after the leaders met behind closed doors Wednesday with union leaders and urged them to accept dropping the plant-closings provision, which critics have said would be too burdensome for business. <PERSON> Top </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials met briefly with congressional leaders Thursday to discuss trade legislation and then slipped away without commenting on results of the meeting. `` We're still exploring it,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told reporters after the 30-minute, closed-door session with <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was asked about reports that lawmakers were unwilling to drop the sweeping, 1,000-page trade bill's controversial plant-closings provision without a guarantee that it would assure that the president would sign the rest of the measure `` I think they understand that,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. The plant-closings plan is among scores of provisions of the trade bill. The central provisions would transfer authority to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative to retaliate against violations of international agreements and other `` unjustifiable acts.'' The president now has that power. Other central provisions would streamline the machinery under which the government imposes import curbs to aid American businesses threatened by surges in imported goods. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> told reporters that the plant-closings provision should stay in the trade bill and that a number of Democrats would abandon their support of the legislation if the labor-backed provision were dropped. He said it was by no means clear that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would veto the bill if the measure contained plant-closings when it reached his desk.

<HEAD>Soviet Health Officials Explain 1979 Anthrax Outbreak</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM PAUL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Top Soviet health officials said Thursday that an anthrax outbreak that killed 64 people in <LOCATION> Sverdlovsk </LOCATION> eight years ago was caused by contaminated meat, not an accident at a germ-warfare laboratory. The officials, including Dr. <PERSON> Petr </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgasov </PERSON>, the Soviet's deputy minister of health at the time, made the comments during a conference on the disease at the <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> `` There is no reason for any suspicion,'' said <PERSON> Burgasov </PERSON>, who along with two companions had treated victims in <LOCATION> Sverdlovsk </LOCATION>. `` If there had been an explosion, not 96 people would have been affected, but literally hundreds of thousands of people.'' The officials offered a detailed explanation of the April 1979 accident, discounting sketchy reports at the time by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials that it was caused by exposure to a lethal biological agent. The Soviet explanation, presented first in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> earlier this week, has been hailed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> academicians as the most detailed, public account of the outbreak. The three Soviet doctors said they are spending a week in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> attempting to convince Western physicians, scholars and politicians of their explanation. <PERSON> Burgasov </PERSON> acknowledged that the Soviets' failure to disclose the incident led to suspicion in the West. `` The fact that there was no data given at the time always leads to suspicion,'' he said. The disease, which is caused by a bacteria, killed 64 of the 96 people it afflicted, <PERSON> Burgasov </PERSON> said, speaking through an interpreter at a lecture attended by about 100 people. Anthrax, which also kills cattle, is transmitted most commonly by contact with infected animals, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Textbook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>. Burgasov and Dr. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Sergiyev </PERSON> said the disease was traced back to a bone-meal animal feed that had been improperly processed at a Soviet manufacturing plant. The meal was fed to animals who subsequently died. The meat was sold privately and illegally to people in <LOCATION> Sverdlovsk </LOCATION>, the doctors said. `` In 1979 there was very little meat -LRB- in the region -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Burgasov </PERSON> said. `` Meat was a luxury, it was used only on special occasions.'' He said children did not become sick because they were fed daily at child care centers with food that came from a central distribution center. Vegetarians and people who did not eat the underground meat did not get sick, <PERSON> Burgasov </PERSON> said. `` This is why we became suspicious of the meat.'' `` All of the tragedy of this illness passed right before my eyes,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Nikiforov </PERSON>, an expert in infectious diseases who treated many of the victims. Using graphic slides, <PERSON> Nikiforov </PERSON> showed symptoms of the two types of anthrax _ contaneous and gastrointestinal _ that afflicted victims in <LOCATION> Sverdlovsk </LOCATION>. Those who had contaneous anthrax, characterized by lesions on the skin, eventually recovered. Victims of gastrointestinal anthrax, in which the disease infects the stomach and intestines, died within a two days of toxic shock, <PERSON> Nikiforov </PERSON> said. Dr. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Langmuir </PERSON>, a former chief epidemiologist at the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said he finds the Soviet account credible. <PERSON> Langmuir </PERSON>, who moderated the discussion at <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, said he expects to learn more during the remainder of the Soviets' stay. Anthrax expert Dr. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Brachman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Univeristy </ORGANIZATION> called the Soviets' presentation in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> a `` landmark report'' in an interview Tuesday with the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Brachman </PERSON> said the Soviet doctors provided `` a pretty good indication that this incident was an outbreak of gastrointestinal anthrax'' caused by contaminated meat.

 Defense lawyers looked to Gov. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> for a last-minute reprieve Thursday night for <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, scheduled to die in the electric chair for strangling a neighbor during a 1980 robbery. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in a 7-2 vote Thursday night, denied the 33-year-old <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON> a stay. Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> dissented. <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Deans </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> on Jails and Prisons, an organization that finds attorneys for death sentence appeals, said a request for clemency would be presented to the governor. Earlier, <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON> was taken to a room adjacent to the State Penitentiary's death chamber for a scheduled 11 p.m. execution. It would be the seventh death sentence carried out in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and the 98th in the nation since the 1976 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling allowing states to resume use of the death penalty. The appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> had centered on abuse <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON> contended he suffered as a child but did not disclose until after being sentenced to death in 1981. <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON> was one of six death row inmates who escaped from the <ORGANIZATION> Mecklenburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in 1984. He was recaptured a day later while eating cheese and drinking wine with another escapee at a coin laundry in <LOCATION> Warrenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. Earlier Thursday, a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> unanimously overturned a stay that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> had granted Tuesday. <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> said he wanted to conduct a hearing on arguments that <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON> was incompetent and unable to assist in his defense when a <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> jury convicted him of the murder of <PERSON> Wilhemina </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a school librarian who lived in his apartment building. The appeal cited a psychiatric report saying <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON> suppressed memories of his violent childhood, thus hampering defense efforts to present mitigating evidence that could have resulted in a life sentence. The appeals panel said <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON>'s case had been given least 10 reviews in state and federal courts and his sentencing had been found constitutional. In addition, the appeals court said, <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON>'s attorney had failed during a previous federal appeal to raise the issue of abuse after <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON> had disclosed it. At his 1981 trial, <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON> refused his lawyer's request to submit to a psychiatric examination, and the only mitigating evidence presented to the jury at his sentencing hearing was that he attended Bible classes while in jail awaiting trial. After the trial, <PERSON> Clanton </PERSON> said he was beaten as a child by his father and was sexually abused by his stepmother. After leaving his father, he moved to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> to live with his mother but got into trouble there and was convicted of a murder. He was later paroled.

<HEAD>Salaries Climb For 1987-88 Graduates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Petroleum engineers commanded the highest starting salary among recent college graduates, earning an average of $ 33,840, according to a survey issued Thursday. The salary level represented a gain of nearly 10 percent since July, while job offers climbed 36 percent, said the report by the private, non-profit, <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Placement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` The college recruiting picture for 1987-88 continues to look bright, if average salary offers are an indication,'' the survey said. Only inexperienced master's of business administration candidates with non-technical undergraduate degrees saw a drop in salary offers. Their salaries fell 4.4 percent since July to $ 30,480. Experienced MBA graduates with non-technical degrees received higher offers, as did inexperienced MBA graduates with technical backgrounds. The average salary offers for mechanical engineers climbed 3.8 percent to $ 29,388, while the average for electrical engineers went up 1.4 percent to $ 29,316. Chemical engineers earned $ 30,768, a 3.1 percent increase. Salary offers for accounting graduates jumped to an average of $ 23,700 a year, up more than 9 percent since July. Salaries for graduates in marketing and distribution rose 2.7 percent to $ 20,904. Banking-finance graduates averaged $ 21,792, while human resource graduates averaged $ 19,212, about the same as in January. In the allied health field, offers ranged from $ 19,440 to $ 30,000, with an average of $ 24,660, about the same as in January. Salaries for nurses fell slightly since January. In this latest report, they ranged from $ 18,996 to $ 28,368 and averaged $ 23,604. Salaries for computer science graduates rose slightly since July, for an average of $ 26,676, but job offers declined 2 percent from this time last year. Computer programmers were offered $ 20,064 to $ 30,492 and averaged $ 25,944, which represents a slight increase since July. Of all job offers made to graduates with bachelor's degrees, 53 percent went to non-technical graduates while 47 percent were extended to technical graduates. Public accounting employers made the most offers to non-technical graduates, offering 45 percent of their entry level jobs at an average salary of $ 24,024. The aerospace industry continued to provide the most job offers to technical graduates, offering 16.5 percent of entry level jobs at an average pay of $ 29,280. Comparing salaries around the nation, the survey found that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> employers offered the highest average salaries to accounting graduates, $ 27,408. Aerospace engineers commanded the highest salaries of $ 28,776 in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, while electrical engineers there commanded the highest average of $ 30,144. Chemical engineers received an average salary offer of $ 31,428 from employers in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Placement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> represents career planning nd placement directors of 1,300 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> colleges and universities, as well as the nation's leading corporate and government recruiting organizations. The organization has conducted such surveys for more than 20 years. The current survey, which covered the period from Sept. 1 to March 7, includes several new categories covering different periods of time, making some comparisons with last year's data impossible, the organization said.

<TEXT>
 A car bomb blew up in front of a club for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> on Thursday, killing five people and wounding at least 17, Italian officials said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast that happened shortly after 8 p.m. -LRB- 2 p.m. EDT -RRB- at the USO club. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> initially reported one sailor was killed and four injured, but <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Haney </PERSON> later said authorities in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> could not confirm any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military deaths. He said three sailors were hurt. Italian media quoted officials as saying three men and two women died in the blast. Witnesses said one of the bodies at the entrance of the club was draped in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag. Italian hospital officials said at least four Americans were among the injured. Italian media said the bomb exploded during a reception at the club for the commander of the USS Paul, a torpedo boat destroyer docked in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate official could not confirm the report. Passers-by screamed and ran when the explosion occurred outside the club, which is in one of <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>' busiest areas. `` It was a huge boom and we were all knocked to the ground. When we got up, all we could see was flames everywhere,'' an unidentified Italian woman told the state-run <ORGANIZATION> RAI </ORGANIZATION> television network from her hospital bed. `` We can confirm there are no fatalities from the three ships in port,'' said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Baumann </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, adding that there was a possibility that `` there could be a sailor dead from the local command,'' although he knew of no such death. The ships were the USS Paul, based in <LOCATION> Mayport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; the USS Capodanno, with a home port in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>; and the <ORGANIZATION> USNS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kaiser </ORGANIZATION>, a fueling vessel with no specific base, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. Two crew members from the USS Capodanno and one from the USS Paul were being treated for injuries in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Haney </PERSON> said in a statement. One crew member from the Capodanno was treated and released, it said. The Pentagon did not immediately release the names of the injured. The initial report of a dead sailor was the result of confusion following the blast, <PERSON> Haney </PERSON> said. A spokesman for <PERSON> Pellegrini </PERSON> <PERSON> Hospital </PERSON> said 14 of the wounded, including four Americans and eight Italians, were taken to a hospital. The spokesman, who spoke on condition he was not identified, said the Americans later were sent to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military hospital. He said he had no details on the extent of the injuries. RAI said one of the wounded, a 27-year-old Italian woman, was reported in grave condition. It said 60 to 70 people were inside the club at the time of the explosion. `` The entire scene is apocalyptic,'' said <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Pietro </PERSON> <PERSON> Lezzi </PERSON>, as he surveyed the damage. Antonio Barrel, the inspector general of public security in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, told the Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> that authorities do not yet know if the car bomb was set by foreigners or Italians. But the agency also quoted an unidentified police official as saying `` the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> connection seems most likely.'' Investigators said Thursday's blast destroyed the inside of the club and wrecked other parked cars. The bomb apparently was hidden in a Fiat 127 auto that was ripped apart by the explosion. The USO club is just off <PERSON> Piazza </PERSON> <PERSON> Municipio </PERSON>, about 200 yards from the <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> waterfront. Italian media noted the blast occurred almost exactly two years after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warplanes attacked <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Benghazi </LOCATION> in retaliation for alleged <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> involvement in the bombing of a nightclub in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> that killed an American soldier. A USO club in <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, was attacked Dec. 6 by an attacker with hand grenades who shouted `` Long live <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' The blasts killed <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Petty Officer <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Strong </PERSON> and injured nine other people. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has a major presence in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, the headquarters for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s southern command and the support center for the 6th Fleet.

<HEAD>Sandinistas, Contras Iron Out Differences On Renewing Talks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Leaders of the U.S.-supported Contra rebels and the leftist Sandinista government said Thursday they had reached a compromise that would allow cease-fire talks to go ahead. The agreement to start high-level negotiations in the Nicaraguan capital Friday came during the first official visit of Contra representatives to the capital since the war started more than six years ago. The two sides also resumed stalled talks on technical details of a temporary cease-fire, such as how to provide the rebels with humanitarian aid and security. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuadra </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacaso </PERSON>, chief of staff of the Sandinista army and head of the government's delegation to the technical talks, said before the meeting he was confident the two sides would `` finish discussing the plan'' for implementing the temporary cease-fire. Contra political representatives at the meeting included <PERSON> Aristides </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Montiel </PERSON> <PERSON> Arguello </PERSON>. The rebels' military delegation included <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> <PERSON> Centeno </PERSON> and <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON>. In a compromise, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> backed off demands that the technical talks be held in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. In exchange, the Contras retreated from their earlier insistence that Friday's high-level negotiations be conditioned on the successful outcome of the Sapoa talks. `` The Contras agreed that if the talks are not finished today -LRB- Thursday -RRB-, they'll conclude in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>,'' government Information Minister <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. Two Contra delegates, <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stadthagen </PERSON>, arrived from <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> in a private plane in the morning to negotiate the compromise. They were met at <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>'s Sandino airport by Tourism Minister <PERSON> Herty </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewites </PERSON>. It was the first time since the war began that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> allowed <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> representatives to set foot in the capital. In a brief talk with reporters later, <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON> confirmed <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON>'s announcement that a compromise was reached. In the technical talks, military representatives from both sides are seeking agreement on how to implement a provisional cease-fire accord they signed at <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> on March 23. The 60-day cease-fire began April 1 even though many issues were still to be resolved. So far both sides have agreed to seven cease-fire zones where the rebels will gather. Two points in the Contra proposal were termed `` non negotiable'' by the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. The Contra proposal would allow the combatants to receive arms and amunition while in the zones and bar the government from accepting military aid, which comes from the Soviet bloc. According to the March 23 cease-fire accord, the Sandinistas would permit the rebels to receive humanitarian aid, allow them to participate in a national reconciliation dialogue and release 700 political prisoners. Contra leaders also insisted on freedom of movement to meet with opposition leaders inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, which the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> at first refused. The government later said the rebels would be permitted to meet with <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> leaders and visit <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON>, the country's only opposition newspaper. The cease-fire talks are within the framework of a regional peace initiative signed by the presidents of five Central American countries including <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.

The 35-year-old suspect, who was identified by officials in his native <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> through fingerprints as <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>, is listed by the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> as a suspected member of the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said they had not yet established ties between <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> and any group. `` We have a lot of unanswered questions that we have to answer,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGinley </PERSON>, agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> was arrested Tuesday at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turnpike </LOCATION> service area in <LOCATION> Ridgefield </LOCATION> after a state trooper found three bombs in his car, officials said. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> DeGisi </PERSON> released <PERSON> Kikimura </PERSON> to federal agents without setting bail Thursday. <PERSON> Kikimura </PERSON> was taken to a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> jail to be held for a hearing Friday before a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> magistrate in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>. In a complaint filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, authorities charged <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> with possessing a fraudulent visa and unregistered firearms. If convicted, he faces up to $ 260,000 in fines and up to 15 years in prison. State and federal officials heading a terrorist task force said Thursday they have little information about <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> and what he planned to do with the bombs. <PERSON> McGinley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kikimura </PERSON> had not spoken to federal officials since being taken into custody. According to Japanese authorities, <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> was acquitted in a Japanese court in 1986 of charges of possessing dynamite in his luggage at an airport in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, which deported him. The Japanese news agency <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>'s arrest Tuesday had raised suspicions the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> might be planning attacks during the summit of leaders of advanced industrial nations June 19 in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which advocates `` simultaneous world revolution'' and is believed to have members allied with pro-Palestinian groups in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, has been linked to a bloody attack on <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Lod </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in 1972 that killed 26 people and the hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> plane in 1977. The group has been largely inactive in the 1980s, but <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> officials have expressed concern it might revive its terrorist activities at the Olympics in September. State police Superintendent Col. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Pagano </PERSON> said the terrorist task force decided to investigate because of the sophisticated nature of the bombs. `` These are the first devices of this type that we have come across,'' <PERSON> Pagano </PERSON> said. Neither federal or state officials would elaborate. According to the federal complaint, police said the bombs consisted of three 18-inch steel cylinders. There was a total of 15 pounds of black powder in the car, officials said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> said authorities have learned <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> acquired an international driver's license in the name of <PERSON> Masatoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kishizona </PERSON> on Jan. 20. <PERSON> Kishizono </PERSON> is a 36-year-old employee of a hospital in <LOCATION> Kyoto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, who had reported his passport missing, police said. On Feb. 29, <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>, using a fraudulent passport bearing <PERSON> Kishizona </PERSON>'s name, applied for a visa to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> entered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on March 8.

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The secretary-general considers the positions of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> too far apart for a cease-fire to work and has proposed a new peace plan under which he would control the timing of a truce and other factors. <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> expressed his views in a written report submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday after meeting with envoys of both nations. A copy of the confidential 15-page report was made available to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday by sources close to the proceedings. The secretary-general has held four rounds of meetings in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with the combatants, at the council's request, in an effort to get their clear support for a resolution adopted last July. It demands an immediate cease-fire in the 7 -LCB- - year-old war and withdrawal of troops <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> concluded the talks this week and said in his report: `` I considered the positions of the two governments ... to be insufficient for purposes of implementing Resolution 598,'' then asked them to reply to a new proposal. He said he was awaiting their responses. His latest plan, a modification of others, gives the secretary-general authority to control the timing and intervals for implementing the resolution. It says the secretary-general would set a date for implementing the plan, and on that day a cease-fire would commence and an impartial body would begin investigating which side started the war. After an interval of several days, to be determined by the secretary-general, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> would begin withdrawing their forces. After another interval, also set by <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, other elements of the resolution would be carried out and both sides would announce their intention to repatriate all prisoners of war. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> has not commented publicly on the talks, but diplomats say <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace efforts are stalled because of intransigence by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and, to a lesser degree, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has said it accepts the resolution if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> does so explicitly. The Iranians have said only that they endorse an outline given by the secretary-general for implementation, not the resolution itself. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> insists <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> be declared the aggressor before a cease-fire takes effect. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in September 1980 after several border skirmishes. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is urging the council to impose an arms embargo on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to force its compliance with the resolution. An embargo resolution is being drafted but the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> wants to allow more time for diplomacy. In his report, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said he emphasized to both sides that a cease-fire must be `` an irreversible step towards the overall solution,'' not a recess used to rearm. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has expressed concern that without a permanent cease-fire and immediate troop withdrawal, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would use a lull to rearm, repair its damaged oil refineries and prepare for renewed warfare.

 Shiite Moslem hijackers freed another hostage from a Kuwaiti jumbo jet Thursday but said they will not retract their demands `` even if the price we have to pay is very high.'' The release of the elderly, grizzled man came after the hijackers resumed talks with Algerian mediators on ending the 10-day-old crisis. The man, dressed in a white robe, descended from the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 at 9:45 p.m. -LRB- 3:45 EDT -RRB-, got into a car and was driven across the tarmac to the VIP lounge at <LOCATION> Houari </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boumedienne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Algerian officials said he was a <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> named <PERSON> Djuma </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Chatti </PERSON>. `` Praise to God, I am fine, but they had me tied all the time and I am tired,'' said <PERSON> Chatti </PERSON>, who gave his age as 70. `` They are not good people,'' he told reporters in the airport lounge. `` They beat me.'' At least 30 hostages remained on board the plane seized April 5 on a Bangkok-Kuwait flight. The hijackers first diverted the plane to northern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. It flew three days later to <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> officials negotiated with the hijackers. The gunmen have killed two passengers and freed 71. Among the remaining hostages are three members of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s royal family. After the latest release, the hijackers broadcast a message to the control tower in Arabic and English, repeating their demand for the release of 17 pro-Iranian terrorists jailed in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. The statement said <PERSON> Chatti </PERSON> had been released for `` strictly humanitarian reasons.'' `` We repeat forcefully our demands for the liberation of our 17 brothers in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, and we will not go back on them even if the price we have to pay is very high,'' the statement said. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s deputy foreign minister, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Osaimi </PERSON>, reiterated that the 17 would not be freed. He is head of a high-level <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> delegation on the scene. Another Kuwaiti official, speaking to reporters on condition he not be identified, said the Algerian authorities continued to put pressure on <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> to be more flexible in its position. `` You can see this from the fact that they are telling us that the ball is in our court,'' the official said. Negotiations between the hijackers and Algerian mediators resumed Thursday evening after a breakdown earlier in the day caused by the lack of progress, according to the official Algerian news agency. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, lawmakers urged Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to intervene because of reports that one of the hijackers might be responsible for kidnapping <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s independent al-Qabas newspaper reported Wednesday that the alleged kidnapper, <PERSON> Imad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mughniyeh </PERSON>, was believed to have boarded the plane when it landed in <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mughniyeh </PERSON> has been identified as one of the security chiefs in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, which is believed to be the umbrella organization for pro-Iranian groups holding foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> accused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of being behind the hijacking and said some of the gunmen `` belong to the Iranian government.'' Egyptian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON> echoed <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s comments Thursday in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. In a radio call to the airport tower Thursday, a passenger who identified himself as <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zayed </PERSON> said: `` I ask my government to release the 17 Islamic Jihad prisoners. If not, they will kill us all.'' Islamic Jihad, or Holy War, is the group that holds <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, and it also is demanding the release of the 17 Kuwaiti prisoners. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, was kidnapped March 16, 1985. He has been held longer than any of the 22 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The hijackers, said to be armed with grenades and guns, have threatened to blow up the plane and kill their remaining hostages if their demands are not met. A ranking Algerian official said Wednesday that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s `` intransigence'' had created the standstill <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s negotiating committee is divided into two teams led by Interior Minister <PERSON> Hedi </PERSON> <PERSON> Khediri </PERSON>. One team is responsible for contacts with the Kuwaitis, and the other with the hijackers. A doctor was allowed on board the plane Thursday to examine the hostages. `` I saw no sign of any illness that required hospitalization or major medicine,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Youssef </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>. He later told the official Algerian news agency that he prescribed some `` routine medicines'' that would be sent to the plane. `` The passengers I saw did not have their hands tied and displayed no signs of physical violence,'' <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> said. An airport crew also went aboard to clean up and serve hot food, the Algerian official said. In a letter Wednesday to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Slaughter </PERSON>, both <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Democrats, wrote: `` We know the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is not a primary party to the <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> negotiations. But if <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s chief kidnapper is on the Kuwaiti jet, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government must ensure that the negotiators are aware of this fact.'' `` It would be a travesty for <PERSON> Imad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mughniyeh </PERSON> to go free while <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> remains a captive,'' they said. The plane landed in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> on Tuesday night. It was moved early Thursday to the end of the runway so another jet could land. It was later returned to its original position about 400 yards from the terminal.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decided Thursday that the case of a young woman who underwent an abortion in defiance of a court order will be heard by a lower court first because there's no longer any urgency. The 18-year-old woman, meanwhile, refused to discuss the matter. `` She would just like to disappear,'' said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beecher </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, attorney for the unmarried Terre Haute woman identified in court documents only as V.J.H. `` She's a very private person. She never imagined that she would have had this publicity.'' The woman's attorneys announced Wednesday that she had undergone an abortion despite a <ORGANIZATION> Vigo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> order prohibiting her from terminating her pregnancy. The order was issued Monday at the request of a 24-year-old Terre Haute truck driver who claimed to be the father. After the court order was issued, attorneys for both sides had asked for an expedited appeal to the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. On Thursday, the justices rejected that request. `` You have to have two things _ a question of great public importance and an emergency situation,'' said court administrator <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulvaney </PERSON>. `` The court's feeling is that clearly there is no emergency any more.'' The case will be heard first by a three-judge panel of the state <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. The case has not been assigned yet, <PERSON> Mulvaney </PERSON> said. Because the case involves a paternity action, the names of the man and the woman are not revealed in court documents. The woman's attorneys dispute the man's claim to be the father <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waples </PERSON>, legal director of the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, argued that previous <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions give the mother sole authority to terminate a pregnancy during the first three months. But <PERSON> Waples </PERSON> said he wanted the injunction issued by <ORGANIZATION> Vigo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> overturned because `` if this order is allowed to go uncorrected, other judges might be tempted to do the same.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bopp </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, attorney for the national Right to Life organization and for the Terre Haute man, said he wants a higher court ruling on whether a father's rights should be weighed against the mother's in such cases. <PERSON> Bobb </PERSON> said in court papers that his client was upset about the abortion and thought the mother terminated the pregnancy for frivolous reasons. <PERSON> Waples </PERSON> said that he has found at least three cases where the mother's right to go ahead and have an abortion despite a court order was ultimately upheld. <PERSON> Bopp </PERSON> said he is n't interested in punishing the woman, and <PERSON> Beecher </PERSON> said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> has indicated he would n't seek a contempt citation, which could carry penalties of a $ 500 fine and 90 days in jail.

<HEAD>Union Leaders Vote To End Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Leaders of two actors' unions voted resoundingly to end a strike that virtually halted production of new radio and TV commercials for more than three weeks, officials announced Thursday. The Screen Actors Guild and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> boards voted 123 to 29 to approve a tentative three-year contract, said <ORGANIZATION> SAG </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Locher </PERSON>. The vote Tuesday and Wednesday must be ratified by the 100,000 members of the two unions, but the strike is being suspended as of Friday morning, <PERSON> Locher </PERSON> said. The unions will mail contract terms and ballots to members next week recommending approval of the contract, he said. The final votes are due back May 20. `` We feel that we achieved the most important principal behind the strike and that was establishing payment for the cable use of commercials which used to be free,'' <PERSON> Locher </PERSON> said. Other terms of the contract, <PERSON> Locher </PERSON> said, include a 10 percent increase in minimum session fees, raising payments from $ 333 to $ 366 for an eight-hour workday; a 13.5 percent increase in radio commercial rates for <ORGANIZATION> AFTRA </ORGANIZATION> members; and an increase in contributions by producers to performers' health and pension plans. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, vice president of the western office of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertising </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agencies </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday afternoon that he had not yet been notified of the settlement. `` I'm sure the -LRB- advertising -RRB- agency community will be thrilled,'' <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said. A call seeking comment from the association's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> headquarters went unanswered Thursday evening. The strike, which began March 21, virtually halted production of new commercials, but ads continued to be broadcast because typical contracts between advertisers and actors allow use of the product for up to 21 months. Commercial work accounted for payments of $ 417 million to actors in 1987, about half the total paid for acting of all kinds.

 Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> on Thursday renewed his attack on Democratic presidential rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for his statement about use of nuclear weapons in the event of a Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>: `` Give me a buzz and I'll tell you exactly what I said.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> met in a one-hour debate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> that served more to highlight their similarities than their differences. Except for the exchanges between <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on nuclear weapons, the forum, sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> WCBS </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Newsday </PERSON> was a low-key, gentlemanly encounter in which the candidates appeared determined to avoid the sharp clashes that have marked the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary campaign. Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> denounced `` litmus tests of race and religion ... spouted from the mouths of public officials'' as one official, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, endorsed <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. Meanwhile, polls put <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on top, with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> trailing and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> at the bottom in the battle for survival in Tuesday's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary. During the debate, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was asked if there were any circumstances under which he would consider using nuclear weapons. The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator used the occasion to renew his criticism of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for saying in a newspaper interview that he would reserve his option to use nuclear weapons in the event of a Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` This is a serious mistake'' said <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, referring to the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> statement. `` It has never been done'' by presidents or presidential candidates. `` Was that an answer to your question?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asked the moderator. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said there was `` a real danger in those of us who may very well lead our country to get trapped into a hypothetical situation on who will shoot your gun first and destroy the whole world to prove that you got macho.'' When <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> raised the issue again later in the debate, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said: `` Do n't pick up the morning newspaper and then have a press conference. Give me a buzz and I'll tell you exactly what I said and there'll be much less confusion.'' Even on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> policy, which has produced sharp differences during the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> campaign, the candidates concentrated on their areas of agreement. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee-to-be <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, keeping to a low-key campaign schedule, ran into a wave of enthusiasm for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> among <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> toddlers. `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'' the children chanted after a reporter shouted a question to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> during the vice president's visit to a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> day care center. With the focus on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> stepped into the spotlight Thursday afternoon to announce his endorsement of <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> as `` a man of intellect, courage and integrity.'' He said, `` <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> is head and shoulders above his rivals'' on Israeli issues. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> reacted mildly to the endorsment, saying in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, `` He likes us both.'' And <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` What he has done by choosing someone is positve and fair and proper.'' But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s tone was quite different when he lashed out at <LOCATION> Koch </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> for what he called `` race-based questions.'' `` We went across the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> on Super Tuesday without a single cat-call or boo, without a single ugly sign at a mass meeting,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` It was not until we got north to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that the litmus tests of race and religion became spouted from the mouths of public officials without a significant media challenge.'' `` There are those who are making race-based statments unfortunately _ whether Mr. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> or Mr. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> or Ms. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said to reporters. `` I simply say some people are making hysteria while I'm making history.'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said recently that Jews would be `` crazy'' to vote for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> because of his positions on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the editors on Wednesday that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been spared criticism because of the fear that comments would be interpreted as `` some kind of racial attack.'' In a Wednesday night speech, Ms. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> lauded <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> but added that if he `` were not black, he would n't be in the race.'' She said he ca n't win the nomination nor the general election. The news from the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> polls was good for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and improving for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> but bad for <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> led <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> by 45 percent to 28 percent in a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll, 46 percent to 34 percent in a <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> poll and 49 percent to 34 percent in an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had only 8 percent support in two polls and 7 percent in the third. Among likely Democratic primary voters, surveyed Monday and Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had the support of 46 percent, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 34 percent, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> 7 percent and `` uncommitted'' 5 percent. Eight percent of those polled were undecided. The poll of 359 people had a potential sampling error of 5 percentage points either way. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> picked up the support of at least 54 of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>'s delegates to the Democratic National Convention in July. That gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a gain of 74 delegates in the past seven days as he continued to pick up strength among the party's unpledged `` super delegates. The latest AP delegate count gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 816.15 to 715.1 for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> trailed with 404.55, while uncommitted delegates totaled 474.75. Sen <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, whose campaign is on hold, had 173.5.

 Thirty-two passengers remained trapped inside a hijacked Kuwaiti jumbo jet for the 10th day today, and Algerian mediators said attempts to negotiate an end to the ordeal had reached a stalemate. Negotiations were suspended after mediators were unable to persuade <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> officials to meet the hijackers' demands, a ranking Algerian official said. Talks with the hijackers were called off at 11:45 p.m. Wednesday -LRB- 6:45 p.m. EDT -RRB- to give negotiators time to rest, and there was no sign of a breakthrough. The hijackers, thought to number about eight, are armed with grenades and guns and have threatened to blow up the plane and kill their hostages.

 The monthly <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit widened by more than 11 percent in February to $ 13.8 billion, the government said Thursday, sending both stock prices and the dollar on a nosedive.

Only concerted intervention by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and central banks in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in buying up large volumes of dollars with yen, marks and British pounds prevented the dollar from falling further.

The dollar's steep dive served served as an ominous reminder to the world's economic powers that their best-laid plans to steady the global economy can be quickly disrupted by events. Just as it had done several times last year, the weakness in the dollar quickly spread to other financial markets, sending interest rates up sharply and pushing the Dow Jones industrial average down by more than 100 points, its second three-digit loss this year.

 The `` average'' American will have to work 126 days this year _ two more than in 1987 _ just to pay federal, state and local taxes, the <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. `` Tax Freedom Day'' will fall on May 5, the latest ever. The best taxpayers have fared in the past decade was in 1984 _ when most of the big 1981 federal income-tax reduction had taken effect _ when Tax Freedom Day fell on April 28, economists for the foundation said. But federal tax increases enacted in 1982, 1984 and 1987 `` have lopped off big chunks of the'81 cuts, and Social Security hikes have made further inroads until, like the <LOCATION> Cheshire </LOCATION> Cat in ` Alice in Wonderland,' nothing remains but the smile,'' the foundation said.

<DATELINE>WALPACK TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The late afternoon sun casts long shadows over the clapboard houses that line Main Street in Walpack Center. It's dead still, but that's not unusual. <LOCATION> Walpack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION> is dying. And Walpack Center, the once-thriving hub of the community, is nearly a ghost town, having faded year by year since the federal government bought up the surrounding countryside to build a dam _ and then changed its mind. `` There seems to be no trace of what was here, like it never happened,'' <PERSON> Township </PERSON> <PERSON> Clerk </PERSON> <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said, as she and her husband, Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, settled into chairs on the glass-enclosed front porch of their home outside <ORGANIZATION> Walpack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was an active community,'' she recalled. `` We had a fire department and a ladies auxilliary. We used to take the bus to the city every now and then. `` It's like it was all erased,'' she added. `` Suits me fine,'' her husband said, trying to appear cantankerous but breaking into booming laughter. Only the municipal building _ an old one-room schoolhouse _ and the rescue squad garage are still owned by the township. The federal government owns the former Methodist church, which is now locked, along with six houses and a post office that make up the rest of <LOCATION> Walpack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Center </LOCATION>. The houses all are painted the same beige with green trim, lending an eerie quality to the silence. The post office is open only two hours, six days a week. Spreading from the township center are acres of what once was pasture. But the farmhouses, the fences and barns are long gone. The death knell for <PERSON> Walpack </PERSON> sounded in 1962 when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> authorized a plan to build a dam at <LOCATION> Tocks </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, a few miles north up the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The idea was to create a 12,000-acre lake along 37 miles of the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jervis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, to the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Water Gap. The federal government spent $ 9 million on engineering for the proposed dam between <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. An additional $ 75.2 million bought land for the lake and a surrounding park. The lake was to be used for recreation and water supply, while the dam would provide hydroelectric power and flood control. But <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> never appropriated money to build the dam because of environmental and economic objections. In 1978, it turned the project over from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which is turning the land and river into the 69,000-acre <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gap </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION>. The federal government now owns all but about 5,000 acres of the land it intends to incorporate into the park. That land, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, is still privately owned. The <ORGANIZATION> Fullers </ORGANIZATION>, whose home is on a half-acre plot, are among about 90 residents left in <LOCATION> Walpack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>, a 45-square-mile community that falls entirely within the recreation area. The <ORGANIZATION> Fullers </ORGANIZATION>, both 62, say they intend to stay in <LOCATION> Walpack </LOCATION>, and serve as mayor and clerk, as long as they are able. They wo n't sell out to the government, as their neighbors did. `` People think we're crazy for staying, but it's great,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said, gazing across a deep ravine to the pines on a far ridge. The government's objective for the area is to `` provide opportunities for outdoor recreation,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ring </PERSON>, the park service's assistant superintendent of the area. `` Probably got just as much use before,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said. `` More,'' said her husband. But Ring says 2.5 million people visit the recreation area annually to hunt, fish, swim, ride bikes, hike and go boating and canoeing on the river. Officials expect the number to double in the next decade, he said. To accommodate the visitors, the park service plans to set up restrooms, picnic areas, refreshment stands, boat landings and trails for hiking and biking. `` There also are a number of historic facilities that folks can come and tour,'' Ring said. Among those historic facilities are homes once owned by people like the <ORGANIZATION> Fullers </ORGANIZATION>. The buildings in Walpack Center may eventually house country inns, craft shops, art galleries, museums, restaurants or `` other facilities consistent with the -LRB- government's -RRB- objectives for the area,'' Ring said. Thousands of other houses, that were deemed to have no historic or cultural value, were torn down. `` We fought it like the devil,'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said of opposition to the federal plans. <PERSON> Walpack </PERSON>, established in the 1750s, had a year-round population of about 375 in the early 1960s, with numbers swelling to about 3,000 in the summer, the <ORGANIZATION> Fullers </ORGANIZATION> said. Most residents were dairy farmers and most summer people came for the fishing and hunting, or the solitude. `` Sometimes it's hard to remember what it was like,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said.

 These are the best of times and the worst of times for <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the flamboyant speaker of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Assembly </LOCATION> and national chairman of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s presidential campaign They are heady times for <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> as the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign continues to exceed expectations and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> emerges as a serious contender for the Democratic nomination for president. They are also tough times for <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> as he is under siege as never before on his home turf, in the halls of the state Capitol, where his 7 -LCB- - year rule of the Assembly is in danger <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> voices quiet confidence in both arenas. In the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign, he modestly understates his current role or potential influence at the Democratic National Convention. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> political circles, his public calm conceals a desperate battle to hold his powerful office. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s appointment as <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s national chairman last November was widely reported as a major boost to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign. As the black leader of a predominately white legislative body and as a pre-eminent fund-raiser for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Democrats, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was seen as someone possessing the political skills, prestige, experience and contacts <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> needed most to broaden his constituency among white political leaders and voters. That's exactly what has happened to the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign. And while <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> publicly gives all of the credit to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, his influence in the campaign appears strong, and <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> is increasingly being viewed as a key player in picking the next Democratic nominee if the convention becomes deadlocked. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who originally backed <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> for the 1988 nomination, acknowledges that he was initially attracted to the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign as a vehicle to `` get in the room'' of major players who would pick the Democratic nominee if the convention deadlocked. `` I need to get a horse with 1,000 chits -LRB- delegates -RRB- to get in the room. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> looks like my best agent,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> as saying a year ago. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> confirmed that quote earlier this month, but said `` I'm beyond that now,'' and that his goal is `` trying to secure the nomination for Mr <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.'' `` I've been there once, -LRB- in the inner circle picking a presidential nominee -RRB- and I'm going to be back,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said, referring to 1972, when he co-chaired the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> delegation which was key to winning the nomination for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> claims to have raised $ 1 million for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a good chunk of the candidate's overall treasury. And he talks regularly by telephone to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a compulsive caller. But while <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s potential influence on national politics is greater than ever before, his political base is <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> is crumbling. The 54-year-old <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who was raised in a one-room house in racially segregated <LOCATION> Mineola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tex. </LOCATION>, hitchhiked to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> after high school and worked as a janitor while living with an uncle and attending college and law school. He started a storefront law practice in 1959 which, by his own description, was primarily `` pimps and prostitutes,'' and became active in civil rights demonstrations. Within five years, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, then 30, had won a seat in the state Assembly. By 1971, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a powerful fiscal post which paradoxically made <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> nominally the legislative author of then-Gov. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s state budgets. Then, in a 1980 coalition with the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> minority, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> defeated two other Democrats to become Assembly speaker, an office which the late <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Unruh </PERSON> had transformed a decade earlier from a ceremonial presiding officer's job into a fund-raising and policy-making post second in influence only to the governor. The speaker's office, replete with both the subtle and overt trappings of power, fit <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> like a glove. His wit and flamboyant style made him an instant success as a fund-raiser, helping him raise up to $ 5 million annually for other Democrats, thereby cementing his hold on the office and freeing him from dependence on a coalition with Republicans. Being speaker, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said, was like being `` the Ayatollah of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' with power to set the legislative agenda and assign or remove colleagues from legislative committees. It also gave him an office in the Capitol he describes as `` bigger than my home town,'' which matched nicely the taste for lavish parties, $ 1,000 suits and $ 100,000 sports cars which <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> acquired as his private law practice has evolved from criminal to corporate. But as the Democratic majority in the 80-seat Assembly has slipped under <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> from 47 to the current 44 seats, complaints grew that his flamboyance and sometimes embarrassing remarks were hurting Democrats more than his fund-raising was helping them. This came to a head earlier this year when five conservative Assembly Democrats, motivated by a variety of relatively obscure personal disagreements with <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, bolted his leadership. Without their support, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> retains the title and outward trappings of the speakership, but without a working majority. The five have aligned themselves with Republicans to push anti-abortion, death penalty and wiretap bills which <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> previously bottled up in committee, and they have even defeated routine legislative housekeeping rules backed by <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> at first punished the five, stripping them of most legislative duties and banishing them to smaller Capitol offices. More recently, he has ignored or downplayed the defeats, contending it never was his intent to dictate policy. The five dissident Democrats, who hold the balance of power in the Assembly, say they have no intention now of trying to oust <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. `` Why should we? We are controlling the policy agenda,'' says one of the five, Democrat <PERSON> Rusty </PERSON> <PERSON> Areias </PERSON>. That means <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> can probably continue to occupy the speaker's office until the current Assembly session adjourns Aug. 31 <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> says he will re-elected speaker next year. But unless he wins back the five dissident Democrats, his hopes for another term as speaker depend on either winning at least two more Democratic seats this year to create a majority not dependent on the five rebels or forging another coalition with Republicans. As Sacramento-based political columnist <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> puts it, `` There is a growing sense in the Capitol that <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s days as speaker are numbered. But no one has figured out the number yet.''

<HEAD>Business Leaders' Confidence Rises In First Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Confidence among top business executives in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy following October's stock market crash has rebounded, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. During the first quarter, the business research group's measure of business confidence ticked up to 51 after falling to a five-year low of 47 in the final quarter of 1987, the group said Wednesday. The measure reflects a scale of 0 to 100. More than a third of the 1,000 executives polled said they expect to have greater problems finding qualified employees this year than in the previous year. The <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said nearly 20 percent of the executives polled expect employment in their industries to rise this year, but 29 percent expect job losses. Business services and the instruments and primary metals industries hold the brightest employment prospects, while banking, gas and electric utilities and the insurance industry are likely to be hit with job losses, the board reported. `` The moderate rise in business executives' confidence parallels an upturn in consumer confidence during the first quarter,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Malin </PERSON>. `` A strong irony in the latest survey is that all of the increased optimism revolves around likely business conditions later this year, not now,'' he added.

 Share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> reached new highs again on Thursday morning, while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar rose marginally against the Japanese yen in early foreign exchange activity. The bellwether Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues climbed for the fourth consecutive day, adding another 67.52 points to Wednesday's record close to finish the morning session at 27,053.07. It was the first time the Nikkei average ever topped 27,000, surpassing its previous intraday high of 26,988.36 points hit in early trading on Monday. The Nikkei index has come within five points of the 27,000 mark in intraday trading three times this week, but slipped back each time amid the continuing market rally. In currency trading, the dollar opened at 126.20 yen, down 0.25 yen from Wednesday's finish, but later edged higher and was changing hands at 126.35 yen by late morning. <PERSON> Fumihiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Morimoto </PERSON> of the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> said the market was supported by continued strength on Wall Street and somewhat by the agreement among the seven top industrialized nations to continue cooperating to keep the dollar from falling further. In a two-page joint communique after a meeting Wednesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the finance ministers and central bank governors of the seven nations announced the extension of a Dec. 22 agreement in which they pledged to stabilize the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. The so-called Group of Seven nations are the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. A dealer at a major <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> investment firm, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the foreign exchange market likely would be affected more by the release Thursday of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures for February. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit has affected the dollar's direction in recent months because the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration has supported a lower dollar as a way of narrowing the gap.

 The flying public, already wary of financially-troubled <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, could be driven further away by the government's unprecedented special investigation of the nation's biggest airline company, observers say. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday it would investigate whether <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and its management were `` fit, willing and able'' to carry commercial air traffic. The government has investigated small airlines and has revoked the operating licenses of some minor carriers, but analysts say the <ORGANIZATION> DOT </ORGANIZATION>'s new inquiry is the first involving major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, an industry giant with a commanding 20 percent of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air traffic, is the parent company of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. The federal probe, added to the company's financial and labor headaches, could drive still more passengers away as <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s tarnished image deteriorates further `` It's quite serious,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cammisa </PERSON>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indicators </ORGANIZATION>, an industry newsletter. `` Both -LRB- Eastern and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- are suffering from image problems now, anyway.'' <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> stock dropped more than $ 1 a share, to $ 10.75, on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> when news of the <ORGANIZATION> DOT </ORGANIZATION> investigation hit the market. The stock closed at $ 10.87 -LCB-, down 87 -LCB- cents from Tuesday. In a separate action on Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> announced a civil penalty of $ 823,000 against Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> because of `` recurring trends'' of violations of safety regulations. The fine was imposed just over a year after <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay a $ 9.5 million penalty in connection with other safety violations. The latest fine is based on findings from an investigation in September and October, but Eastern now has an opportunity to challenge it. If the airline can produce evidence the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> considers valid, the fine could be reduced. `` No airline likes to raise the specter of safety at all,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, an industry analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. He said it's difficult to estimate how many people would not fly the airline as a result of the negative publicity surrounding the federal probe. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and its aggressive chairman, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, have been locking horns with unions at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> over proposed pay cuts and other labor issues. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> put Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> into bankruptcy in 1983 and emerged with a non-union airline. The <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> carriers have a debt of around $ 5.4 billion, but <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has set up a corporate structure that insulates the parent company from most of the burden. The company sustained record losses of $ 466 million last year. His hard-nosed tactics, including stringent cost-cutting and periodically triggering fare wars, have caused bitter conflicts with the company's unions and in other quarters. More than 150 congressmen recently supported a resolution in favor of a probe of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. If the <ORGANIZATION> DOT </ORGANIZATION> determines <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> is unfit to carry traffic, the agency could revoke its operating license, suggested Dr. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>, the architect of deregulation of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline industry in 1978. But <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> and others noted the <ORGANIZATION> DOT </ORGANIZATION> does n't have legal authority to force out <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> and other managers approved by the company's shareholders `` We ought to be damned careful that this is an honest inquiry, not a political one,'' said <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>, now a professor of political economy at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ithaca </LOCATION>, N.Y.

 Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> said today the federal investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and its subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> should be considered a `` shot across the bow'' of any airline that might compromise safety due to financial pressures. Meanwhile, an Eastern official blamed the investigation announced Wednesday on pressure from unions. <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> also said that air travelers should be greatly reassured by a planned month-long safety probe of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s fleet, saying it could bring `` the safest 30 days in the history of that airline or almost any airline in <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. history.'' <LOCATION> Burnley </LOCATION>, interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show, said he would not hesitate to fly Eastern despite the investigation and a proposed $ 823,000 fine he announced. <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials have not been satisfied with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s performance since it was taken over by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> 14 months ago. `` They've made a lot of progress on the safety side, on the maintenance side, but we do n't know that they're quite where we want them to be,'' he said. `` We've got to be absolutely certain that no airline is building up financial pressures that cause anybody in the company to think that there's any reason to cut on the safety side,'' <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said. `` If there's any other airline in this country which is even contemplating that strategy, I certainly hope that they take this as a shot across the bow.'' Eastern President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> blamed the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> action on pressure from unions which have raised public safety issues during negotiations with the airlines. Bakes said on `` CBS This Morning'' that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has invested $ 150 million more in maintenance since the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> takeover. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has been under enormous political pressure because of the union negotiations,'' he said. Eastern ran full-page ads in newspapers today, including <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, saying it welcomed the probe because it will show the airline is operating safely and has been unfairly treated by federal authorities. `` We're confident the outcome will be a very good one,'' Bakes said. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> called both investigations unwarranted and blamed them on pressure from union leaders who `` have mounted a continuing campaign of distortion and lies'' about safety at both <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and another subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Continental is the country's fourth largest airline, while Eastern is the sixth largest. Together they carry nearly 20 percent of the nation's air traffic. Eastern has for months been embroiled in a bitter confrontation with its labor unions, which are resisting management's call for significant contract concessions and which accused <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> of syphoning off the most profitable parts of the airline. In announcing the two-pronged action against <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and its airline subsidiaries, <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> cited evidence in recent company filings to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that both <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> `` are under substantial, increasing financial pressure.'' The department wants to determine if <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and its management are `` fit, willing and able'' to carry commercial air traffic, <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said at a news conference also attended by <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON>. <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said the new <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> safety review of Eastern was being conducted because of concern about the `` continuing pattern of fines, safety violations and apparent insensitivity of some of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s officials'' to <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> safety regulations. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> inspection would include examination of each of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s 267 aircraft over the next 30 days. The $ 823,000 civil penalty against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> comes 14 months after <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay $ 9.5 million in penalties because of earlier safety infractions. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials said the latest fine stems from record keeping and maintenance infractions similar to those found in the earlier action. The latest fine is based on findings from an investigation last September and October, but Eastern now has an opportunity to challenge it. If the airline can produce evidence the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> considers valid, the fine could be reduced. Bakes called the latest <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> action unfair and expressed concern that it may prompt some travelers not to fly Eastern. Last month, passenger revenue at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> dropped 20 percent compared to March 1987, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> had record losses of $ 466 million last year and has an overall debt of about $ 5.4 billion. Nevertheless, the Houston-based company said in a statement Wednesday that it `` remains financially strong with over $ 850 million in cash at the end of the first quarter.'' But news of the federal investigation caused <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> stock to drop more than $ 1 a share, to $ 10.75, on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> during trading Wednesday. The stock finally closed at $ 10.87 -LCB-, down 87 -LCB- cents from Tuesday. There has been increasing sentiment in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in recent months for a closer examination of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. A resolution urging such a probe has gained the support of more than 150 congressmen. <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said concern about <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s health was heightened by recent financial filings by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. `` The recent activities of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and its carriers _ particularly <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> _ raise questions concerning whether the carriers can and are disposed to comply with the safety and economic rules applicable to air carriers,'' the department said in its order for an investigation. It said a number of financial transactions between <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and the two subsidiary airlines `` raise questions concerning whether substantial funds and other resources are being diverted from the air carrier subsidiaries.'' The department questioned, for example: _ <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> shifting <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s profitable computer reservation system into a separate subsidiary in exchange for a note `` which may be less than the system's fair market value.'' _ Eastern paying `` substantial fees'' for management services, fuel purchases and other activities provided by the parent company. _ Eastern accepting a no-interest note, instead of cash, for $ 16 million in reimbursements owed to the airline as part of its acquisition by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. _ <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> borrowing $ 25 million from Eastern in March 1987 in exchange for an unsecured note at a time when <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> was having cash flow problems.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> has ordered six advanced-model 747-400 jumbo jets and placed options on four more planes in a deal worth more than $ 1.5 billion, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced. The airline also made public Wednesday a previously unannounced $ 374 million order for a 747-300 Combi and two 747-200 freighters to be delivered later this year. The package, which totals more than $ 1.9 million, includes spare parts and support, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> KAL </ORGANIZATION> already has three 747-400s on order for delivery beginning in April 1989. Deliveries of the new -400 series orders will continue into 1994. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrontz </PERSON> announced the sale in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> KAL </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> C.K </PERSON>. Cho. The order was a boost for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> after recent criticism from three major customers. <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, All <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> have complained recently of poor workmanship in <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 and 767 jetliners. <PERSON> Shrontz </PERSON> met earlier this week in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> with the president of <ORGANIZATION> JAL </ORGANIZATION>, who wrote him last month about defects, but details of the discussion were not released. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> executive vice president <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Condit </PERSON> responded to the criticism on Tuesday, saying the company builds safe airplanes and that letters about quality concerns are not unusual. The new 747-400 features improved range, fuel economy, aerodynamics and avionics. <PERSON> Cho </PERSON> said the planes were ordered because of the airline's expected growth and need for airplanes with `` a high standard of reliability and comfort. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> contracts were in line with <ORGANIZATION> KAL </ORGANIZATION>'s long-term program to organize worldwide service networks and improve its competitiveness in the world airline market, <ORGANIZATION> KAL </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> said. The contracts also were part of <ORGANIZATION> KAL </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to prepare for an expected sharp increase in air travelers following a recent <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government decision to ease restrictions on foreign trips by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION>, the officials said. Test flights of the first 747-400, which rolled out of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> factory in a ceremony in late January, have been delayed because of electrical problems On Tuesday, company officials said they expected the plane to begin flight testing by the end of this month and be certified by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> before the year's end. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> said deliveries of the first four -400 s, two each to <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Singapore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, still are expected in December The jumbo jets ordered by <ORGANIZATION> KAL </ORGANIZATION> will carry up to 398 passengers in a three-class arrangement. The airline said the new planes will be able to carry a full passenger and cargo payload non-stop between <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> KAL </ORGANIZATION> order brings 747-400 orders to 124 planes with a value of nearly $ 15 billion.

 The stock market took a sharp drop today, faced with the surprise news of an increase in the nation's trade deficit. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled 37.30 points to 2,069.79 in the first half hour of trading. Losers swamped gainers by more than 12 to 1 in the early tally of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 91 up, 1,160 down and 203 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 32.71 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street.

That came as a big disappointment to market participants, who had been looking for a continued narrowing in the gap between imports and exports. The dollar dropped sharply in foreign exchange markets on the news, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> credit markets also took the news badly. Prices of long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds fell about $ 15 for each $ 1,000 in face value, putting their yields in the 8.85-8 .9 percent range Just a few weeks ago government bond yields got as low as about 8.3 percent. Stock-market analysts said persistent strength in imports, in particular, raised fears that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might soon feel the need to tighten credit to restrain the economy as well as to support the dollar.

 The dollar plummeted in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> today after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government reported the American merchandise trade deficit unexpectedly widened in February. Gold prices dropped during the morning session. The dollar fell almost two and a half cents against the British pound, nearly three pfennigs against the West German mark and more than two and a half Japanese yen after the trade report. The tumbling <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency compelled several major central banks to intervene and buy dollars to cushion the fall, traders reported. The merchandise trade deficit widened to $ 13.83 billion in February from $ 12.44 billion in January, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Economists had expected the deficit to narrow to between $ 11.2 billion $ 11.8 billion. Dealers said the dollar was not affected by Wednesday's announcement by finance ministers and central bankers of the seven major monetary nations that they had reaffirmed their December commitment to stabilizing exchange rates The move was widely expected and had already been discounted in the market, dealers said. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell marginally to 126.15 yen, closing 0.30 yen lower than Wednesday. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 123.75 compared 126.30 yen in the morning. `` The news of the -LRB- Group of Seven -RRB- meeting was nothing substantial,'' said a dealer at a major <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> investment firm in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Here are dollar rates after the trade report was released, with midmorning rates in parentheses and compared with late Wednesday: 1.6650 -LRB- 1.6920 -RRB- West German marks, down from 1.6895; 1.3745 -LRB- 1.4010 -RRB- Swiss francs, down from 1.3983; 5.6510 -LRB- 5.7385 -RRB- <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> francs, down from 5.7295; 1.8740 -LRB- 1.8972 -RRB- Dutch guilders, down from 1.8950; 1,238.45 -LRB- 1,254.00 -RRB- Italian lire, down from 1,252.50; 1.2382 -LRB- 1.2371 -RRB- Canadian dollars, up from 1.23675. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound cost $ 1.8675, compared with $ 1.8420 earlier in the day and $ 1.8445 dollars late Wednesday. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 446.85 a troy ounce, down from late Wednesday's $ 449.25, and at midmorning today the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 447. Bullion dealers said trading was quiet as the market waited for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, the bid price for gold was $ 447, down from $ 449.50 late Wednesday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 1.34 to close at a bid $ 449.48. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today at a bid price of $ 6.34 a troy ounce, down from Wednesday's $ 6.41.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit widened unexpectedly in February to $ 13.8 billion, its biggest shortfall since October, the government said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the excess of imports over exports rose $ 1.4 billion from January's $ 12.4 billion imbalance. The dollar fell shortly after the announcement and on Wall Street, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average was down about 38 points to about 2069, reflecting traders' disappointment with the news. Financial markets had expected the deficit to shrink slightly. For the first two months of 1988, the deficit ran at an annual rate of $ 157.6 billion, below the record $ 171.2 billion of last year but still worse than second highest imbalance of $ 156.2 billion in 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. Imports of foreign manufactured goods, oil and farm products increased by $ 2.3 billion in February. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports also rose, but by a smaller $ 1.3 billion from January. In another report today, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said business inventories rose a slight 0.1 percent in February, much slower than the pace in recent months. The department said the gain in inventories pushed them up by $ 825 million during February to a seasonally adjusted $ 715.9 billion. The gain came as total business sales were climbing 0.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 468.3 billion in February, reversing a 0.5 percent decline in January. On Wednesday, top finance ministers of seven major industrial nations said the countries will keep working to stabilize the value of the dollar against other major currencies. The finance ministers and central bankers of the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> nations </ORGANIZATION> also announced they would develop a plan to use gold and other commodities as a way of measuring inflation pressures. Mindful of investors' continued uneasiness at any signs of disunity, the finance leaders went out of their way in their joint statement to emphasize their strong desire to cooperate with each other in keeping the global economy from toppling into a recession. The statement reaffirmed a Dec. 22 agreement that had been issued after long-distance discussions in which the seven countries pledged to work together to keep the dollar from falling further against major currencies. The dollar rose against most other major currencies Wednesday although most traders stayed on the sidelines waiting for today's trade deficit figures The group meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consists of finance ministers and central bank leaders from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. In their first face-to-face meeting since before the October stock crash, the finance ministers also were critical of the newly industrialized nations of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> for not doing enough to reduce global trade imbalances. In other economic news on Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said retail sales rose 0.8 percent in March and automakers said sales of domestic cars and light trucks fell 10.8 percent in early April compared with a year earlier. The drop in auto sales came after three months of unexpectedly strong results. One analyst, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, described it as a `` hiccup.'' Retail sales were helped by Easter buying at department and food stores. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it was the fifth consecutive monthly increase and the largest since December. On Wall Street, stock prices retreated slightly as the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average fell 2.98 points to 2,107.10. It was the first Dow decline after gains totaling more than 129 points in six sessions.

 Entertainer <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> has reached an agreement to buy <ORGANIZATION> Resorts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> from property developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, ending a much-publicized takeover battle, the two dealmakers said today. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> this morning to meet with state gaming regulators, said he and <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> came to the agreement after a day-long meeting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Wednesday. Shareholders other than <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> would be paid $ 36 a share under the plan, giving the deal an indicated value of about $ 206 million. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, who paid $ 135 a share for his stake in the company, also is getting paid in cash, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nusbaum </PERSON>, the developer's attorney But he would not provide details of the payment to <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> except to say his client is `` pleased he is making a profit.'' Under terms reached between the two high-living businessmen, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> would acquire Resorts' troubled 1,250-room Taj Mahal hotel and casino project under construction in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to add to his battery of gaming operations. He also would acquire other unidentified assets. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, who hosted the `` <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> Show'' for 23 years, would control the existing Resorts Hotel and Casino in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and all <LOCATION> Paradise </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> operations in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. The agreement ends a lengthy jousting match that observers initially expected would see <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> emerge as the victor. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, who controls Resorts through his 95 percent ownership of the company's outstanding Class B shares, had been trying to take the company private for $ 22 a share since February <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, who began bidding for a majority stake in Resorts last month, had been spurned repeatedly by <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. In a joint statement issued in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> and <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> said: `` We are extremely pleased that the future of Resorts may finally have been resolved in a manner which benefit the public shareholders of Resorts and each of us.'' They said they planned to meet with the Resorts board `` as soon as possible'' to outline their agreement. <PERSON> Nusbaum </PERSON> called the accord `` one of those rare agreements that is good for all parties.'' He noted that <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s main interest in Resorts had been for the Taj Mahal, `` which -LRB- Trump -RRB- thinks is the crown jewel of <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> said he would meet with members of the state <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the Division of Gaming Enforcement today and expected to exchange `` a lot of pleasantries.'' If the deal is completed, <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> will acquire 5.7 million Class A shares and the 40,000 Class B shares not owned by <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> developer maintained a controlling interest in Resorts because his Class B shares each carried 100 votes.

 The world's top financial leaders today tried to put the best face on a surprisingly large <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit in an effort to calm currency markets thrown into disarray by the unexpected dose of bad news. The dollar plunged immediately after the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the imbalance between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports and exports surged to $ 13.8 billion in February, the highest monthly imbalance since the record October figure. The trade deficit report came one day after the world's seven major industrial countries held high-level talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and pledged renewed cooperation to support the value of the dollar at current levels. Before today's trade report, the seven countries had been successful for four months in their efforts to stabilize the greenback. Basking in that success, the seven nations had issued a glowing communique on Wednesday in which they renewed their commitment to use intervention as a way to keep the dollar from falling further. Intervention is the process by which governments buy currencies on the open market in order to prop up their value. The bad trade number immediately tested the economic powers' resolve as the dollar plunged precipitously, dropping below a level of 125 yen That benchmark is considered to be the target the industrial powers are aiming at in their dollar-stabilization drive. Currency traders reported that the central banks of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> were intervening today in an effort to break the dollar's fall. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, the prime architect of a three-year effort to manage currency exchange rates, was grim-faced and said nothing as he arrived for today's session of finance ministers, being held as part of the spring meeting of the 151-nation <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. While <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> did not talk to reporters before the closed-door sessions began, a text of his remarks to the finance ministers was released later. In those comments, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> played down the significance of the February surge in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. `` The trade figures released this morning should be seen in context. As we have said before, too much emphasis should not be placed on any one month's figures,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` Monthly trade figures are by their nature erratic.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the important thing to realize was that the overall trend pointed to an improving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade performance this year. He said one of the reasons for this optimistic view was the success that the major industrial countries have had in coordinating an economic policy. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has made great strides in cutting the federal budget deficit while <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have all taken significant actions to boost domestic growth, efforts that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has long urged as a way of increasing the demand for American products. West German Finance Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> also tried to play down the significance of the one-month surge in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. `` It is a monthly figure. We do not expect that it will change the basic trend,'' <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said during a break in the closed-door talks. Asked if the countries would now be forced to set a new base level for the dollar, considering the fact that it had dropped below the 125-yen level, <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said, `` That is a very good question, a thousand-dollar question.'' Neither <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON>, the head of the West German central bank, would confirm that central banks were intervening today to support the dollar. But <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said, `` The central banks will cooperate. There is no doubt. We announced it yesterday.'' The so-called Group of Seven, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, issued a two-page communique Wednesday reaffirming their Dec. 22 pact to keep the international value of the dollar stable. But today's new assault on the dollar served to emphasize just how difficult it may be to uphold that commitment. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its six allies decided in September 1985 to push the dollar lower to correct <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s huge trade deficit, but the countries have been trying since February 1987 to halt the currency's decline. The effort did not meet with much success last year, and the steadily deteriorating dollar was cited as one of the reasons the world's financial markets were thrown into turmoil last October. But since Dec. 22, the major industrial countries have crafted a new strategy to stabilize the dollar and that agreement has held for the past four months, backed up by periodic intervention in currency markets, the process of buying the dollar to prop up its value. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> first unveiled his commodity price indicator at the last meeting of the seven countries' finance leaders in September. Some nations expressed skepticism then, wondering whether the idea was a veiled effort to re-introduce a gold standard. But <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> picked up enough converts to get the proposal endorsed, although other finance ministers stressed that many details of the plan, including just what commodities to include, still remain to be worked out. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has insisted that his approach is not an effort to return to the gold-based monetary system that existed between the end of World War II and 1973. For most of that time, the price of gold was fixed at $ 35 an ounce and the currencies of other governments were set at fixed rates based on the dollar. President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> broke the link with gold in 1973 as the so-called <PERSON> Bretton </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> system crumbled under the weight of rising inflation and large trade imbalances. In another victory for <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, the joint statement Wednesday singled out the newly industrialized countries in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> for criticism for their continued high trade surpluses. It urged those nations to do more to lower their own barriers to other countries' exports and to allow their currencies to rise in value in relation to the dollar These developments are seen as critical by the administration if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is to make progess this year in reducing its trade deficit, which hit a record $ 171 billion in 1987. Almost one-fourth of that total came in trade with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>.

 Stock prices tumbled today on the surprise news of an increase in the nation's trade deficit. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 32.50 points to 2,074.60 by noontime today on Wall Street. Losers swamped gainers by more than 7 to 1 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 182 up, 1,313 down and 334 unchanged. Before the market opened the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the nation's trade deficit widened to $ 13.83 billion in February from $ 12.44 billion the month before. That came as a big disappointment to market participants, who had been looking for a continued narrowing in the gap between imports and exports. The dollar dropped sharply in foreign exchange markets on the news, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> credit markets also took the news badly. Prices of long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds fell about $ 15 for each $ 1,000 in face value, putting their yields in the 8.85-8 .9 percent range Just a few weeks ago government bond yields got as low as about 8.3 percent. Stock-market analysts said persistent strength in imports, in particular, raised fears that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might soon feel the need to tighten credit to restrain the economy as well as to support the dollar. Among actively traded blue chips, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> dropped -LCB- to 115 |; <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION> 1 -RCB- to 85 -LCB-; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> 1 to 41 ~; <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> 1 to 46 -LRB-, and <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> 1 -LRB- to 33 The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks fell 2.13 to 151.07.

 The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>, which has been giving wrong answers to about 28 of every 100 telephoned tax questions, today offered taxpayers some tips on how to avoid penalties for following such bad advice. Penalties imposed for late filing of a return, negligence or failure to pay taxes due may be waived if taxpayers can show reasonable cause for their actions that led to the penalties, the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> said that in weighing whether a taxpayer who got erroneous advice acted reasonably, it will consider: _ Whether the taxpayer tried to get the correct answer to a tax question from tax forms, instructions or official publications _ The actual question asked of and specific facts given to an <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> telephone `` assister. _ The specific answer given the taxpayer The agency indicated the taxpayer's case would be helped if he or she took down the name of the employee who gave the bad advice and the date and time of the call. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> said it is unlikely to waive penalties for paying taxes with a bad check or for understating tax liability by more than $ 5,000.

 A federal grand jury has returned an 86-count indictment against 12 individuals charging them with conducting one of the largest tax-shelter frauds ever prosecuted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, officials announced Thursday. The indictment charges that defendants involved in a tax shelter promoted <ORGANIZATION> OEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leasing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, in tax years 1982 and 1983. The indictment said the 12 obtained at least $ 30 million from more than 4,000 taxpayers, costing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> a potential revenue loss of at least $ 65 million. The indictment also charges that a tax shelter promoted by <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leasing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Melville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, obtained at least $ 14 million from more than 1,900 taxpayers and cost the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> a potential revenue loss of at least $ 23 million. Three of the 12 defendants, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuffrida </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Belle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Terre </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuffrida </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dix </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, are charged with racketeering in the form of mail fraud and interstate transportation of securities and money. All 12 defendants, including those three, are charged with conspiracy to defraud the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, aiding the filing of false tax returns, mail fraud and interstate transportation of securities and money taken by fraud. Others charged in the indictment, released at a news conference of the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's Office, are: _ <PERSON> Zayle </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleary </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Levittown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeRaffele </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rochelle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Cherry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Crystal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Enden </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcie </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Coram </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Oster </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Miller </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Place </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> S.G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said the case developed from leads that <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said arrests would begin immediately. `` This prosecution involves a very sophisticated attempt to lure taxpayers into making investments that would, according to their promoters, result in many times the investment in tax savings,'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said. According to the scheme, investors would buy an energy-saving device for $ 5,000, which they could use to obtain investment and energy tax credits to save $ 20,000 to $ 30,000 in taxes during the first year, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said.

 Billionaire developer <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Leona </PERSON>, the self-styled hotel queen, were arraigned today on tax evasion charges in state court, where they loudly proclaimed their innocence. The Helmsleys, in ringing voices, replied, `` Not guilty,'' when asked how they pleaded to charges involving the disguising of millions of dollars in renovation costs for their estate as business expenses. Also pleading innocent were <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Turco </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s former top aide, and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Licari </PERSON>, the couple's former financial manager. All four also were named in a 47-count federal indictment containing similar charges. That indictment also charges Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Turco </PERSON> with extortion conspiracy; they allegedly received kickbacks by threatening suppliers with a cutoff of <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> business and by threatening <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> employees with loss of their jobs. State prosecutors had asked that the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> each be required to post $ 1 million bail, and that bail for their aides be set at $ 100,000. But acting state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkman </PERSON> released them on their own recognizance. A June 1 court date was set. The trial-level judge said she was angry because news of the indictments leaked earlier in the week. `` I am asking Mr. -LRB- Robert -RRB- <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> -LRB- the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> district attorney -RRB- to investigate this grand jury leak. A crime has been committed. This particular grand jury was under my supervision, and I am quite upset that this information was leaked to the press,'' she said. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, 80, and his 68-year-old wife are one of the world's wealthiest couples Their holdings, including the Empire State Building and the Helmsley Palace Hotel, are worth an estimated $ 1.4 billion. The couple arrived at the attorney general's office to surrender in a gray limousine, followed by a second limousine carrying their own security people. They said `` Good morning'' to reporters; when one reporter asked <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> what his greatest achievement had been, he answered, `` Marrying her.'' From the attorney general's office, the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> were taken to police headquarters for booking and then to <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. In the courtroom, the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> sat quietly in the front row as drug dealers and thieves were arraigned, and exchanged words from time to time. The state indictment against each defendant included 139 counts of falsifying business records; 44 counts of offering a false instrument for filing; three counts of scheme to defraud; one count of conspiracy; and one misdemanor count of scheme to defraud. The indictment said the crimes were committed between 1982 and 1986. The charges in the federal indictment include conspiracy, income tax evasion, filing false and fraudulent income tax returns, mail fraud and, for Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Turco </PERSON>, conspiracy to commit extortion. The Helmsleys are accused of disguising millions of dollars in renovation costs on their <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, mansion as business expenses and writing the bills off as tax deductions. Approximately $ 4 million was used to refurbish the mansion. That money bought an enclosure for one of the estate's two pools; a breakfast room and marble dance floor on the roof of that enclosure; installation of an elaborate indoor-outdoor stereo system; more than $ 200,000 in landscaping; and an assortment of furniture and paintings. In addition, a $ 45,000 birthday present for <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> was billed to and paid by the Park Lane Hotel in December 1984, and one or more jade art objects worth $ 500,000 were paid for by four <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hotels as furniture purchases in 1984, according to the charges. The federal indictment says there were four jade objects, and estimates the value of the landscaping work at $ 370,000. On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION>' attorney, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, denounced the tax-cheating accusations `` unfounded, unfair and unjust.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> have paid more taxes to the government over the years than practically any other individual in this city or country,'' <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> said. `` In the last five years alone they have paid more than $ 250 million in taxes.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> and state Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> mounted a joint investigation into the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION>' taxes 18 months ago. There were indications of legal action against the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, when they obtained a show cause order and filed a writ of prohibition against <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> in state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The papers were sealed by the judge, so it was not known what the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> sought. A writ of prohibition can bar public officials from actions ordinarily in their power, such as an indictment or grand jury appearance. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, who is featured in ads as the `` queen'' of a string of hotels owned by her and her husband, turned down a deal from prosecutors, who said they would not seek the indictment of her husband if she pleaded guilty to fraud, a law enforcement source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>.

 Share prices tumbled Thursday after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government reported a wider-than-expected trade deficit for February. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 23.2 points, or 1.3 percent, lower at 1,787.2, after trading as high as 1,826.8, or 16.4 points up, ahead of the trade report. Dealers said the $ 13.83 billion trade deficit in February, compared with a deficit of $ 12.44 billion in January, renewed fears of a sharp downturn in stocks worldwide. The October stock markets' crash followed a poor <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade report. Volume was moderate at 517.3 million shares, down from 523.4 million on Wednesday. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> shares were buoyed in morning business on continued buying interest on news of British takeovers. But all was lost in a matter of minutes when the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced its trade deficit widened in February instead of narrowing to between $ 11.2 billion and $ 11.8 billion, as the markets had expected. `` The figures were plainly bad, suggesting there's been no real recovery in the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- trade situation at all,'' one dealer said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Pearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a British conglomerate that publishes the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday it has modified the terms of its offer for the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> financial daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Les </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Echos </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>, which also has interests in banking, fine china and oil, modified the 88 million pound, or $ 165 million, offer in an effort to overcome apparent <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> government objections to the takeover. Under the new offer, <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Echoso </PERSON> will continue to have a substantial French-controlled minority shareholding for another year. In addition, the new offer includes pledges that certain minority stakes in <LOCATION> Pearson </LOCATION> will remain under French control. The French government said in February the <ORGANIZATION> Les </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Echos </ORGANIZATION> takeover would require its approval, potentially a lengthy process, despite <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>'s status as a <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> company. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> analysts said the purchase of a newspaper by a non-French company was a sensitive issue before the French presidential elections. <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> now hopes the French government will approve the purchase before the April 24 elections, said a <ORGANIZATION> Pearson </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, who was not identified in accordance with British practice. The French government never spelled out its precise reasons for opposing the deal, but <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> said it was apparently concerned about publisher <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s 20.4 percent stake in <LOCATION> Pearson </LOCATION>. If <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> were to succeed in a takeover bid for <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>, control of <ORGANIZATION> Les </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Echos </ORGANIZATION> would pass outside the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION>. The new proposals call for <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> to acquire two-thirds of the equity of <ORGANIZATION> Les </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Echos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> immediately and the remaining one-third a year later, provided that <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> is still an <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> company. The original accord with <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Echos </PERSON> called for an outright purchase of all the company's stock in exchange for the <ORGANIZATION> Pearson </ORGANIZATION> shares and cash. The final purchase price remains the same, but will now be made in two installents. The original purchase accord also involved the transfer of 7.4 million Pearson shares, or 3.6 percent, to <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Beytout </PERSON>, who owns <ORGANIZATION> Les </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Echos </ORGANIZATION>, plus 355 million French francs, the equivalent of $ 63 million, in cash. Under the new proposals, Ms. <PERSON> Beytout </PERSON> has guaranteed to give the French bank <ORGANIZATION> Lazard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freres </ORGANIZATION> and Cie. the right of first refusal if she decides to sell her <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> shares. <ORGANIZATION> Lazard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freres </ORGANIZATION>, which has a separate 9.4 percent stake in <LOCATION> Pearson </LOCATION> via its subsidiary Financiere and <PERSON> Industrielle </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaz </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Eaux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>, has pledged it also will remain a long-term holder of its <ORGANIZATION> Pearson </ORGANIZATION> shares. The pledges are designed as a conciliatory move to reassure the French government that the Beytout and <PERSON> Lazard </PERSON> stake in <LOCATION> Pearson </LOCATION> will not be sold to <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> spokesman said.

<HEAD>Bank Settles With Three Utilities In WPPSS Suit</HEAD>

 Three utility districts have reached a $ 20 million settlement with bondholders who were left holding $ 2.25 billion in debt after the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> defaulted on bonds for two abandoned nuclear power plants. The settlement was announced Thursday by <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, a court-appointed special master overseeing negotiations to settle a huge lawsuit in the case. The securities-fraud suit is tentatively set to go to trial in September in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>. The settlement, still subject to final drafting as well as formal approval by the court and utility district officials, involves the <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Chelan </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> counties public utility districts, <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said. It comes two days after the city of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> announced it had settled its part in the lawsuit for $ 50 million. City attorneys said that was much less expensive than fighting the case and taking the risk of being held responsible for all or part of the potential $ 2.25 billion judgment. The latest settlement, worked out by attorneys for the utility districts and for <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which represents the bondholders' interests, brings the total of all settlements to $ 176 million The litigation continues against remaining defendants, who include the supply system, utilities that sponsored the plants and others, <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> noted. The bond default was the largest in the history of the municipal bond market. The power system abandoned the two plants six years ago following cost overruns and studies indicating the power from the plants was n't needed. The two abandoned plants, at the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear reservation in south-central <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and at <LOCATION> Satsop </LOCATION>, west of <LOCATION> Olympia </LOCATION>, were among five nuclear power plants <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> attempted to build during the 1970s. One is currently operating at <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION>. The remaining two, also at <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> and Satsop, were mothballed when partially complete because of financing problems and doubts about the need for the power they would produce.

 A pharmaceutical company said Thursday it has begun selling a new leukemia drug, the fourth new cancer agent since 1983 and the third leukemia drug in 10 years to gain federal approval.

<HEAD>Wider U.S. Trade Deficit Sends the Dollar into a Tailspin</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: An AM version expected by 5:30 p.m. EDT.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar ended sharply lower in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> Thursday after news that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit widened in February sent the currency into a tailspin that was only partially stemmed by coordinated central bank intervention. Gold prices rose. Dealers had expected the trade deficit to narrow in February and had built up long dollar positions _ or had bought dollars that they had n't yet agreed to sell _ which had to be quickly sold off. The dollar plummeted against most major currencies within minutes of the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announcement that the trade gap had widened to $ 13.8 billion in February from $ 12.4 billion in January. `` The trade figure caught everyone on the hop,'' said <PERSON> Marek </PERSON> <PERSON> Stefanowicz </PERSON>, a corporate adviser at <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Within minutes of the start of the dollar's fall, the central banks of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> intervened to buy dollars, dealers reported. Later, several of the central banks, notably the <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION>, confirmed their intervention. The interventions were not particularily large, dealers reported, but were effective because all the banks intervened at once. The intervention did not push the dollar any higher but was able to stem its decline. `` It is only the central banks keeping the dollar at these levels,'' said a trader at a British merchant bank. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it cost $ 1.8755 to buy one pound, more expensive than $ 1.8445 late Wednesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday's: 1.6635 West German marks, down from 1.6895; 1.3745 Swiss francs, down from 1.3983; 5.6390 French francs, down from 5.7295; 1.8680 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8950; 1,244.00 Italian lire, down from 1,252.50; and 1.2368 Canadian dollars, up from 1.23675. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar fell 0.30 yen to close at 126.15 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 123.60 yen. Gold rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 451.00 a troy ounce, compared with late Wednesday's $ 449.25. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold was higher, closing at a bid $ 450.50 compared with $ 449.50 late Wednesday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 1.34 to close at a bid $ 449.48. Silver bullion prices rose on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market where the metal was trading at a late bid price of $ 6.43 a troy ounce, compared with Wednesday's $ 6.41.

 Stock prices took a sharp drop today on the surprise news of an increase in the nation's trade deficit. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 52.56 points to 2,054.54 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Losers swamped gainers by nearly 8 to 1 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 182 up, 1,414 down and 313 unchanged. Before the market opened the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the nation's trade deficit widened to $ 13.83 billion in February from $ 12.44 billion the month before. That came as a big disappointment to market participants, who had been looking for a continued narrowing in the gap between imports and exports. The dollar dropped sharply in foreign exchange markets on the news, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> credit markets also took the news badly. Prices of long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds fell about $ 15 for each $ 1,000 in face value, putting their yields in the 8.85-8 .9 percent range Just a few weeks ago government bond yields got as low as about 8.3 percent. Stock-market analysts said persistent strength in imports, in particular, raised fears that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might soon feel the need to tighten credit to restrain the economy as well as to support the dollar. The decline in the Dow reached 50 points at midafternoon, activating for the second-time the `` collar'' set up by the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> in early February. At that point the exchange asked its member firms not to use its main computerized trading system for program trading. Among actively traded blue chips, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> dropped 1 | to 114 -LCB-; <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> 1 -LRB- to 44 -RRB-; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> 1 \ to 41 |; <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> 1 -RCB- to 45 -RRB-, and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> 1 The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks fell 3.49 to 149.71. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index was down 3.97 at 301.82.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Commerce Secretary <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Verity </PERSON> on Thursday voiced opposition to suggestions that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> should be allowed to join an international trade organization. But <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's opposition to Soviet participation in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- could change as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> moves toward a market-oriented economy. Some American businessmen supported admitting the Soviets to the group. <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> spoke at a news conference after signing a protocol endorsing joint Soviet-American business ventures. In September 1986, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> led the opposition to a Soviet effort to join <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, a 95-nation group that sets international trading rules. `` It would be inappropriate, perhaps impossible, to make any progress if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was a member of <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said. But he added that `` in time, as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> moves towards a market economy, that would be different.'' <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s `` perestroika,'' or restructuring program, is designed `` to move the Soviet economy toward a market economy, and that is important to the Soviet side and to all other nations of the world who would like to see movement in that direction. <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION>'s trip to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> comes in advance of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s five-day visit to the Soviet capital scheduled to begin May 29 Trade frequently comes up during summit talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who wants access to American technology and services to help improve his country's ailing economy. <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kachanov </PERSON>, Soviet first deputy minister of foreign economic relations, signed a protocol adding joint ventures to the types of cooperation encouraged by a 1974 trade agreement. <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION>'s three days of talks with <PERSON> Kachanov </PERSON> coincided with a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which attracted more than 400 American businessmen. Seven major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies said Wednesday they formed a consortium to work out business deals with the Soviets. Another company, <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, announced a joint venture on Monday to supply automated production controls for Soviet fertilizer factories. <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said he stressed to Soviet officials that improvements in trade depended on Soviet easing of emigration restrictions. He said the Soviets had agreed to `` marketing glasnost,'' using the Russian word for openness that characterizes <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s drive for freer expression.

 <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Decker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a leading producer of power tools and household appliances, reported Thursday its second quarter earnings more than doubled from the same period a year ago. <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> said it earned $ 21.1 million, or 36 cents per share, in the three-month period ending March 27, compared to earnings of $ 9.3 million, or 16 cents per share, in the same quarter a year earlier. Sales for the quarter rose to $ 537.8 million from $ 438.7 million, the company said. For the last six months, net earnings rose 65 percent to $ 52.3 million, or 89 cents per share, compared to $ 31.6 million, or 54 cents per share, in the first six months of the previous fiscal year.

 <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Thursday accused British investor <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON> of defying a federal judge by placing a newspaper ad promoting his $ 1.7 billion hostile takeover attempt `` You, our fellow shareholders, ought to ask: ` How long must we wait?''' for <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' management to accept the $ 60-per-share tender offer, the ad said.

The order bars the Beazer group from taking any actions to advance the takeover. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> said the ad also misrepresented <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>'s financial backing and misrepresented court testimony by company Chairman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pullin </PERSON> and board member <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Barber </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said that while the <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> group had not seen the complaint `` to the extent that it criticizes our ad, we believe it is entirely frivolous and without merit.'' <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' resistance to the hostile offer, launched March 3 at $ 45 per share and raised twice since, `` has deteriorated into one of history's sorriest examples of management self-entrenchment,'' said the full-page ad in Wednesday's Wall Street Journal.

 <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> appears to be taking <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>' takeover attempt more seriously since the Texas-based partnership increased its cash offer this week from $ 903 million to $ 1.63 billion, an analyst said Thursday <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> says it is now considering a number of options for remaining independent, possibly indicating a change in its attitude toward <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleinaitis </PERSON>, an analyst for the Chicago-based investment research firm <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. He said <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> had been resisting Desert Partners `` with a no-comment, no-action, let's - see-what-they-come-up-with sort `` But maybe <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> at this level is starting to look a little threatening to them,'' <PERSON> Kleinaitis </PERSON> said. `` Given Desert Partners' persistence in this deal, you'd think USG would have to do something.'' Desert Partners, controlled by oilmen <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, has maintained since it announced its initial offer in February that it is truly interested in acquiring the Chicago-based building-products producer. But skeptical analysts have speculated that <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s real intent was either to boost the value of <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>'s stock so they could sell their 9.8-percent stake in the company at a good profit or to bully <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>'s management into paying them off to drop the takeover bid On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> said it would pay $ 42 cash per share for up to 39 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding stock. Previously, <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> had been seeking to buy only 21.5 million shares at $ 42 a share. If Desert Partners were to obtain all the shares it is now seeking, it would own 85 percent of USG. USG has urged its stockholders not to tender their shares to <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, which said about 12.6 million shares had been tendered as of last Friday. USG's board met Monday to discuss <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>' latest move, then filed a statement with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> saying it was exploring options to remain independent. The options mentioned in the filing included selling part of USG to a third party for cash or assets, recapitalizing the company or repurchasing its own stock. Any of those actions would make it difficult for <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> to obtain the shares it is seeking. <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> Spar </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, said Thusday that the offer for more shares should leave no doubt about the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> group's intentions. `` There should be no doubt that <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> has been interested in acquiring USG for quite some time,'' he said. `` That commitment is underscored by the fact that they have now put up a substantial amount of money in commmitment fees for the financing and expenses related to the tender offer.''

 Stock prices nosedived today on the surprise news of an increase in the nation's trade deficit. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 82.22 points to 2,024.87 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street. Losers swamped gainers by more than 11 to 1 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 137 up, 1,577 down and 236 unchanged. Before the market opened the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the nation's trade deficit widened to $ 13.83 billion in February from $ 12.44 billion the month before. That came as a big disappointment to market participants, who had been looking for a continued narrowing in the gap between imports and exports. The dollar dropped sharply in foreign exchange markets on the news, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> credit markets also took the news badly. Prices of long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds fell about $ 15 for each $ 1,000 in face value, putting their yields in the 8.85-8 .9 percent range Just a few weeks ago government bond yields got as low as about 8.3 percent. Stock-market analysts said persistent strength in imports, in particular, raised fears that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might soon feel the need to tighten credit to restrain the economy as well as to support the dollar. The decline in the Dow reached 50 points at midafternoon, activating for the second-time the `` collar'' set up by the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> in early February. At that point the exchange asked its member firms not to use its main computerized trading system for program trading. Among actively traded blue chips, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> dropped 3 -RRB- to 112 -RCB-; <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> 1 ~ to 43 |; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> 1 ~ to 41; <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> 2 -RRB- to 44 -RCB-, and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> 1 -LRB- The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks fell 5.30 to 147.90.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> today approved a $ 1.1 trillion federal budget for fiscal 1989 after earlier deciding not to shift $ 50 million in spending from energy research to health care programs. The spending plan was passed on a 69-26 vote. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which passed its version of the budget earlier, must now agree on a compromise measure. Senators earlier had voted 57-38 against a proposal that would have transferred $ 50 million away from the superconducting super collider, a physics research program planned by the government and expected to cost about $ 4.4 billion ultimately. There still would have been $ 40 million in spending left next year for the massive project. The amendment would have used the money instead for childhood immunizations, community health centers, and to train nurses and other health care workers to take care of the elderly. `` It speaks to ... kids, old folks, poor people,'' Sen. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., the amendment's author, said of it `` Their lives today are as important as our other knowledge in the future.'' But opponents who spoke, most from the seven states competing for the super collider, argued that the project's scientific and economic benefits were too great to jeopardize. `` We can protect the health of our citizens without jeopardizing the economic health of our nation,'' said Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Tenn </LOCATION>., whose state is seeking the project <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passage put <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on track to completing its budget work unusually early in the year, largely because the summit agreement between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and congressional leaders solved most of the normally testy problems. But one of the questions the summit allegedly tamed _ how much money the government will spend on domestic programs _ reared its head Wednesday. That occurred when the lawmakers voted 93-0 to add $ 1.4 billion for drug programs such as law enforcement and prison construction, a measure legislators found difficult to oppose in an election year. The budget originally allowed $ 148.1 billion in domestic spending, the cap set in the summit pact. To get around that, the amendment's supporters said the drug spending would only occur if it could be paid for by better collection of taxes and debts owed the government. And they noted that the summit accord provided for additional spending in cases of a `` dire emergency.'' Asked if he believed the White House would accept the extra spending, Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who wrote the provision with Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., said, `` They're damned fools if they do n't recognize it's a dire emergency. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> had earlier approved another anti-drug measure by a 76-18 vote, adding $ 125 million for federal prisons and agents. The language, sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., provided the money by reducing federal travel spending The lawmakers began considering amendments after untangling themselves from arguments that began Monday, when they began debating the budget, over the spending plan's $ 136 billion deficit. Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the budget committee, argued that the real size of the deficit was cloaked because the huge surpluses of the Social Security system are included in the fiscal calculations Soon, lawmakers began trying to remove other special funds _ covering money set aside for transportation, banking and other programs _ from the deficit computations. Eventually, an amendment sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the budget panel, was approved that handed the problem to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which will suggest answers to budget problems next year. Other than the new domestic spending, the budget follows the summit pact's strictures. It contains no new taxes, since $ 14 billion in new levies called for by the summit have already been enacted. It also allows $ 294 billion for military spending and $ 16.1 billion for international assistance. The major differences between the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> budget and the spending plan <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposed in February are in domestic spending. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would spend more on energy, agriculture, housing and community development than the president, and less on natural resources, law enforcement and income security. Like the president, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would give vast boosts to spending for space and science, education, and aviation safety. The proposal's computed deficit of $ 136 billion meets precisely the deficit target set in the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law for fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1. The law is designed to eliminate the government's red ink by 1993. The House approved its version of the budget last month. The two chambers must approve identical spending blueprints, but the president's signature is not required. The budget is not binding. It is used as a guide by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as it passes legislation that actually provides money for federal programs.

 A federal judge said <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> can continue to seek proxies in support of a non-binding resolution asking that <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> negotiate with <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> over a takeover attempt. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> McKibben </PERSON> of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION> denied on Wednesday a preliminary injunction <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> sought against <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> regarding the solicitation of proxies. But <PERSON> McKibben </PERSON> ordered <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> to clarify a statement in the stockholder resolution the company will submit at Farmers' annual meeting May 20, according to a release issued Thursday by <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> said in a news release it was pleased with the ruling. `` Once again, we say to Farmers that there is no need for all this legal maneuvering,'' <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We are ready to sit down and negotiate all points in our offer, including a possible increase in price in a friendly transaction supported by the Farmers board.'' The resolution recommends that the Farmers' board reconsider its decision not to negotiate with <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> over the sale. The statement ordered rephrased said a vote in favor of the resolution would indicate shareholder support for the sale of Farmers to <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> McKibben </PERSON> said the statement needed to be clarified in order to conform to the literal wording of the resolution. <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION>, the Louisville-based subisdiary of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, has said it was willing to raise its $ 63-per-share bid, but refused on Wednesday to meet Farmers' ground rules for negotiations. Farmers, the nation's third-largest home and auto insurer and seventh-largest property and casualty insurer, insisted it would not sit down unless <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> agreed to keep certain information confidential. Farmers also asked <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> to reveal how much it was willing to pay for the company. <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION>, whose <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses include <PERSON> Kool </PERSON> and Viceroy cigarettes and retailers such as <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION>, responded by proposing alternate confidentiality provisions. Farmers, which is based in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, has about $ 11 billion in assets. <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 886 million on revenue of $ 5.8 billion in 1987.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday its first-quarter profit jumped 35.8 percent as its film and music divisions each turned in best-ever quarterly performances. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said its earnings rose to $ 89.1 million, or 56 cents per share, in the three months ended March 31 compared with a profit of $ 65.6 million, or 41 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 22 percent to $ 960.8 million for the quarter from $ 788.3 million in 1987. The company said its filmed entertainment division had an operating profit of $ 55.3 million, up 17 percent from a year ago and its highest profit for any quarter in the division's history. The results were helped by sharply higher results from <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>' international distribution of films such as <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON>'s `` Innerspace'' and <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Kubrick </PERSON>'s `` Full Metal Jacket.'' Strong domestic and international home video sales, pay television and television syndication revenue also contributed significantly, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said its recorded music and music publishing divisions had operating income of $ 70.5 million, up 50 percent from a year earlier and its highest quarterly performance ever. Million-selling releases by artists such as <ORGANIZATION> INXS </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Foreigner </PERSON> contributed to the record-setting performance, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION>'s results more than doubled to $ 15.5 million, but losses at <ORGANIZATION> BHC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the television station operation in which <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> has a 42.5 percent stake, left the cable and broadcasting division's earnings at $ 13.5 million, up from $ 5.3 million a year earlier.

 A late rally pushed grain and soybean futures to a mixed close Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, possibly marking the end of a recent sharp downturn in prices. Prices had fallen on Tuesday and Wednesday and continued lower on Thursday until shortly before the closing bell, when C & amp; D Commodities, the largest speculative trading firm on the floor, began buying contracts and sparked `` a spectacular closing rally,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` They were the catalyst for the break and they were the catalyst for the turnaround late in the session,'' <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> said. `` The market turned on a dime and ended up closing on a very firm note.''

 Assets of the nation's 419 money market mutual tumbled $ 2.02 billion in the latest week, the <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday.

 Stock prices and the dollar plunged and interest rates shot higher today after an unexpected bulge in the trade deficit sent shock waves through the financial markets. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped about 101 points, while in the currency markets the value of the dollar fell 2 percent against major currencies. Interest rates on a key long-term <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond jumped to a three-month high. Traders scrambled to sell dollars, bonds and stocks after the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported this morning that the nation's trade deficit had risen to $ 13.8 billion in February. That was the biggest shortfall since the record of $ 17.6 billion in October and the second monthly increase in a row. Many economists had been expecting the deficit to narrow. The Dow Jones industrials tumbled 35 points within 20 minutes of the opening bell on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> then stabilized for a few hours. But the slide resumed in the afternoon and the average skidded to a 101.46-point loss at 2,005.63, a 4.8 percent drop, according to a prelimary calculation. It was the worst decline since the Dow plunged 140.58 points on Jan. 8. The Dow's decline triggered a ban on the use of a form of computerized program trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the first time the `` collar'' has been triggered by a decline of 50 points or more in the Dow. Prices also fell on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index fell 1.3 percent, dropping 23.2 points to 1,787.2. Currency brokers reported the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and other central banks, concerned about a rout in the dollar, swooped into foreign exchange markets to buy dollars with Japanese yen, British pounds and West German marks to try to stabilize the currency's value. The dollar was down about 1.9 percent against the British pound, about 1.9 percent against the West German mark and about 2.2 percent against the Japanese yen at midafternoon. The impact also was felt in the bond market, an important barometer of the economy and interest rates. By late afternoon, prices of the key 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond were down 1 \ points, or about $ 12.50 for every $ 1,000 in face amount, and its yield, which moves inversely to price, surged to 8.855 percent, the highest in three months The bulge in the trade deficit suggested <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s trade problems remain more stubborn than earlier believed, leading some traders to believe that the dollar needs to fall further to make <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods more competitive in the global market. However, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>, chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Frequency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>, noted that the February deficit was smaller than the deficit of $ 14.4 billion in February 1987, indicating that trade flows are improving.

A seven-nation accord announced Wednesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had little effect on the currency market, <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said, because it merely reaffirmed a December agreement by finance officials of the countries to support the dollar The seven nations are the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>.

 Four major bank holding companies _ <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> _ reported sharp rises Thursday in their first quarter profits from a year ago. Analysts said the results generally were in line to slightly better than expected and showed that the banks' continuing efforts to trim expenses were paying off. Chemical, the nation's fourth-largest banking company, said net income for the first three months of this year rose 45.6 percent, to $ 125.5 million, or $ 1.95 a share, from $ 86.2 million, or $ 1.58 a share, a year ago. Manufacturers Hanover, ranked sixth, reported a 73.2 percent jump in its earnings, to $ 140.3 million, or $ 2.56 a share, from $ 81.0 million, or $ 1.68 a share, in first quarter 1987. Security Pacific, No. 7, netted $ 147.2 million, or $ 1.30 a share, compared with $ 116.5 million, or $ 1.06 a share. No. 26 <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, which is engaged in a hostile battle to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, reported net earnings of $ 54.4 million, or $ 1.47 a share. That was up 15 percent from $ 47.3 million, or $ 1.32 per share, a year earlier. `` Most banks have been pretty good restraining overhead costs. That has helped the results,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, a banking analyst with <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>. `` Fee income and trading activity is also very strong.'' Chemical said fees for trust and other banking services totaled $ 211.1 million, up 33.9 percent from the previous year. It said securities trading profits were $ 32.7 million in the quarter, up from $ 21.9 million last year. The company also said its provision for loan losses rose to $ 105.6 million from 87.2 million. Manufacturers Hanover said it lowered its loan-loss provision to $ 141.6 million from $ 152.5 million last year. The company also reported big increases in trading revenue and other fees. Revenue from all trading activities was $ 67.3 million, up 72.4 percent from $ 39.1 million in the first quarter. `` Strong core operating results were in line with what we had been projecting, and our financial plan to replenish common shareholders' equity is on track,'' Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGillicuddy </PERSON> stated. As part of that plan, <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> announced earlier this week it reached an agreement in principle to sell its consumer finance subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Security Pacific Chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flamson </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said his bank also was beginning to see positive results from its programs to control expense growth `` We expect to be implementing more new expense reduction plans ...'' he said. At <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, Chairman <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacot </PERSON> said strong performances by the company's core businesses contributed to the overall earnings growth. Core businesses at <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> are corporate banking, securities processing, retail banking and trust and investment management.

 The dollar plunged on foreign exchange markets Thursday after traders were shocked by an unexpected jump in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. `` The market was caught by surprise,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Sapiro </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Financial markets had expected the trade gap to shrink in February from its January level of $ 12.4 billion, so when the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced a $ 13.8 billion deficit Thursday morning, panic selling of dollars set in, <PERSON> Sapiro </PERSON> said. But gold prices benefited from the report. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid of $ 452.65 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT, up more than $ 6 from late Wednesday's $ 446.60. The central banks of several nations, including the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, bought dollars to help stabilize the currency, but the dollar still lost about 2 percent of its value against the West German mark, British pound and Japanese yen. `` They stemmed what would have been a momentary freefall,'' said <PERSON> Varick </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Switzerland </ORGANIZATION>, of the banks' intervention. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said the dollar fell 2 pfennigs against the mark immediately after the trade report, regained some ground and then fell again before closing near its lows for the day. The trade report came on the heels of an agreement among the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> industrial nations that reaffirmed a Dec. 22 pact to keep the dollar stable. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said that agreement contributed to the dollar's slide. `` The -LRB- dollar -RRB- rates on Dec. 22 were substantially lower -LRB- than they are now -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said, suggesting that the currency markets interpreted the ministers' agreement as supporting the dollar at lower levels. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> predicted traders would test the dollar at its lower levels to see if the central banks will again step in to support the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. If the dollar does not resume its fall Friday `` it will come back somewhat,'' <PERSON> Sapiro </PERSON> said. However, he did not expect any dramatic improvement. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it cost $ 1.8755 to buy one pound, more expensive than $ 1.8445 late Wednesday. In later <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading, sterling jumped to $ 1.8739 from $ 1.83755 late Wednesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday's prices, included: 1.66275 West German marks, down from 1.6950; 1.3720 Swiss francs, down from 1.4055; 5.6325 French francs, down from 5.74375; 1,233.00 Italian lire, down from 1,255.75; and 1.2365 Canadian dollars, down from 1.23775. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday's, rates, included: 1.6635 West German marks, down from 1.6895; 1.3745 Swiss francs, down from 1.3983; 5.6390 French francs, down from 5.7295; 1.8680 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8950; 1,244.00 Italian lire, down from 1,252.50; and 1.2368 Canadian dollars, up from 1.23675. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ended before the trade figures came out, the dollar fell 0.30 yen to close at 126.15 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 123.60 yen and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it fell to 123.725 yen from 126.44 late Wednesday. Gold bullion prices rose in response to the trade report, said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, vice president and bullion dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. On the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a troy ounce of gold climbed to $ 454 from $ 447 late Wednesday. The metal's gain was smaller in earlier <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trading. Gold closed there at a late bid price of $ 451.00 a troy ounce, compared with late Wednesday's $ 449.25. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold closed at a bid $ 450.50 compared with $ 449.50 late Wednesday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 1.34 to close at a bid $ 449.48. Silver was up on the Comex in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, closing at $ 6.450 a troy ounce, compared with late Wednesday's $ 6.325. In earlier <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trading, silver traded at a late bid price of $ 6.43 a troy ounce, compared with Wednesday's $ 6.41.

 Italian financier <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> failed Thursday to win shareholder support in his takeover battle for the massive holding company <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belgique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>. More than 12 hours after a special meeting began in a tent next to the company's headquarters, a final count showed <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> and his allies were unable to gain three seats on the company's board of directors The long-awaited tally, further delayed by computer problems, showed the <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> faction garnered only about 44.5 percent of the votes in a special election, short of the 51 percent necessary to win seats. But a slate of 12 candidates endorsed by <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> did win a majority, further bolstering the company's ability to remain a Belgian enterprise. More than 1,150 shareholders who control 75 percent of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s largest holding company attended the meeting, which began under tight security shortly after 10 a.m. local time <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>, who sparked the heated takeover battle for <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> three months ago, topped a list of 15 candidates seeking board seats. He hoped to be elected along with two allies, including <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Leysen </PERSON>, chairman of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Gevaert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NV </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> nominated the remaining candidates, most of whom were allied with <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Cie. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financiere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Groupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s largest insurer. The two companies have led the fight against <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>'s current 11 directors will remain, and the board will be expanded to include the 12 new members endorsed at the meeting. There is no maximum number of directors that can serve on the company's board. Among the new directors are six members of the <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> group and <ORGANIZATION> Groupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Lippens </PERSON>. The vote also was expected to serve as an indication of how many shares each faction controls. Under Belgian law, shareholders are not required to disclose the amount of their holdings, leaving only speculation as to which group is in the majority. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>, who spent some $ 1.7 billion to increase his <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> holdings, claims he and his allies control 48 percent of the company. But <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Groupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> have said they hold 50.7 percent, after spending about $ 850 million to beef up their stake. Yet even with a minority interest <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> can hamper the decision-making process. `` Without me ... no stable management of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> is possible,'' he asserted at the meeting, which he requested. An eleventh-hour attempt to reach an accord between the rival factions failed Wednesday night. <PERSON> Lippens </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Groupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> indicated <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> refused an offer to have a significant voice in a new management group. `` We deeply regret an important shareholder has refused to take a place at the table,'' he said Rather than be a team player, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> wants to run <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>'s day-to-day operations and vowed to continue to seek control of the giant company. `` Today's votes will not be for the long term,'' he said. `` In one week, one month, six months or one year, we will play a major role in <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>.'' Some officials at Thursday's special meeting concurred, saying they expect <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benedetti </ORGANIZATION> will win a board seat in the future. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>, who heads <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION>, wants to turn <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> into a pan-European holding company before 1992, when the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to remove regulatory curbs that hamper the free movement of goods and services. He said he launched his bid `` to anticipate'' a borderless <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Both <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> and his rivals seek to restructure <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>, which has interests in mining, engineering, manufacturing, chemicals, banking, financial services and other areas. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> is fighting a legal battle over <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>'s issuance of 12 million new shares in an attempt to dilute his stake The action was taken on Jan. 18, the same day <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> launched his hostile bid.

 One week before planned floor debate on sweeping trade legislation, lawmakers remain deeply split over whether to require public disclosure of foreign investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I think Americans should be allowed to know who is investing in this country,'' House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, told reporters Wednesday. `` I do n't see any justification for secrecy.'' But <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> hinted that within the week leaders might yield to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and other critics and bar the provision sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, from the 1,000-page trade bill. Actually, the <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> amendment is not even part of the bill. A panel attempting to draft a compromise between rival <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> versions of the trade measure was unable to reach agreement on foreign investment disclosure and simply left the issue hanging. The provisions in <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>'s amendment are complex. They would require foreigners and overseas-based companies to register with the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> if they owned 5 percent or more of an American company or real estate in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> if assets of the property were worth at least $ 5 million. Such an investor would be required to disclose his name, address, nationality, principal business, share in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment, date that it was acquired, the purchase price, location of the property, its name and the primary business in which it was involved. Some of this information already must be filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, but is not publicly available. It would be under <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>'s plan. Companies with a 25 percent share in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business or property with assets or annual sales of more than $ 20 million would have to disclose much of the detailed information required of corporations by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on its 10-K form. The items range from a list of directors and officers to a financial balance sheet. As soon as <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> introduced the measure, it caused an uproar. It flies in the face of business secrecy customs strictly observed for centuries throughout much of the world. Indeed, business disclosure laws are carefully drawn and limited within the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Critics of the amendment say it would immediately cut off the flow of capital to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from overseas and cause economic disaster. `` If we impede that flow, we will be slitting our own economic throats,'' declared Rep. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lent </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who has fought the amendment repeatedly as a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. One of the first victims would be such financial markets as the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> where foreigners are regular investors, Lent said. `` Buying in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Toyko </LOCATION> and other markets will flourish at the expense of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and our markets, which are envied throughout the world, will be impaired,'' he argued. He scoffed at the notion that foreign investment constitutes a danger and thus should be publicly spotlighted. `` If you wake up in the morning and say that foreign investment is evil, is dangerous, that is a kind of naive, xenophobic view,'' Lent said. British Ambassador <PERSON> Antony </PERSON> <PERSON> Acland </PERSON> said in a March 15 letter to Lent that the <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> amendment would affect some British companies that invest in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and `` put them at a real commercial disadvantage.'' `` It would discourage new investment from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Acland </PERSON> said in the letter, which Lent inserted in the March 29 Congressional Record. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> waves such objections aside, citing figures suggesting that foreign investment in farmland, factories, banks, businesses, buildings, government securities and elsewhere within the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy has shot up over the last seven years. `` Foreign money has been financing a record borrowing binge, while disguising the fact that we are living dangerously beyond our means,'' <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said. `` Floating on a feather bed of foreign financing, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has fallen from its status as the world's largest creditor nation in 1982 to become the largest debtor nation in history, with a foreign debt exceeding those of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> combined,'' he added. The administration sent out strong signals over the last few months that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would veto the trade bill if it contained <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>'s plan. That threat supplied powerful ammunition to the measure's critics on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., sought to break the deadlock at one point with a modification under which the need for disclosure would be studied and existing <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> information would be shown to lawmakers on a confidential basis Administration officials, however, sent back word that this proposal also would be likely to provoke a veto, and the idea was dropped. Not much information about foreign ownership of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> property exists in the public domain. However, studies have shown that citizens of other countries held title to less than one percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farmland. But the sheer volume of ownership is not the sole issue, <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> contends. He said it is important that <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> know exactly who owns what. `` Because of the lack of adequate reporting requirements,'' he said, `` we can not determine whether new foreign owners of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assets are legitimate businesses, hostile nations like <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, corrupt Third World dictators like the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Ferdinand </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> or organized drug traffickers laundering their ill-gotten gains.''

 The monthly <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit widened by more than 11 percent in February to $ 13.8 billion, the government said Thursday, sending both stock prices and the dollar on a nosedive. The Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 stocks plummeted 101 points or by about 5 percent and the value of the dollar against the Japanese yen and the German mark dropped about 2 percent on the foreign exchange markets. Only concerted intervention by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and central banks in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in buying up large volumes of dollars with yen, marks and British pounds prevented the dollar from falling further. Triggering the turmoil was the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report that the gap between the nation's imports and exports expanded by $ 1.4 billion from January's imbalance of $ 12.4 billion. It was the second straight monthly jump in the trade imbalance that had declined in November and December from a record $ 17.6 billion defict last October. `` We've stumbled here a little bit,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldinger </PERSON>, an analyst for Capital Insight, an economic consulting firm based in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` It reminds us that we have a major, major problem.'' Analysts had largely predicted beforehand that the February deficit would shrink slightly, the normal seasonal pattern for this time of year. `` For the second time in only seven years, there was huge, atypical increase in imports in February, showing that Americans have not lost their appetite for foreign goods,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, an economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It means we have not solved the budget and trade deficit problems,'' <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> said. `` And if policymakers and consumers do n't tighten their belts, the markets will, showing up in a tumbling dollar, spikes in interest rates and ultimately, in a recession, although not likely this year. Imports of foreign manufactured goods, oil and farm products increased by $ 2.6 billion in February to $ 37.4 billion. Leading the surge were imports of electrical equipment from abroad, up $ 323 million, and auto and truck parts, up $ 298 million. American exports also rose, but by a smaller $ 1.2 billion from January to $ 23.6 billion. For the first two months of 1988, the deficit is running at an annual rate of $ 157.6 billion, below the record $ 171.2 billion for all of last year but still worse than second highest imbalance of $ 156.2 billion in 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The nation's trade problems are severe and far from over,'' said <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s chief economist. `` While exports are up by $ 10 billion from a year ago, so are imports, leaving <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> no further along the path towards reducing the jobs-destroying deficit.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials downplayed the February numbers, instead focusing on longer trends that show a grudgingly slow improvement since last summer. The trade deficit over the last three months has averaged $ 12.8 billion compared with a monthly average of $ 15 billion the previous three months. `` Monthly trade figures are by their nature erratic,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. `` The figures seen this morning should be seen in context.'' With both exports and imports higher than they were in January, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said there is no reason for alarm. `` So the market goes down a little bit,'' he said. `` The same thing happened last fall, and there's a great frenzy for no reason. I certainly do n't see it as a reason to pass protectionist legislation, which is the undercurrent of the opposition's program. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil imports jumped 1.2 million barrels a day in February to 8.1 million, the highest they have been since September 1986. As a result, the trade deficit with members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> shot up by $ 270 million over January to $ 1.3 billion. The deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the country with the largest trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, also increased dramatically, by $ 500 million to more than $ 4.5 billion. But it narrowed slightly with the so-called newly industrialized countries _ <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> _ falling by about $ 20 million to $ 2.9 billion. Imports of manufactured goods from abroad increased by $ 2.3 billion in February and were $ 1.8 billion higher than the monthly average of $ 27.1 billion in 1987. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is not building its capital stock sufficiently to meet domestic demand,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasinowski </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>. `` The foreign sourcing during the period of the high dollar continues to represent a source of troubling import dependency.'' But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers also fared better in February, raising their exports by $ 1.2 billion to $ 16.1 billion, the third highest month on record after November and December of last year. Despite the increase in auto and truck parts shipped here from abroad, exports of Japanese autos themselves to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> declined by more than $ 120 million to $ 1.5 billion in February. Auto imports from other countries, however, rose by nearly $ 390 million. Agricultural exports _ chiefly big increases in animal feeds, cotton and soybeans _ rose by $ 280 million over January to $ 3.2 billion, the highest they have been since 1984.

 <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> filed suit Thursday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> seeking to block a hostile takeover bid by a New York-based partnership on the grounds the company withheld or falsified reports about its financial backing. The suit seeks a temporary injunction to prevent <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> or its subsidiaries from acquiring additional <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> stock or taking action to oust four <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> directors at an April 21 annual meeting. <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> claims <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> violated federal laws by issuing material to <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> shareholders which failed to properly cite all partners and investors affiliated with the takeover attempt. A <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> statement reports the suit stems from <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>'s April 11 admendment to an <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing which `` confirms for the first time that hidden partners and participants in the <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> effort against <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> include a complicated web or foreign and domestic corporations and partnerships. The suit names <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> principals <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gollust </PERSON> as defendants. Also named in the suit are: Swiss financier <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> <PERSON> Tettamanti </PERSON>; <ORGANIZATION> Oakley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> principals <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorp </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Heine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> alleges <PERSON> Heine </PERSON> and two <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> subsidiaries purchased <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> stock as part of <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>'s takeover attempt Neither firm was noted as part of <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>'s holdings in the April 11 filing, <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> alleges. New York-based <PERSON> Heine </PERSON> had acquired 2.35 million <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> shares as of Feb. 25, according to the suit. The <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> subsidiaries, <ORGANIZATION> Witherspoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> @ <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LP </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, own about 300,000 <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> shares. Two <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> limited partnership subsidiaries, RB Associates of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and Bahamas-based <ORGANIZATION> RB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, seek to solicit a majority of <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s 27,000 shareholders to elect the three <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> principals and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Strassler </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> board of directors at the annual meeting. Shareholders can vote in person or by proxy ballot. <PERSON> Strassler </PERSON> is also named as a defendant in the suit. The two <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> partnerships have accumulated 6.76 million <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> shares, or about 5.8 percent of the company's shares outstanding. <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> also seeks to have the shareholder proxy ballots not certified until the suit is settled. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> vowed <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> will fight the suit. `` The lawsuit is totally without merit,'' said <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>. `` It's clearly a last-ditch effort to win in the courts what they apparently are not winning among stockholders We intend to contest it.'' <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> said the suit should not postpone the annual meeting in <LOCATION> Andover </LOCATION>. In several letters sent to shareholders since March, <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> Chairman and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Colman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mockler </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> claims <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> plans to sell or dismember the Boston-based company. <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> stock fell $ 3.37 -LCB- to close at $ 41 Thursday in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading.

 A restriction on computerized stock trading that went into effect when the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled more than 50 points Thursday stemmed the slide only briefly and actually may have worsened it, brokers said. The widely followed barometer of 30 blue chip stocks dropped 101.46 to 2,005.63, its largest loss since falling 140.58 on Jan. 8. It marked the second time the so-called `` collar'' on index-arbitrage program trading was triggered since the restriction was announced in February as part of an effort to restore stability to a market still suffering after-effects of the October market disaster. It also was the first time the collar was triggered by a downward move in the Dow average. The collar was triggered for the first time ever on April 6, when the average rose 64.16 points. Under the collar rule, traders are banned from using the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s automated order system to execute index-arbitrage program trades for the rest of the day when the Dow average moves up or down 50 points from the previous close. The <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said the collar went into effect at about 1:55 p.m. Thursday when the average tumbled below the 50-point limit, battered by massive selling over disappointing news on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit, fears of higher interest rates and a weaker dollar. Although computerized program trading was halted, brokers who utilize the strategy began using an old-fashioned manual method for selling stocks and the Dow average kept falling. `` I guess there's really a lot of selling that's built up,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> DaPuzzo </PERSON>, manager of retail equities at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` You ca n't ignore the fact that there's heavy selling and profit-taking going on. Right now the selling is more chaotic because people want out at the same time.'' Others said the collar may have worsened the Dow average's drop because after the 50-point threshhold was reached, only sellers remained in the market. `` Once this thing goes below 50, nobody shows up to do any buying,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Barthel </PERSON>, a technical strategist at <ORGANIZATION> Butcher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Singer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. In index arbitrage program trading, brokers use computers to buy massive amounts of stocks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and the equivalent stock-index futures in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, or vice versa, in order to profit from price disparities. The technique has been mentioned in some studies of the stock crash as a possible contributor to the volatility and soaring volumes that pummeled the market and frightened millions of investors into selling.

 Travelers did n't rush to cancel flights on Eastern or <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> airlines Thursday in response to an unprecedented federal investigation, but travel industry people predicted business at both lines will suffer. In Eastern's home base of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, an employee of <ORGANIZATION> Barry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said no one had made travel changes through the agency. `` We have n't had anybody cancel. Eastern is very strong in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The majority of people take <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>,'' said the agent, who did not give her name. No changes were made through <ORGANIZATION> Dulaney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> either, agent <PERSON> Crystal </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> said. Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said the airline had not seen any drop in bookings. But <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chalen </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Four </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said she foresaw problems for the airline from the government's probe into the finances and safety of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. `` Some of my customers already do n't want to fly on Eastern anymore,'' she said. `` I am pretty sure that it is not going to get any better.'' Indeed, <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Engle </PERSON>, a traveler waiting to board an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> flight in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said: `` It concerns me a lot. I wish I knew this before it was 20 minutes before my flight.'' And in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> said she had several customers change future <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> flights to <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> because `` they're just really concerned that Eastern wo n't be around.'' `` I even changed my flight from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> this morning,'' she said. `` I'm concerned that maybe they are n't safe. I've heard so many bad things about Eastern.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday it would investigate whether <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and its management were `` fit, willing and able'' to carry commercial air traffic. The government has investigated small airlines and has revoked the operating licenses of some minor carriers, but analysts said this was the first inquiry involving major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s airlines together account for 20 percent of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air traffic. Continental is the country's fourth largest airline, while Eastern is the sixth largest. Financial analysts predicted that the federal inquiry, added to the company's financial and labor headaches, could drive more passengers away. `` That announcement alone is a potential problem to an airline or airline system that can ill afford the publicity, given its already well publicized problems _ from labor issues, to safety, to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s service record,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` They're not getting enough people on the planes because they have such a bad reputation, whether it's deserved or not. Add this issue and it's hard to quantify the effect on people's decisions. God knows what will happen if the government does indeed find they are unfit,'' he said. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> had record losses of $ 466 million last year and has an overall debt of around $ 5.4 billion. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> said recent disputes between <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> and the unions had contributed to a loss of confidence in Eastern and he predicted the investigation would do further damage. In a separate action on Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> announced a civil penalty of $ 823,000 against Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> because of `` recurring trends'' in connection with violations of safety regulations. The fine was imposed just over a year after <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay a $ 9.5 million penalty in connection with other safety violations. The latest fine is based on findings from an investigation in September and October, but Eastern now has an opportunity to challenge it. If the airline can produce evidence the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> considers valid, the fine could be reduced. Eastern ran full-page ads in newspapers Thursday, including the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, saying it welcomed the investigation because it will show the airline is operating safely and has been unfairly treated by federal authorities. `` We're confident the outcome will be a very good one,'' Eastern President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> said. In addition to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> also owns <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Britt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harbour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Provincetown-Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Unisys Net Income Up 35 Percent in First Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLUE BELL, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Computer manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported a 35 percent increase in net earnings for the first quarter, citing continued savings from the summer 1986 merger of <PERSON> Sperry </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Burroughs </LOCATION>. Net income was $ 149.3 million, or 72 cents per fully diluted common share, for the three months ended March 31. For the same period a year ago, <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> net income was $ 110.2 million, or 57 cents per fully diluted common share, adjusted for a July 1987 three-for-one stock split. Revenue fell 2.1 percent to $ 2.37 billion from $ 2.42 billion a year ago, when heavy end-of-the-year selling related to the old Sperry fiscal calendar raised revenues above typical first-quarter levels, the company reported. `` Our conservative business plan for 1988 and the cost advantages that continue to accrue to us from the merger put us in a strong position to achieve our plan in a modest business environment,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>, created in 1986 from <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 4.8 billion purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Sperry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, is the world's third-largest computer company after <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` We are pleased with results for the quarter as earnings exceeded expectations and our continued progress faster than planned augurs well for achieving our aggressive five-year growth goals,'' <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON> said. `` Business in the quarter was basically on target, with order and revenue trends similar to what we experienced in 1987, when international business was generally stronger than in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> operations continue to benefit from the fundamental structural changes made in 1986 and 1987,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> reports its earnings per share on a fully diluted basis _ that is, based on the number of shares that would exist if all stock options were exercised and all convertible preferred shares were converted into common stock. Earnings per primary common share were up to 77 cents from 57 cents a year earlier.

<HEAD>Precious Metals Futures Rally On Investor `Flight To Safety'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Precious metals futures rebounded in price Thursday, erasing the previous two days' steep losses as investors shocked by the widening trade deficit sought security in gold, silver and platinum. On other markets, stock-index and bond futures fell sharply in response to the trade figure; energy futures advanced for the fourth straight day; grains and soybeans were mixed, and livestock and meat futures were mostly higher. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report that the trade deficit widened by $ 1.4 billion in February to $ 13.8 billion prompted some investment fund managers to sell stocks and bonds and move that money into precious metals, which tend to hold their value in troubled times, analysts said. `` We're getting some investor flight out of stocks and bonds and into precious metals, sort of a flight to safety,'' said <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Savakl </PERSON>, metals analyst for <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Commodity Exchange, gold for June delivery moved back above the psychologically important level of $ 450 a troy ounce after settling at $ 449.60 on Wednesday. The trade figure was a bullish suprise for the metals markets, which had sold off in recent days on expectations of a reduction in the trade deficit to $ 11 billion or less, <PERSON> Savakl </PERSON> said. The weaker dollar and late-morning news reports of an explosion in downtown <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, lent further support to the markets. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is a rich source of gold and platinum, and heightened violence there could disrupt mining of the metals. On the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold settled $ 6.90 to $ 8.80 higher with the contract for delivery in June at $ 456.50 a troy ounce; silver was 12.5 cents to 14.1 cents higher with May at $ 6.47 a troy ounce. Platinum on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> was $ 17.60 to $ 18.30 higher with July at $ 540.40 a troy ounce. Financial futures markets registered disappointment in the trade figure. The contract for June delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 stock index fell 13.7 points to 258.40 on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>.

 Two brothers and a son who control the <PERSON> Carl </PERSON>'s Jr. hamburger chain were accused of using inside information to benefit their relatives in a $ 2.5 million civil lawsuit brought Thursday by federal regulators Sixteen people, all but one of them members the family that lends its name to <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON> <PERSON> Enterprises </PERSON>, were named in the insider-trading complaint filed Thursday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Founder <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON>, who appears in <PERSON> Carl </PERSON>'s Jr. television commercials harking back to his youth on an old-time family farm, would be liable for $ 1 million in damages under the formula used in the complaint. The complaint alleges that in October 1984, the insiders or their relatives sold stock and debentures to make profits or avoid losses when the price of shares in the publicly held company plummeted because of an adverse quarterly report. `` We have to show people in these situations you do n't tell your brother, your family, your relatives,'' said <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Einhorn </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> regional administrator, in announcing the filing. <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON>, chairman of the Anaheim-based company that has 450 outlets in the West, promised a vigorous defense. `` These charges are totally false,'' <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON> responded. `` My wife and I did not sell any of our stock, nor did we tell anyone else to do so. ... To suggest that any of us would intentionally violate the securities laws is highly offensive.'' <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON>, president and chief operating officer, are accused of passing information to their wives and children, but are n't accused of trading in the stock. The 12 other defendants, including the founder's son, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON>, a former vice president who now is a franchise holder, and <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> DeShano </PERSON>, who still is accounting director, are accused in the complaint of acting on the information. The rest of the defendants, none of them company employees, are children of the elder <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON> brothers and the childrens's spouses. <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON> stock closed at $ 15.50 per share Thursday in over-the-counter trading, down 87 -LCB- cents from Wednesday's close. Those named in the complaint made profits or avoided losses totaling $ 310,000, <PERSON> Einhorn </PERSON> said. The complaint seeks an injunction `` ordering them to disgorge profits derived and losses avoided.'' It also seeks triple damages from each of those accused of profiting. Against those accused of passing on information but not of making trades, it seeks damages of triple the amount of any profit allegedly made by those they tipped. That brings the total amount of penalties sought to $ 2.5 million. <PERSON> Einhorn </PERSON> attributed the losses to `` a downturn in profits after the Olympics,'' which brought hundreds of thousands of visitors to the city in the summer of 1984. He said alleged offenses were uncovered in random computer checks conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Einhorn </PERSON> said. Shortly thereafter, the company, which operates or franchises 450 outlets in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, launched an ambitious effort to expand nationwide. That effort was abandoned two years later because of losses, and the company returned to profitability in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Karcher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 16 million on sales of $ 369.5 million in 1987. The rest of the relatives accused of profiting from the inside information are <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON>; daughters, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcher-Garett </PERSON>, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> LeVecke </PERSON>, <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcher-Everly </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON>'s son-in-law, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fergus </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. Also <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Doneta </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomason </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> David </PERSON>; and Mrs. <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruns </PERSON>, and her husband, <PERSON> William </PERSON>

 The Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 100 points, the dollar sank and interest rates jumped Thursday after the government announced a $ 13.8 billion trade deficit in February, the biggest since last October. The Dow Jones average of 30 stocks skidded 101.46 points to 2,005.63, a 4.8 percent decline. It was the year's second worst drop after a 140.58-point slide on Jan. 8. The value of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stocks fell $ 99.7 billion, or 3.7 percent, <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said. The White House and most economists said the trade deficit was still improving in spite of the setback, but the markets took the news badly anyway. Most traders had convinced themselves the imbalance between imports and exports would be less than $ 12 billion, and they bailed out when the disappointing report hit at 8:30 a.m. EDT. `` There was a lot of wishing-makes-it-so -LRB- attitude -RRB-. People wanted to see a good number,'' said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>, chief economist of High Frequency Economics. He had predicted a $ 14 billion gap. The decline in the Dow triggered a ban on a form of computerized program trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. It was the first time the ban has been prompted by a decline of more than 50 points. Last week, it was triggered by an increase of more than 50 points. The Dow had climbed nearly 130 points from April 5 through Tuesday, largely on anticipation of favorable trade news. The news killed that rally as declining issues outnumbered advancing ones nearly 11 to 1 on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>. The trade deficit report also battered <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> markets, where the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-stock index fell 1.3 percent. The dollar lost roughly 2 percent of its value against the Japanese yen, British pound and West German mark in spite of heavy intervention by virtually all the major central banks. Big trade deficits tend to push the dollar down by giving trading partners an oversupply of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. The selling pressure on the dollar challenged an agreement to support the currency that was reaffirmed Wednesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by finance officials of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. The Group of Seven nations failed to freeze the dollar but they did `` let the market know they're there,'' said <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, a currency analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Interest rates leaped as pessimism swamped the bond market. The trade deficit signaled to some investors that an overly strong domestic economy was sucking in too many imports. Traders also feared a weak dollar could push up import prices, causing inflation and hurting fixed-income securities. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond recovered about halfway late in the day as stocks were sinking, but still finished with a decline of roughly $ 11 for every $ 1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves inversely to the price, rose to roughly 8.87 percent, a three-month high. The bond market's dismal performance was surprising because inflation signs did not crop up in the commodities markets, said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Worseck </PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. The trade deficit was the highest since the record gap of $ 17.6 billion in October. It was up from January's $ 12.4 billion gap. But <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON> noted it was down from a deficit of $ 14.4 billion the previous February. `` It's just one of those glitches that keep the financial markets interesting. The trend is still for improvement in the trade deficit,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Solloway </PERSON>, director of economic research at <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Solloway </PERSON> said traders had become the victims of expecting too much and then not getting it. `` We just ca n't too far ahead of ourselves. We all would like to see faster improvement, but it may be expecting too much,'' he said. For the first two months of 1988, the deficit is running at an annual rate of $ 157.6 billion, below the record $ 171.2 billion of last year but still worse than second highest imbalance of $ 156.2 billion in 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. Exports rose to $ 23.6 billion, up 5.5 percent from $ 22.3 billion in January and up 22 percent from $ 19.4 billion in February 1987. Imports rose to $ 37.4 billion, up 7.5 percent from $ 34.8 billion in January and up 10.9 percent from $ 33.7 billion in February 1987. The deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the country with the largest trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, also increased dramatically, by $ 500 million to more than $ 4.5 billion. But it narrowed slightly with the so-called newly industrialized countries _ <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> _ falling by about $ 20 million to $ 2.9 billion. Commerce Secretary <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Verity </PERSON>, who is in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, said in a statement released by his office that the February figures were disappointing despite what he called an `` underlying favorable trend.'' `` The figures show a substantial improvement from the average $ 15 billion deficit per month during the second half of 1987,'' <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We look forward to continued export-led growth.'' In another report Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said business inventories grew 0.1 percent in February, a small rise after four big monthly increases. A healthy rise in sales kept inventories from rising. Economists had feared the inventory buildup would force production cutbacks and slow economic growth early in 1988. But the inventory numbers, along with the trade report showing a big increase in imports, provide evidence that domestic demand has not weakened.

 A restriction on computerized stock trading that went into effect when the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled more than 50 points Thursday stemmed the slide only briefly and actually may have worsened it, brokers said. The widely followed barometer of 30 blue chip stocks dropped 101.46 to 2,005.64, its largest loss since falling 140.58 on Jan. 8. It marked the second time the so-called `` collar'' on index-arbitrage program trading was triggered since the restriction was announced in February as part of an effort to restore stability to a market still suffering after-effects of the October market disaster. It also was the first time the collar was triggered by a downward move in the Dow average. The collar was triggered for the first time ever on April 6, when the average rose 64.16 points. Under the collar rule, traders are banned from using the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s automated order system to execute index-arbitrage program trades for the rest of the day when the Dow average moves up or down 50 points from the previous close. The <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said the collar went into effect at about 1:55 p.m. Thursday when the average tumbled below the 50-point limit, battered by massive selling over disappointing news on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit, fears of higher interest rates and a weaker dollar. Although computerized program trading was halted, brokers who utilize the strategy began using an old-fashioned manual method for selling stocks and the Dow average kept falling. `` I guess there's really a lot of selling that's built up,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> DaPuzzo </PERSON>, manager of retail equities at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` You ca n't ignore the fact that there's heavy selling and profit-taking going on. Right now the selling is more chaotic because people want out at the same time.'' Others said the collar may have worsened the Dow average's drop because after the 50-point threshhold was reached, only sellers remained in the market. `` Once this thing goes below 50, nobody shows up to do any buying,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Barthel </PERSON>, a technical strategist at <ORGANIZATION> Butcher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Singer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. In index arbitrage program trading, brokers use computers to buy massive amounts of stocks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and the equivalent stock-index futures in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, or vice versa, in order to profit from price disparities. The technique has been mentioned in some studies of the stock crash as a possible contributor to the volatility and soaring volumes that pummeled the market and frightened millions of investors into selling.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Fall On Trade Deficit Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices finished broadly lower Thursday, dropping sharply on news of an unexpected widening in the nation's trade deficit but recovering some lost ground later in the day as stock prices plunged Long-term yields moved higher, but some short-term interest rates fell as investors worried by the steep stock market decline sought the relative safety of <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s 30-year bond ended the day down a full point, or $ 10 for every $ 1,000 in face value. The issue, viewed as a bellwether for the credit markets, careened 2 points lower shortly after the trade report was released. The 30-year bond's yield rose to 8.86 percent from 8.73 percent late Wednesday. But some short-term rates fell. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills, for instance, slid to 5.72 percent from 5.83 percent late Wednesday. Bond prices skidded immediately after the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported the nation's trade deficit widened to $ 13.8 billion in February, its biggest shortfall since October. Most analysts expected the gap to narrow. A wider deficit suggests that the dollar may have to fall further to reduce the trade gap. A falling dollar makes dollar-denominated securities less attractive to foreign investors, who have been major buyers of <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds. `` The bond market was in a state of shock when the number printed,'' said <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, research director for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. But later in the day, bond prices retraced some lost ground as stock prices fell. <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> said as the stock market's decline deepened, some traders decided to buy bonds where yields were becoming more attractive compared with stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average wound up down 101.46 points. <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> said yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills fell because demand surged for the government-backed instruments, which are viewed as secure and can be easily converted into cash. The phenomenon, known as a `` flight to quality,'' often occurs in times of financial uncertainty. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term issues fell \ point, intermediates slipped by between \ point and -LCB- point and 20-year governments dropped 1 -RRB- points, according to the financial information service <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Index </ORGANIZATION>, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, fell 0.46 to 111.30. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> composite index, which makes a similar measurement, fell 6.21 to 1,162.82. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, slid 2.52 to to 279.88. Yields on six-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills fell 2 basis points to 6.02 percent, but one-year bills rose 4 basis points to 6.46 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted at 611-16 percent, up from 6 | percent late Wednesday In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyers Municipal Bond Index that measures prices on 40 long-term bonds fell 25-32 point to 87 29-32 while its yield rose to 8.17 percent from 8.09 percent.

 Unexpected news of an increase in the nation's trade deficit touched off a freefall slide in the stock market Thursday, leaving the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average with its second three-digit loss this year Dow Jones's average of 30 blue chips plunged 101.46 to 2,005.64, for its largest loss since it fell 140.58 on Jan. 8 and its fifth biggest point drop ever. Declining issues overpowered advances by about 11 to 1 in the overall tally on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 144 up, 1,601 down and 248 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume came to 211.81 million shares, against 185.12 million in the previous session. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index fell 6.06 to 147.14. Before the market opened the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the nation's trade deficit widened to $ 13.83 billion in February from $ 12.44 billion the month before. That came as a shock to market participants, who had been looking for a continued narrowing in the gap between imports and exports. The dollar dropped sharply in foreign exchange markets on the news, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> credit markets also took the news badly. Prices of long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds fell more than $ 10 for each $ 1,000 in face value, putting their yields in the 8.85-8 .9 percent range Just a few weeks ago government bond yields got as low as about 8.3 percent. Stock-market analysts said persistent strength in imports, in particular, raised fears that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might soon feel the need to tighten credit to restrain the economy as well as to support the dollar. `` You got a nasty bit of news,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. `` The market is saying that the economy is too strong.'' The decline in the Dow reached 50 points at midafternoon, activating for the second-time the `` collar'' set up by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in early February. At that point the exchange asked its member firms not to use its main computerized trading system for program trading. But prices kept falling. Analysts noted that the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> had climbed nearly 130 points from April 5 through Tuesday, largely on anticipation of favorable trade news. This morning's report, they said, effectively wiped out the basis for that rally. Multipoint losers among the blue chips included <ORGANIZATION> Merck </ORGANIZATION>, down 7 | at 159 |; <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION>, down 4 -RCB- at 111 -RRB-; <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>, down 2 \ at 37 -RCB-; <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>, down 4 ~ at 77 ~, and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, down <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION>, which reported approximately flat first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, lost 5 \ to 103 -LRB- One of the few issues that bucked the downtrend was Resorts International class A shares, up 3 -LRB- at 31 -RRB- in American Stock Exchange trading. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> and <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, who have been battling for control of the company, reached an agreement that would ultimately give holders other than <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> $ 36 a share. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market lost $ 99.69 billion, or 3.70 percent, in value. Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 247.33 million shares. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's index of 400 industrials fell 14.17 to 302.34, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was down 11.82 at 259.75.

<HEAD>PR Execs Say Speakes' Phony Reagan Quotes Damage the Business</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Public relations professionals are concerned that former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> may have damaged the credibility of their business by admitting he concocted quotes for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` You never make up a quote for anybody,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON>, president of a large New York-based firm that bears his name. `` If one of my account executives did something like this, I'd really chew him or her out.'' Other public relations executives queried by telephone Wednesday agreed with <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON>'s assessment of <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>' quote concoctions, which were disclosed in a book <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> wrote about his tenure at the White House. However, none was willing to say <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> should quit his position as head of communications at the Wall Street investment giant <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. A few said they expected the entire episode to fade quickly from public interest Some sources, speaking on the condition they not be identified, suggested it was possible <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> could face sanctions by the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> for violation of its code of ethics. Article 7 of the code states: `` A member shall not intentionally communicate false or misleading information and is obligated to use care to avoid communication of false or misleading information.'' But <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> did not become a society member until November, well after his departure from the White House. The society's national secretary, <PERSON> Isobel </PERSON> <PERSON> Parke </PERSON>, said the group's attorneys believed the code covers the actions of members only while they are members. `` It is written in the present tense. It does not refer to actions that members may or may not have done before they joined,'' she said. Ethics-code violators face penalties ranging from warnings to expulsion from the 13,000-member society. Ms. <PERSON> Parke </PERSON> would not comment specifically on <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>' disclosures or speculate on whether his credibility had been damaged. But she said that `` if any individual deliberately fabricates quotations it will indeed damage his trustworthiness, particularly with the press.'' Asked if his disclosures have damaged the public relations industry, she said: `` It does n't help. Of course it does n't help.'' <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said there was no change in <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>' status at the company, and <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> rejected a suggestion that <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>'s own credibility may have been hurt. `` The events portrayed in the book had nothing to do with <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> said Tuesday that he had told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> about the quotes and the president never objected. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Wednesday he was not aware until recent days that <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> had attributed statements to him he did n't make. `` In the 34 years I've represented controversial and prominent people, I've never taken it upon myself to make up a quote,'' <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON> said. `` I think that goes well beyond reason and creates a false impression that public relations people are manipulative and ca n't be trusted.'' <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> was criticized by many other public relations executives, from the biggest international firms to the one-office operations. `` The bottom line is credibility,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> D-A-Y </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ogilvy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Mather, one of the world's largest public relations concerns. `` The role of the PR person is to communicate, to advance a person's point of view responsibly ... The president's cause was not advanced.'' <PERSON> Vivian </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> VM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a small <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-based </LOCATION> public relations agency, said: `` I think when you say somebody said something, they should have said it.'' Nevertheless, a few said they could understand how <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> may have likened the concocted quotes to the job of a speechwriter who is sensitive to a client's time pressure and intimately familiar with how a client thinks. `` If he was making up quotes that in effect made up public policy, I'd be a lot more concerned,'' said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> DiRico </PERSON>, chief operating officer of <PERSON> Fleishman </PERSON> and <PERSON> DiRico </PERSON> Public Relations in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` But I think in a lot of cases, whether it's a business executive or public official, they employ a PR person to act as official spokesperson,'' he said. `` They assume the PR person would have the good sense to know where the boundaries are. If you step over the boundaries, you get fired.''

<TEXT>
 The Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 100 points, the dollar sank and interest rates jumped Thursday after the government announced a $ 13.8 billion trade deficit in February, the biggest since last October. The Dow Jones average of 30 stocks skidded 101.46 points to 2,005.64, a 4.8 percent decline. It was the year's second worst drop after a 140.58-point slide on Jan. 8. The value of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stocks fell $ 99.7 billion, or 3.7 percent, <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said. The White House and most economists said the trade deficit was still improving in spite of the setback, but the markets took the news badly anyway. Most traders had convinced themselves the imbalance between imports and exports would be less than $ 12 billion, and they bailed out when the disappointing report hit at 8:30 a.m. EDT. `` There was a lot of wishing-makes-it-so -LRB- attitude -RRB-. People wanted to see a good number,'' said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>, chief economist of High Frequency Economics. He had predicted a $ 14 billion gap. The decline in the Dow triggered a ban on a form of computerized program trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. It was the first time the ban has been prompted by a decline of more than 50 points. Last week, it was triggered by an increase of more than 50 points. The Dow had climbed nearly 130 points from April 5 through Tuesday, largely on anticipation of favorable trade news. The news killed that rally as declining issues outnumbered advancing ones nearly 11 to 1 on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>. The trade deficit report also battered <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> markets, where the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-stock index fell 1.3 percent. The dollar lost roughly 2 percent of its value against the Japanese yen, British pound and West German mark in spite of heavy intervention by virtually all the major central banks. Big trade deficits tend to push the dollar down by giving trading partners an oversupply of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. The selling pressure on the dollar challenged an agreement to support the currency that was reaffirmed Wednesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by finance officials of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. The Group of Seven nations failed to freeze the dollar but they did `` let the market know they're there,'' said <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, a currency analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Interest rates leaped as pessimism swamped the bond market. The trade deficit signaled to some investors that an overly strong domestic economy was sucking in too many imports. Traders also feared a weak dollar could push up import prices, causing inflation and hurting fixed-income securities. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond recovered about halfway late in the day as stocks were sinking, but still finished with a decline of roughly $ 11 for every $ 1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves inversely to the price, rose to roughly 8.87 percent, a three-month high. The bond market's dismal performance was surprising because inflation signs did not crop up in the commodities markets, said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Worseck </PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. The trade deficit was the highest since the record gap of $ 17.6 billion in October. It was up from January's $ 12.4 billion gap. But <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON> noted it was down from a deficit of $ 14.4 billion the previous February. `` It's just one of those glitches that keep the financial markets interesting. The trend is still for improvement in the trade deficit,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Solloway </PERSON>, director of economic research at <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Solloway </PERSON> said traders had become the victims of expecting too much and then not getting it. `` We just ca n't too far ahead of ourselves. We all would like to see faster improvement, but it may be expecting too much,'' he said. For the first two months of 1988, the deficit is running at an annual rate of $ 157.6 billion, below the record $ 171.2 billion of last year but still worse than second highest imbalance of $ 156.2 billion in 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. Exports rose to $ 23.6 billion, up 5.5 percent from $ 22.3 billion in January and up 22 percent from $ 19.4 billion in February 1987. Imports rose to $ 37.4 billion, up 7.5 percent from $ 34.8 billion in January and up 10.9 percent from $ 33.7 billion in February 1987. The deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the country with the largest trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, also increased dramatically, by $ 500 million to more than $ 4.5 billion. But it narrowed slightly with the so-called newly industrialized countries _ <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> _ falling by about $ 20 million to $ 2.9 billion. Commerce Secretary <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Verity </PERSON>, who is in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, said in a statement released by his office that the February figures were disappointing despite what he called an `` underlying favorable trend.'' `` The figures show a substantial improvement from the average $ 15 billion deficit per month during the second half of 1987,'' <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We look forward to continued export-led growth.'' In another report Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said business inventories grew 0.1 percent in February, a small rise after four big monthly increases. A healthy rise in sales kept inventories from rising. Economists had feared the inventory buildup would force production cutbacks and slow economic growth early in 1988. But the inventory numbers, along with the trade report showing a big increase in imports, provide evidence that domestic demand has not weakened.

 Reeling from setbacks in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the courts, and at the cash register, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> faces new problems with federal government investigations under way. But the airline's president says he welcomes a major federal investigation into the management of its parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> as a way to highlight his company's performance. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> launched an unprecedented inquiry Wednesday into <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s finances and management, to determine whether the company is fit to carry commercial air traffic. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> also on Wednesday slapped Eastern with $ 823,000 in new fines for safety violations and said it was beginning an inspection of the carrier's entire fleet. Eastern President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> DOT </ORGANIZATION> probe `` certainly is n't going to help'' <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s financial troubles, which include the loss of $ 900 million over the past 10 years. Eastern also reported a nearly 20 percent drop in passenger revenue during March. `` The very idea of an investigation into safety is scary to the flying public, but we welcome it because we hope the whole story of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> dedication to safety and performance will finally be told,'' Bakes said. Bakes blamed the labor unions at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which was near bankruptcy when <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> acquired it in 1986, for political agitation that he said brought on the government's scrutiny of the company. `` We hope this -LRB- investigation -RRB- means an end to the behind-the-scenes lobbying and media manipulation by the unions and the end of the scare tactics,'' Bakes said. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, the leader of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was expressing its own concern over the management of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and would not have acted so decisively simply because of complaints from labor unions. `` What we have right now at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Air empire is dealmakers and lobbyists running the airline,'' said <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> 100, which represents 12,000 of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s 32,000 employees. Eastern pilots, flight attendants and mechanics contend <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> management has sacrificed safety and intimidated employees in order to cut costs at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, where Bakes wants to reduce labor costs by nearly 30 percent. Eastern's unions bitterly have opposed <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s plans for trimming costs and restructuring the airline, including the spinoff of its profitable Northeast corridor shuttle. On Wednesday, a new union lawsuit accused Eastern of violating a labor contract by using company planes to train non-union flight attendants to serve passengers in the event of a strike. The <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, Local 553, charged Eastern planes are being used by <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an independent cargo airline, to train non-union flight attendants. Eastern also faces troubles from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and federal authorities. In recent weeks, more than 150 congressmen have expressed support for a closer examination of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> management practices and held hearings over the issue. Federal judges last month blocked Eastern from spinning off its <LOCATION> Boston-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-Washington </LOCATION> shuttle into a <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary and also from using <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> planes to train Orion Air personnel. Eastern had lined up the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina-based </LOCATION> cargo carrier to fly its routes in case of an employee strike. The $ 823,000 civil penalty imposed Wednesday against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> comes 14 months after <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay $ 9.5 million in penalties because of earlier safety infractions. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials said the latest fine stems from record keeping and maintenance infractions similar to those found in the earlier action.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday approved a $ 1.1 trillion budget that calls for bypassing last fall's deficit-reduction pact with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to expand the war on drugs The fiscal 1989 spending blueprint, passed 69-26, also includes increases for education, the space program and AIDS research while freezing or cutting back transportation, housing and development grants to local governments. `` We made tough choices,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> He defended his plan while conceding that the deficit problem remains unsolved. `` We ca n't keep consuming more than we earn and living on credit,'' he said Sen. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, D-Neb., called the budget a `` lost opportunity'' that resulted from `` a decision to coast rather than deal with the deficit'' in an election year `` The next president and the next <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will be left with enormous problems,'' he said. The House approved a different version of the spending plan last month. The two chambers will begin negotiations next week toward a final budget resolution. Conforming with last fall's deficit-reduction agreement with the president, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plan earmarks $ 294 billion for military spending and $ 16.1 billion for international assistance. It includes no new taxes beyond the $ 14 billion enacted last December for fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1. The agreement also capped spending by domestic agencies. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> plan, like <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposed budget, conformed with those limits. But the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 93-0 Wednesday night to bypass the spending caps to provide an additional $ 2.6 billion for anti-drug efforts beginning next year. The money would go for treatment programs, law enforcement and interdiction of smuggled drugs. The amendment offered by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, called for increasing government tax and debt collections to cover the $ 1.4 billion portion of this new money that would be spent during the 1989 fiscal year Sponsors said they were n't busting the deficit agreement, because that pact includes a clause allowing exceptions for dire emergencies. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> budget claims to reduce the deficit to $ 136 billion, as required by the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law. Like the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> adopted the administration's optimistic economic scenarios in order to show less red ink. The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> estimates the deficit would be $ 35 billion higher. The deficit was $ 150 billion in fiscal 1987, and it is expected to dip to $ 147.5 billion this year. Overall, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> budget would cut the deficit $ 7.2 billion below what would otherwise be expected under current law, according to budget committee figures. Less than half of those savings would come from spending cuts, with the bulk relying mostly on sales of government assets to show a deficit reduction. The DeConcini-D'Amato drug amendment and a smaller one, also shifting more money to drugs, were the only two substantive amendments adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in four days of debate. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday rejected, 57-38, a proposal by Sen. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., to postpone starting construction of the superconducting super collider research project until after next year, and using the $ 50 million saved for health care Senators also defeated, 66-29, an amendment by Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, R-Colo., to cut development programs to pay for a reduction in the capital gains tax Like <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s budget, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plan greatly increases space and science spending. The space program would get a 27 percent increase and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> 11 percent more than during the current fiscal year. AIDS research would get more than $ 1.3 billion. `` This is one of the most futuristic budgets in the history of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the senior Republican on the budget committee. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plan also boosts aviation safety programs by 19 percent, to allow for hiring of more air traffic controllers and purchase of new equipment. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved a more modest boost in the space program, opting instead to protect housing, development and transportation programs from cutbacks. Neither plan contemplates major changes in agriculture programs. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version includes $ 500 million for buying commodities to continue the distributions to the needy. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> budget adopts <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposal to increase military pay by 4.3 percent but civilian federal salaries by only 2 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> opted for a 3 percent pay hike for all federal employees. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> budget action came on the earliest date in years, but <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was still missing its April 15 deadline for finishing budget action. The budget is a congressional resolution that does not require the president's signature. It serves as a guideline for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as it produces its annual spending bills.

 Here, at a glance, are some taxing developments on the eve of the income tax filing deadline:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TAX FREEDOM</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The `` average'' American will have to work 126 days this year _ two more than in 1987 _ just to pay federal, state and local taxes, the <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Tax Freedom Day'' will fall on May 5, the latest ever.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>GOP-TAXES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Some House Republicans used the tax-filing deadline to launch an offensive to block income-tax increases. The congressmen want: no tax rate increases or further cuts in deductions unless accompanied by rate reductions; a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution; and a `` taxpayer bill of rights'' that seeks to protect citizens dealing with the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TAX PENALTIES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> offered taxpayers tips on avoiding penalties for following erroneous advice given by is own information service. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> said it will consider the specifics of the telephone assistance call and whether the taxpayer tried to get the correct answer from tax forms, instructions or official publications. The agency indicated the taxpayer's case would be helped if he or she noted the name of the employee who gave the bad advice and the date and time of the call.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ROSTENKOWSKI-TAX MAIL</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Aides to Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, chairman of the tax-writing <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, say he has been flooded with more than 2,000 letters from angry, befuddled taxpayers lambasting tax changes. `` Simplification of the tax code must have been a joke. There is nothing that has been simplified,'' said one of the letters. The staff said most of the letters are part of a write-in campaign by Money magazine and contain copies of an article, `` Nine Tax Laws <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Should Repeal Tomorrow.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TAX NIGHT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 In many towns, post offices will send clerks to curbside to collect tax forms for last minute taxpayers. Local broadcasters and others have helped turn tax night into an `` event'' with promotions including coffee, doughnut, and aspirin giveaways. One radio station will offer taxpayers a chance to vent their feelings by taking a sledgehammer to a used car when they drop off their returns. A small charge for taking part will be used for charity.

 Sales of domestic cars and light trucks fell 10.8 percent in early April from a year ago, a drop that analysts labled a statistical blip and that some industry participants blamed on unique holiday and tax factors. Automakers reported Wednesday they sold 230,486 domestic-built cars and light trucks in the eight selling days of April 1-10, down from 290,826 domestic vehicles in the nine selling days of the same period a year earlier. Because of the difference in selling days, percentage changes for the period reflect changes in average daily sales, not straight totals. `` It's just the usual -LRB- market -RRB- volatility, nothing special. There's no question sales will pick up,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Glantz </PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Glantz </PERSON> and others said increased difficulty and confusion among people preparing this year's revised federal income tax forms may have kept more buyers than usual out of the market in early April as the April 15 filing date neared. <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, sales manager of <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyundai </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, said: `` The last two weeks have been slow. You see people waiting to finish their tax returns ... to see how much they can afford.'' The April 1-10 period also included Good Friday, Passover and Easter, a time when many people take extra days off work but are n't likely to wander into dealerships, analysts said Sales were unexpectedly strong during the first quarter of 1988, leading many analysts to increase their forecasts for the rest of the year. Early April marked the first real slowdown. `` It's the weakest period in a long time. -LRB- But -RRB- I think it's just a hiccup,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON>, industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` The pressure on dealers to move out excess inventory is lightening up. Inventories were on the low side of normal at the end of March,'' he said. Dealerships had a 58-day supply of domestic cars at the end of March, according to the weekly trade publication <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s Automotive Reports. A 60-day to 65-day supply is considered normal. Car sales dropped in early April for all domestic producers except <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, whose sales jumped 31.7 percent, and <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which began assembling cars in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> late last year. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the third-largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automaker, saw its car sales drop 7.8 percent from last year but saw its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market share rise to 15.6 percent from 14.3 percent a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> truck sales jumped 15.3 percent as its market share rose to 23.9 percent from 20.4 percent a year ago. Of the Big Three, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> suffered the largest drop in domestic car sales, 18.8 percent from a year ago, compared to a 15.9 percent drop for <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> held 49.2 percent of that market, down from 51.2 percent a year ago, while <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s share held steady at 29.7 percent <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s domestic light truck sales fell 12.7 percent and its share of the market shrank to 35.1 percent from 39.6 percent. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s truck sales rose 0.8 percent and its market share rose to 39.3 percent from 38.4 percent a year ago

 The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply rose in the week ended April 4, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure known as M2 rose $ 4.6 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 2,982.7 billion in the week ended April 4 from $ 2,978.1 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,751.7 billion from $ 3,745.4 billion. The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell $ 3.2 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 765 billion from a revised $ 768.2 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In judging its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures For the latest 13 weeks, M1 averaged $ 761.2 billion, a 4.3 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13 weeks.

 A suggestion that <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> may cut production and cooperate with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> to shore up oil prices raises serious antitrust questions and would not be in the country's best interests, oil analysts and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials said Thursday. `` You can imagine what the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration thinks about it,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official who spoke only on condition of anonymity. `` It's a cartel that does not operate in <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. interests.'' <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Elmets </PERSON>, press aide to Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>, said, `` It's the department's belief and the government's policy that assistance to <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> in its effort to manipulate the price of oil is not the correct approach.'' <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Hance </PERSON>, one of three members of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, met earlier this month with <PERSON> Rilwanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON>, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>, and discussed the possibility that his state and the cartel would cooperate. <PERSON> AP-Dow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> last week whether the cooperation might be in the nature of an information exchange or production cuts. He replied, `` Exchanging information is n't going to do the trick is it?'' <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Harte-Hanks </ORGANIZATION> newspapers Tuesday that he would attend the cartel's April 23 meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. `` I think that -LRB- cutting <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> production -RRB- is one of the things that has to be considered,'' he said. `` It would be one of the items we would discuss.'' Interviewed from <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> on Thursday, <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> said `` We have the right ... to set our production allowables. We can do it to prevent waste.'' `` We are not trying to seek an alliance or cartel. We just want input. ... our goal is one of stability,'' he said. <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> said he would n't make any deals without the approval of his colleagues and Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON>, who have told him to go ahead with the trip. Some industry analysts expressed doubts about the wisdom of such an action, while others questioned its legality. `` It is probably a violation of the antitrust laws,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamont </PERSON>, oil specialist in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> law firm of <ORGANIZATION> Lobel </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Novins </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lamont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Flug </PERSON>. However, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON>, who headed the antitrust division of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> early in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, said, `` It is fairly standard doctrine that the antitrust laws apply only to private activity,'' not action by a state. <PERSON> Hance </PERSON>'s efforts pose `` a very interesting question. The economic evil that results is precisely the evil that the antitrust laws are aimed against,'' <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> said in an interview from the <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, where he is a professor. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>, spokesman for the antitrust division, declined immediate comment. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer-Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, an advocacy group in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said it was `` a joke'' to think <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> can help <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> be any more effective in holding up prices than it has been in recent years. But, he said, `` It would be tantamount to criminal activity if anyone in the private sector did it.'' <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is the nation's No. 1 oil producer. Statistics for 1986, the most recent that break down production by state, show output of 2.3 million barrels from 201,000 wells _ a quarter of the nation's production and a third of its wells Since 1972, the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has set allowable production quotas at 100 percent of capacity. It was these quotas that had permitted <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to serve the role of `` swing producer'' in world oil markets before the rise of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> in the 1960s and 1970s. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> was hit hard by the oil price collapse of 1986 engineered by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s leading producer, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. The state lost 8,000 wells during that year. The average price at the well plunged from $ 26.80 per barrel in 1985 to $ 14.74 in 1986, cutting the aggregate wellhead value of the state's crude production from $ 24 billion to $ 12 billion. Prices have recovered from their lows of 1986, but never have approached the 1985 price. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s recent conversations with non-member nations, and the prospect of their cooperation, kicked up typical prices this week by about $ 1 a barrel to a bit more than $ 18 a barrel, which is <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark price. `` We ca n't bury our heads in the sand anymore and hope things get better,'' <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> said, adding that he would not take part in the formal <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> sessions but would `` meet with some of the <ORGANIZATION> OEPC </ORGANIZATION> ministers'' separately. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Safer </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consulting firm, said a likely cutback would be about 70,000 barrels a day _ an amount he said could be made up quickly by other sources. `` You could probably squeeze that much out of other -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- states,'' he said. `` The politics of the day may not be in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' interest. The federal government might not like it. In the consuming states, obviously, reaction would n't be favorable to getting in bed with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>,'' Safer added.
