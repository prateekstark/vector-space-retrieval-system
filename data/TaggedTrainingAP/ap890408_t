 The best way to prevent a resurgence of power by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> is to hold free elections and let the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> people reject the faction, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. But the department's statement did not rule out a role in an interim coalition government for the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, under whose former rule international human rights groups estimate one-fourth of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s 8 million people died from famine or execution. Fear of a return to power by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the strongest of three insurgent groups in a <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance coalition led by U.S.-backed Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, has been a major stumbling block to a negotiated settlement with the Vietnamese-installed government. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> is scheduled to meet with <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, the Vietnam-backed Cambodian leader, on May 2 in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> comments followed <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s announcement this week that it would pull its remaining troops out of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by the end of September, ending an 11-year occupation that ousted the communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> from power. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> totally opposes a return to dominance by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>,'' the statement said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> envisions an arrangement in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in which an interim coalition government is headed by <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, `` the logical leader of such an arrangement,'' the statement said. `` Whether the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, minus <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON> and the other discredited <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> leaders who clearly must be excluded, are permitted to participate in such an interim arrangement is something the Cambodian factions themselves will have to decide,'' the department said. `` We are convinced that in free and fair elections'' for a permanent government, `` the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> people would reject the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>,'' it said. Any future arrangements for a return to democracy in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> would also have to include `` effective guarantees'' to prevent power from falling into the hands of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the department said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say such safeguards would include an international force to monitor the Vietnamese pullout, a halt to outside supply of arms to the Cambodian factions and improved international access to the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> camps along the Thai-Cambodian border. International human rights groups and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have accused the faction of committing atrocities against prisoners taken to those camps. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> view has concerned some <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries who reject any role for the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, even an interim one, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say the group is a fact of life and has too much power in the resistance coalition to be ignored. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> announced this week that it would continue arming the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> until <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> makes good on its promise to pull out its troops, estimated to number 50,000 to 70,000. Meanwhile, Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, called Friday for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to send military aid to the forces backing <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> and one of his allies, Son <PERSON> Sann </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should do `` everything it can'' to support the resistance against the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, who just returned from discussions in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> on the situation in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. He proposed that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> establish an interim government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> to set up a political settlement through elections.

<HEAD>Attorney General Calls for DNA Analysis of Criminals for Crime Solving</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Criminals convicted of violent crimes would have their blood drawn for `` genetic fingerprinting'' to help solve future crimes, under legislation endorsed Friday by state Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON>. Analysis of the unique genetic blueprint can be a powerful tool for investigating and prosecuting violent crime, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> said Friday in support of legislation proposed by state Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is found in the chromosomes of cells, including saliva, hair, blood, semen, tissue and bone marrow. Only identical twins can have the same DNA pattern, or genetic blueprint. Under the bill, blood samples already required of sex criminals would be taken also from people convicted of murder, assault or battery. DNA analysis of the samples would be stored in a computerized data base available to police. The information could link a suspect to a crime in which tissue is left behind. Rape investigations, in particular, would benefit from the system, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> said. The state of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> will begin providing DNA testing for its police and sheriff's departments on May 1.

<TEXT>
 JUDGE <PERSON> GESELL </PERSON>: Well, now, colonel, that would require going to the president, would n't it? ... Did you understand you had the power to assert executive privilege for the president? NORTH: It was my understanding, sir, that executive privilege could be exerted. JUDGE <PERSON> GESELL </PERSON>: By the president? NORTH: Well, by the office of the presidency, yes, sir. -LRB- There followed an exchange describing concerns by <PERSON> North </PERSON> about the response to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> suggested by <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, including concern about the disclosure of clandestine ammunition shipments to the Contras. -RRB- NORTH: I was disturbed that the answer he was going to give, given what the press was saying, the media was out there reporting in volumes on what was going on down in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and all this was going to do was add, you know, fuel to the fire. It was like throwing gasoline on the fire. In fact, it ended up that way. ... My point was, this answer that you -LRB- <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> -RRB- are proposing is not going to help us. It is not going to help get the job done. It is not going to help get aid to the resistance. It is just going to make things worse. SULLIVAN: Did Mr. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> reject your advice then with respect to the draft that he had made? NORTH: Yes, sir, he did. JUDGE <PERSON> GESELL </PERSON>: What did he say, colonel? NORTH: My recollection is, sir, that he said that he had talked with the president about the approach we were taking on the letters and that my approach was far too confrontational. ... SULLIVAN: Congressman <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> received a response to his letter at about the same time, did n't he? NORTH: Yes, sir. ... SULLIVAN: Was ... Congressman <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>' letter ... similar to the <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> letter? NORTH: Yes, sir, it is. -LRB- North refers to several additional inquiries from <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> and that <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> briefed the congressman. -RRB- SULLIVAN: Now, after then, in order, two letters _ these letters had been sent by Mr. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, two to <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION>, one to <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>? NORTH: Right. SULLIVAN: He -LRB- <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> -RRB- had been up to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> twice? NORTH: Yes. ... There was a fairly steady flow of paper from Mr. <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> asking for documents, yes, sir. SULLIVAN: What are you telling Mr. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> that he should do with respect to <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>' further inquiry ...? NORTH: What I said was that I had attached a letter from Mr. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> back to Congressman <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> in response to his request for documents. ... -LRB- I -RRB- told Mr. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> to remind Mr. <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> that the classified letter he had sent earlier had been revealed to the media. <PERSON> SULLIVAN </PERSON>: ... Is this your draft that you recommended <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> send to <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>? -LRB- in response to the inquiries. -RRB- NORTH: Yes, sir, it is. SULLIVAN: Does your draft give <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> what he wants or what he is asking for? NORTH: No, sir, it does not. SULLIVAN: Does it take a hard line position saying, in essence, that the information should not be given? NORTH: Yes, sir, it takes the approach of executive privilege. ... SULLIVAN: In essence, you are telling him we are not going to give you documents? NORTH: We are not going to give you documents and here is why. -LRB- <PERSON> North </PERSON> says his draft letter was never sent. -RRB- <PERSON> SULLIVAN </PERSON>: So that you never did get your way in recommending that the executive branch simply say to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, we have a right not to provide information? NORTH: No, sir, I did n't. ... He -LRB- <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> -RRB- did call me over to his office and showed me this stack of documents, which I at that point did not realize was sitting over in his office. I know I was surprised that they were there but not shocked. I mean, they were his documents. SULLIVAN: Tell the jury what happened in that meeting with regard to these documents. NORTH: Mr. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> showed me the pile of documents and said, there are several in here that are _ my recollection of the word is problematical, that this handful, and he had pulled out several, are a problem and they are inconsistent with what we have said to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. And certainly they were. I think he handed them to me and I looked at them. And they were documents that clearly showed what I had been doing at his direction in Central America. ... And he said, these need to be fixed. In fact, he handed me a list that had those documents on it and, as I recall, also cited several others that I wrote down on the back of that list. He gave me that list and said, fix these documents so that they are consistent with what we have basically told the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. SULLIVAN: Did you explain to him right there at the time that it did n't make sense to change any documents because the files were filled with similar documents? NORTH: Yes, I did. <PERSON> SULLIVAN </PERSON>: What was his response to that? NORTH: He just told me to fix the documents and I mean, what's important, those were his documents I had written them all. But they were his documents. SULLIVAN: What happened to the request that he made to change documents? Did it just sit there? NORTH: Basically it did. ... SULLIVAN: So why did n't you do what he said? NORTH: Because I just did n't _ I did n't think it made any sense. -LRB- A year later when <PERSON> North </PERSON> was about to be dismissed, he said he altered the document. -RRB- SULLIVAN: That was in November 1986? NORTH: Yes, sir. SULLIVAN: Did you believe it was unlawful to do that? NORTH: No, I had written those documents. I had prepared them for him. They were his documents. It never occurred to me that that could be unlawful.

<HEAD>President Puts Government in Control of Alaskan Cleanup</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he wants `` complete restoration'' of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s oil-fouled Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> and is sending in federal troops and inviting an army of volunteers to help clean up the massive pollution. `` The job of cleaning up the oil from both the sea and the affected land areas will be massive, prolonged and frustrating,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Friday as he put the government in virtual control of the operation. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, tapped to mobilize and coordinate federal efforts, said `` the resources of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government have been put at my disposal'' to ensure that the area is returned to its pristine condition `` and I plan to use them.'' Administration sources, declining to be identified, said thousands of military personnel would be involved. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced his decision at a hurriedly called news conference where he doggedly refused to answer questions about his role in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's secret program to aid the Contra rebels. He said any comment could prejudice the trial of one-time White House aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, at which new details of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s role emerged Thursday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a questioner, `` The legal process ought to run unfettered, without you or me endangering the trial process.'' Turning to foreign policy, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the situation in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> was slightly improved because of a proposal by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to hold elections among Palestinian Arabs in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. `` In the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, a little step sometimes can be fruitful,'' he said. `` I think the climate is better than it has been.'' On other subjects, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: _ `` I have no intention of budging one inch'' on Democratic attempts to get him to raise his minimum-wage proposal above $ 4.25 an hour, coupled with a six-month subminimum `` training wage.'' The House has passed a bill to raise the minimum wage to $ 4.55. _ He will not be prodded by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to speed up a foreign policy review and return to strategic arms talks `` We're making a prudent review and I will be ready to discuss that with the Soviets when we are ready,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. _ Developments in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> were encouraging and represented a `` mind-boggling'' shift in the attitude of the communist government The <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> government this week approved a sweeping agreement for democratic changes and legalizing the once-banned Solidarity trade union. Opening the news conference, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> branded the 10-million gallon oil spill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> a `` tragic environmental disaster'' and said it had produced `` deadly results for wildlife and hardship for local citizens.'' He said, `` our ultimate goal must be the complete restoration of the ecology and the economy of Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, including all of its fish, marine mammals, birds and other wildlife.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> noted that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> had acknowledged responsibility and liability for the spill. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> `` should remain responsible for both damages and for employing civilian personnel necessary to control further damage. `` However, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts, standing alone, are not enough.'' He said the federal effort `` should not in any way relieve <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> from any of its responsibilities or liabilities.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the military would provide personnel and equipment for direct cleanup activities as well as logistical support. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said the military could beef up the <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> airport to a 24-hour-a-day operation and provide housing and food for cleanup personnel. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he hoped facilities would be ready by summer to accommodate a corps of volunteers. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said the volunteers might be mobilized later this spring to help clean up oil-fouled coastlines and wildlife on the dozens of islands affected by the spill. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> emphasized that `` we are not federalizing'' the cleanup. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> explained that the administration was not using the word `` federalization'' because of `` some legal connotations'' _ apparently dealing with liability for the spill and cleanup.

 A sex survey designed to help stem the spread of the deadly AIDS virus must be revised to ensure the government does not pry needlessly into the personal lives of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION>, Health Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> has ordered. Heeding the advice of budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> on Friday ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to conduct a `` thorough review and revision'' of the survey so that it is scientifically sound and `` sensitive and appropriate to the proper role of government.'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> had been pressured to act against the survey by a few conservative Republicans in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who have organized letter-writing and telephone campaigns expressing outrage at the survey proposal. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mero </PERSON>, a spokesman for Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dannemeyer </PERSON>, R-Calif., who has been rallying opposition to the survey, said, `` We hope Secretary <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> will take it -LRB- <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>'s concerns -RRB- to heart and put this thing out to pasture where it belongs. He said that when the revisions are completed, he will conduct `` a final, personal review.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said he recognizes the survey is needed to help health experts better understand Americans' sexual behavior so they can improve strategies to stem the sexually-transmitted AIDS virus. But the survey should `` gather only data which is essential to public health needs,'' he said. `` My initial review of the survey instrument does indicate to me potential problems with the tone and content of the questions,'' he said, noting it was prepared before he took over at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> in March. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> acted after receiving criticism from <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> in a letter Thursday in which he said: `` I have a great deal of difficulty understanding how many of the questions are related to essential public interests.'' The Office of Management and Budget, which <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> heads, must approve all government surveys as part of the Paperwork Reduction Act, but only for purposes of reducing burdensome federal paperwork. Citing that law, <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> told <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> in the letter that <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> officials do not `` have the authority at this point to stop the proposed study.'' The proposed project includes a pilot survey of 2,300 Americans to learn the intimate details of their sexual lives, including when they last had sex, what they did and whether their partner was a man or woman. Other questions asked about such things as masturbation, oral sex and anal sex. A subsequent survey, at an estimated cost of $ 15 million, would question 20,000 people. The department said the survey is intended to produce a comprehensive picture of Americans' sexual behavior to help health experts better plan strategies to fight the spread of the deadly AIDS virus and other sexually transmitted diseases. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said he recognized that need, `` but, as important as it is, that is a considerably narrower subject than the more general subject of sexual mores, preferences and behavior patterns in American society.'' `` While I in no way question the rights of private researchers to explore this subject, I do question the extent to which it may be appropriate for the public sector to subsidize such research,'' the budget chief said.

 Activists were thronging to the nation's capital today for a demonstration that organizers hope will cement public opinion once and for all in favor of a woman's right to an abortion March leaders say the demonstration on Sunday will launch a campaign that includes nationwide distribution of a videotape aimed at countering the anti-abortion movement's trademark video, `` Silent Scream.'' The 20-minute videotape `` Abortion: For Survival'' includes footage of a woman undergoing an abortion to show the procedure is `` safe and simple'' and the indiscernible remains taken from the uterus in a first-trimester abortion. The videotape `` puts it where it's at,'' said <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Smeal </PERSON>, president of the Fund for the Feminist Majority. `` It talks about abortion as a public health necessity and essential for the well-being of millions of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women. `` It features the central issue of this debate: What is abortion, why it's needed and why the public health and medical establishment of our society and worldwide is for keeping it legal.'' The tape is being distributed to government officials and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and state legislatures as well as on college campuses nationwide, she said. `` Silent Scream'' expresses the anti-abortion view by depicting a fetus being aborted. March organizers said other parts of their campaign include applying pressure on government agencies and pharmaceutical companies to improve available contraception and standing up to Operation Rescue's attempts to close down abortion clinics. The march is aimed at women's rights in general and a pending <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision that could reverse its 1973 landmark ruling, <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, which legalized abortion. Oral arguments in the new case are scheduled for April 26. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told anti-abortion activists a few days after he moved into the Oval Office that he wanted the decision overturned. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> faced White House reporters on Friday but was not asked about the march or his views on abortion at a news conference that covered issues ranging from the Iran-Contra affair to the minimum wage, the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil spill to foreign policy in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. March organizers said students were coming from about 500 college campuses, many of them in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, where many college students are within easy traveling distance of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Other delegations of students as well as activists representing churches, labor unions and other groups across the country are coming. Dozens of celebrities are also scheduled to appear. <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Yard </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>, said she expected the size of the demonstration will be `` easily double ... and probably -LRB- be -RRB- considerably'' larger than the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> march three years ago which drew a crowd police estimated at 90,000. A counterdemonstration by anti-abortion advocates is expected to draw about 300 people during Sunday's pro-choice march from the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Monument down the Mall to the Capitol.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration wants <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers to begin slicing chunks of money off a fiscal 1989 spending bill that has more than doubled in size in recent days. Figures gathered Friday showed that after a week of work by the subcommittees of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a measure proposed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for $ 2.2 billion in new spending this year has grown to $ 4.6 billion. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, sent a letter Thursday to Rep. <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Conte </PERSON>, R-Mass., ranking Republican on the appropriations panel, warning the lawmakers that because of the added expenditures, he would urge <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to veto the bill <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> noted that under a 1987 budget summit agreement between then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and congressional leaders, additional spending for this year could be allowed only in case of a `` dire emergency.'' `` In action taken this week, we believe several of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittees have adopted items that are a clear violation of the summit agreement,'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Conte </PERSON> said in an interview that he agreed that the extra spending should not be on the bill. `` They're not going to get anywhere with this,'' he said, referring to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats who are pushing the more generous version of the spending measure. The new spending appended by the lawmakers includes $ 726 million for anti-drug efforts, including money for prisons, police officers and prevention programs; $ 256 million to pay reparations to Japanese-Americans interned during World War II; and $ 350 million on top of a $ 250 million request by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to pay the costs of fighting last year's western forest fires. The subcommittees also ignored a 1.1 percent across-the-board slash that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had proposed in many domestic programs. That cut would have saved $ 829 million, but was attacked by critics for deriving one-third of its savings from programs for the poor. The deficit for fiscal 1989 _ which ends Sept. 30 _ was recently projected by <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> at $ 170.2 billion, excluding this bill. The budget resolution passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last spring called for a 1989 deficit of $ 142 billion. For technical reasons, the total for new spending in a bill frequently differs from the impact the measure will have on the government's red ink. Among other expenditures added to the bill by the subcommittees were $ 96 million for the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and other <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> law enforcement agencies plus $ 36 million for drug-testing and other anti-drug efforts by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. In addition, the lawmakers inserted $ 35 million for the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> to hire more security officers, safety inspectors and air traffic controllers; $ 35 million for the prosecution of savings and loan fraud cases; and $ 32 million for improvements in weather forecasting equipment and for other <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> expenses. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s bill had included $ 892 million for the guaranteed student loan program for college students; $ 850 million for cost-of-living increases in veterans' benefits and other Department of Veterans Affairs programs; $ 423 million for foster care and adoption programs; $ 100 million for the costs of increased immigration from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>; and $ 55 million for the government's uranium program. The full appropriations committee is expected to consider the bill no earlier than the week of April 18. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has yet to work on the measure.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will clash directly for the first time next week over raising the $ 3.35 hourly minimum wage, with more skirmishes expected before the nation's 5 million lowest paid workers get an increase. Leaders of both parties in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> agreed Friday to hold back-to-back votes Tuesday _ the first on the latest Democratic version for annual increases of 40 cents an hour to $ 4.55 by October 1991, and the second on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s offer of yearly 30-cent boosts to $ 4.25 by January 1992. Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> conceded his party and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> are likely to lose both votes. But <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> expressed confidence of a victory when the president vetoes the measure, as he promised again Friday, and Democrats attempt to override the veto. The chief sponsor of the raise, Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., acknowledged he lacks the 16 additional votes needed to muster a two-thirds majority for overriding a presidential veto `` I would hope they do n't again lay down this line in the sand,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said, challenging the administration's insistence on no more compromises. `` They've come a long way, we've come a long way.'' Democrats on Friday subtracted a dime from the $ 4.65 federal floor on wages they had wanted, and they accepted for the first time a 60-day subminimum `` training wage'' for workers entering their first job. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, however, told reporters he had `` no intention of budging one inch'' on allowing a minimum wage that high or on accepting that short a period during which employers could pay a `` training wage'' 20 percent below the federal floor. `` I will veto any bill which exceeds a $ 4.25 wage level and which does not contain a six-month training wage for new hires,'' he said in a letter Friday to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. The latest Democratic plan was put together by <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and Sens. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. Except for minor differences on the subminimum scale, it is identical to a bill passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last month. In the House version, an employer could pay the lower subminimum skill only to workers in their first job. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> measure would require a worker to have at least 60 days' experience in one or more jobs before any employer would have to pay the higher scale. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s subminimum would allow employers to continue paying $ 3.35 to any new hires, regardless of their previous experience, for six months. That subminimum would rise to $ 3.40 an hour in 1992 under the president's proposal while the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> would do away with it entirely then.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> bugged the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> charged in a statement that called the action reprehensible no matter how long ago the listening devices were planted. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday the listening devices were discovered in early February during an inspection by security personnel. `` Such hostile attempts at intelligence gathering, however long ago they may have been initiated, are deeply resented by the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' the department said it had told the Soviets in a protest. The devices in the consulate, which was opened in 1973, were discovered by officers from the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diplomatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION>, the statement said. According to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, the devices were implanted `` deep in the structure a long time ago.'' He declined to provide further details. In 1985, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accused the Soviets of planting listening devices in the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy chancery in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. In 1987, a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> guard, Sgt. <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lonetree </PERSON>, was accused and court-martialed on charges he permitted <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> intelligence agents to gain access to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy. The latest accusation of Soviet intrusion was unexpected. The two governments were in the process of deciding whether to open new consulates in <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, meanwhile, was in the midst of deciding what to do about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The two aides he sent there on an inspection trip returned two weeks ago with a recommendation to salvage part of the chancery, an administration official said Wednesday. The inspection was conducted by <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Salgo </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Selin </PERSON>, who has been nominated to be undersecretary of state for management. They told <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> on their return that refurbishing the building or even constructing an annex would be cheaper than razing the chancery and starting over. The estimated cost of tearing down and rebuilding the structure is $ 500 million. A trade group headed by <PERSON> Dwayne </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Archer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daniels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, offered to buy the building for use as business offices. <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> is co-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which promotes trade between the two superpowers.

 Six American software companies have accused three Italian companies of pirating their programs in an unprecedented copyright infringment lawsuit, company officials said Friday. The lawsuit, filed Thursday in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, accuses the European companies of unauthorized copying of software produced by <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. and <ORGANIZATION> Ashton-Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Torrance </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Elettrocarbonium </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.p.A. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Montedison </ORGANIZATION>, S.p.A. and its affiliate, <ORGANIZATION> Montefibre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.p.A. </ORGANIZATION> were named as co-defendants in the lawsuit filed by the <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Software </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, D.C.-based industry group. The lawsuit did not specify what compensation the group was seeking. <ORGANIZATION> BSA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said the group would likely file additional lawsuits against several other companies in the months to come. `` The level of unauthorized copying of software in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> _ not only by dealers but by organizational users _ is one of the most egregious in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said in a prepared statement. The breach had cost companies trying to develop and market legitimate software hundreds of millions of dollars, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said. Technical experts found evidence of widespread software duplication during inspections ordered by the Italian courts and conducted last week at two of the accused firms, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said. He said more than 90 percent of the software inspected at <ORGANIZATION> Montedison </ORGANIZATION> was reproduced without authorization and 80 percent of the software inspected at <LOCATION> Elettrocarbonium </LOCATION> consisted of unauthorized copies. Officials at the Milan-based Montedision and its affiliate have denied the charges. <ORGANIZATION> BSA </ORGANIZATION> officials did not know whether <PERSON> Elettrocarbonium </PERSON> had also denied the allegations. <ORGANIZATION> BSA </ORGANIZATION> was founded in 1988 to promote free and open trade in legitimate business software while protecting intellectual property.

<HEAD>Nurse Says School Ridiculed Her Weight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A nurse has sued her former instructors for allegedly ridiculing her weight and using her as an example of how difficult it would be to care for an obese person. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, now a nurse at All Children's Hospital in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, sued <ORGANIZATION> Salve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and five faculty members contending they violated an implied contract by refusing to let her complete school, invaded her privacy and caused her emotional distress. She is seeking unspecified damages. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> was told in 1985 that she would not be allowed to return for her senior year because she had failed to lose weight over the summer. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> testified in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Thursday that instructor <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> once told her there was no uniform to fit her and said, `` You'll never make it around the bed because you're too big. Another instructor, Sister <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hines </PERSON>, on one occasion `` had me get into bed to show -LRB- classmates -RRB- it's more difficult to make a bed with an overweight person in it,'' <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said. `` I was embarrassed and humiliated.'' The nun also once grabbed her arm and said how difficult it was to give an injection through obese tissue, <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> testified. The nurse, who completed training at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, in 1987, also contends the school should pay damages because she lost a year of prospective employment. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>, the college's lawyer, said in his opening statement that the instructors `` knew better than she knew the physical demands that are placed upon a nurse in our society.'' <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> suffered from an eating disorder, was more than 200 pounds overweight and could not be fitted into a `` scrub gown,'' Snow said. He said the six unsatisfactory marks <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> received from her clinical instructors in 1984 all were related to her weight, but said she was ultimately given a passing grade in return for a promise to go on a diet. `` Time and time again she broke that promise,'' he said. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> was allowed to register for her senior year only on the understanding she would diet during the summer, and she did not, <PERSON> Snow </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Salve </PERSON> <PERSON> Regina </PERSON>, a private college in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, is administered by the Roman Catholic Sisters of Mercy.

<HEAD>North Says Administration Officials Knew of Hawk Shipments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Administration officials knew at the time about a November 1985 shipment of missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s defense. During his examination Friday of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>, defense attorney <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> brought out that top officials were given data from intelligence intercepts tracking the 1985 shipment almost hourly. North, examining one of the intercepts, noted the exact minute a plane touched down in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. North denied, however, that he falsely stated to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that no one in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government learned before 1986 that Hawk missiles had been shipped to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in November 1985. <PERSON> North </PERSON> testified that although he was at a meeting Nov. 20, 1986, where congressional testimony was discussed, he played no part in shaping prepared testimony. According to the evidence, those receiving summaries of such intercepts included national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> or North and <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> or his deputy. Also receiving them were <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> and his deputy. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> sat in on the Nov. 20, 1986, meeting which was intended to prepare him and national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> for congressional appearances on the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> initiative the next day, according to testimony. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> participants brought to the meeting a proposed insert saying the spy agency had been told the shipment was oil drilling equipment. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> had arranged, at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s request, to have one of its airlines transport the <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION> in 1985, but did so without first getting a presidential finding. North recalled that as the Iran-Contra affair unfolded in November 1986, he spoke to his former boss, <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, about the shipment of Hawks. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> said that it did n't happen, <PERSON> North </PERSON> said. `` You knew it happened?'' asked <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. `` Yes sir,'' replied North. `` He called me up from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and made it happen.'' In testimony during <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial, <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> had a different recollection. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> said <PERSON> North </PERSON> told him that `` he believed he and I had n't learned the precise details of what happened until'' 12 months after the shipment. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> said he doubted at the time of the 1986 conversation that <PERSON> North </PERSON> was correct, but that his own memory of the 1985 shipment was hazy so that he could n't contradict North. As a result, <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> said, he changed a chronology of the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms shipments, removing a reference to the November 1985 shipment of <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION> and substituting instead a more general reference to other transfers of equipment.

<TEXT>
 SULLIVAN: When you were having the discussions with Mr. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> back in August and September of 1985 as to how to answer these congressmen, you were arguing to him that he should not respond. Did it ever occur to you that his response was unlawful? NORTH: No ... in fact, ... it never occurred to me the letter could be a violation of the law. SULLIVAN: Had you ever heard of a circumstance in which a letter from a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> officer to a congressman would be the basis for a criminal charge? NORTH: No, these were political disputes. This was a political battle the likes of which I guess <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has a lot of them. It was a nasty political dispute. It was politics at its worst but it never occurred to me, I've never heard of it before or since until this, that that kind of a thing could be unlawful. ... I mean my argument -LRB- against responding to <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> -RRB- was n't based on something being unlawful. My argument was based on the fact that if there's ever a chance to use this kind of privilege, authority, it ought to be used on this. ... it never occurred to me that it was unlawful. <PERSON> SULLIVAN </PERSON>: The next thing that happens, let's go to June 1986. What does the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> do at that time with regard to a resolution of inquiry? -LRB- The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> resolution formally requested information on North's activities. -RRB- What was the conclusion you drew -LRB- from this resolution -RRB-? NORTH: Well, the conclusion I drew is this was just one more chapter in this very bitter political dispute in which both sides were pulling out all the stops. ... -LRB- Our response was -RRB- the fact that we've answered these questions before, meaning Mr. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>'s answers the year before ... -LRB- North then discusses an informal meeting with Rep. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> situation room on Aug. 6, 1986. -RRB- SULLIVAN: What did that mean to you, informal? Off the record? NORTH: I guess my sense of it was that this was simply an effort to stop the inquiries ... SULLIVAN: Did you ever think you would be in a courtroom some day in 1989 being charged with a crime because of a meeting that occurred on August 6th, 1986, which was off the record, informal? NORTH: No, sir. SULLIVAN: Did you tell them the truth at that meeting on August 6th, 1986? NORTH: No. SULLIVAN: When you did n't disclose information they were looking at, did you believe that your conduct was unlawful? NORTH: No, I did n't think it was unlawful but I was raised to know the difference between right and wrong. I knew it was n't right not to tell the truth on those things, but I did n't think it was unlawful. <PERSON> SULLIVAN </PERSON>: How did you feel about being told by your boss to go into a meeting on August 6th, 1986? NORTH: I felt like a pawn in a chess game being played by giants. ... I had been told specifically that the Saudi aid that the president had gotten and that Mr. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> had gotten will never be revealed. And by this time we were also using monies from the sale of arms to the <LOCATION> Nicaraguan </LOCATION> resistance _ to the <LOCATION> Iranians </LOCATION> to help the Nicaraguan resistance, and that would never be revealed. <PERSON> SULLIVAN </PERSON>: Was it your understanding that if you answered frankly the questions that were asked in that session that it would lead to being confronted with having to reveal some of those things? NORTH: Yes, and that's why I did n't think that that meeting was a good idea. <PERSON> SULLIVAN </PERSON>: And did you tell Admiral <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> that? NORTH: I did. <PERSON> SULLIVAN </PERSON>: And what was his decision? NORTH: You can take care of it. -LRB- North describes exchanges in which his superior, Adm. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>'s successor as national security adviser, discussed concerns that too many people were beginning to find out what <PERSON> North </PERSON> is doing in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. -RRB- NORTH: He ... told me that I ... must generate a cover story; just do n't be letting people know where you are going, what you are doing and why you are doing it. And so I did so. SULLIVAN: Now -LRB- <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> -RRB- speaks of `` operational roles''.. what did you understand it to mean NORTH: Well, he specifically said to me, that goes for the terrorism business, that goes for the hostage business, that goes for all the reasons that you're doing with the resistance.

 Animal-rights activists say letting bulls loose in an arena with rodeo clowns will exploit and mentally torment the animals. `` It is morally, ethically and legally wrong to torment an animal to the point where it's going to charge you,'' said <PERSON> Raini </PERSON> <PERSON> Sequoya </PERSON>, president of the Tampa-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` If these clowns really want to have some fun, they should get in the ring and torment each other. Why pick on a helpless animal?'' But organizers of this weekend's <ORGANIZATION> Odessa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rodeo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Yukon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Days </ORGANIZATION> said nothing is wrong with the crowd-pleasing event. `` I do n't understand. Is waving a flag in a bull's face more cruel than getting on his back and riding him?'' said organizer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Burchell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rodeo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cowboy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, was taken aback by the criticism `` This is great. ... A clown goes out and stands in the middle of an arena and they let a bull out to chase him _ kind of like turning a bulldog loose on a mailman _ and people are worried for the bull,'' said <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>. The event is for clowns to display their bravery and talent, he said. The clowns have 70 seconds to show judges how they avoid getting killed. They ca n't touch the bull or use weapons and have only a barrel to crawl into. The activists had vowed to seek an injunction to stop the event on the grounds that it breaks <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s 88-year-old animal cruelty law. But they had not done so by Friday, and were considering plans to file legal action after the event.

<TEXT>
 Her voice trembling with pain and then anger, <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Bright </PERSON> recalled her late husband and lambasted what she called the callousness of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials following the bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103. `` After suffering the unimaginable loss of my husband, I have had to fight to get information. That's not right,'' said Mrs. Bright, the mother of a 19-month-old son, echoing complaints from other victims' family members. A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing room was hushed Friday, the only sound an occasional muffled cry from other family members, as the 32-year-old widow from <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, told about the difficulties of getting information from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> following the Dec. 21 terrorist bombing over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> that claimed 270 victims. `` I call <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, I call <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, and in anger and frustration I call other victims,'' she told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations terrorism subcommittee. `` The stories never end,'' she said. `` Memorials unattended by <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials. Someone told to come ` pick up the shipment' when her husband's body arrived from <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. Someone else watched as the body of her loved one was lifted off a platform using a forklift. One widow was told it was time to realize that her husband was dead and get on with her life.'' Mrs. Bright, unable to steady her voice, told a subcommittee headed by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., of her own experiences _ how it was nine hours after the accident before the airline called, how the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> did not call for days and how the only answers at the accident scene in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, came from Scottish officials `` I learned through my husband's employer that <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> was seated in seat 14A, directly over the bomb,'' she said. `` I need to know what that meant. Was he ever aware of what was happening? Was he ever afraid? Was he in pain? `` It was not until February that I learned by chance that an autopsy had been performed on <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON>. All of this information should have given by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, but it was n't. Why were they silent? Instead of me being allowed to grieve for the loss of my husband, I was forced to seek out answers on my own.'' `` As my husband so strongly believed, there is a right answer and it's worth fighting for. The right answer is that we need a responsive, informative and compassionate <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>,'' Mrs. Bright said. `` It would not have taken a lot of manpower or dollars to have dealt with this differently.'' Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> defended the government's response, saying the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had planned to contact next-of-kin, but <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> wanted to do it and the government has `` no legal authority to compel an airline to give us a passenger list.'' `` Our objective was to spare -LRB- the families -RRB- as much anguish as possible,'' she said. `` We refrained, however, from taking a more active role with family members for fear of intruding unnecessarily during that time of tragedy and shock.'' But she conceded that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has `` learned a great deal from this experience'' and `` are reviewing our methods for handling crises and are making appropriate changes.'' She said the government is seeking an agreement with the major airlines to coordinate emergency action plans. In addition, the department has organized an 18-member special family liaison group to provide one-on-one information for each family of the Flight 103 disaster and is considering an 800 telephone number in disaster situations. <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> joined the family members in calling for a new policy to tell passengers about terrorist threats and to increase airport security checks even if it means much longer waiting times for passengers. <PERSON> Monte </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Belger </PERSON>, associate administrator at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said he believes new government regulations mandating devices to detect plastic explosives and other changes ordered in the wake of the Flight 103 disaster are sufficient.

 Powerful currents and a channel that's tough to negotiate may have been partly to blame for the grounding of an Exxon tanker on a sandbar in the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> official said. The 617-foot Exxon <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, carrying 13 million gallons of oil products, got stuck Friday on the muddy bottom near the mouth of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Four tugboats freed it after seven hours. No oil spilled from the ship. `` Where the river's at now, it's tricky down there,'' said Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Klotz </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s district headquarters. <PERSON> Klotz </PERSON> said the river is rising and currents are powerful where the ship went aground _ a point where the main channel splits into three smaller channels emptying into the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. He said the river is 38 to 39 feet deep there, though the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> tries to maintain a 45-foot depth. <PERSON> Klotz </PERSON>, who inspected the grounded <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wilmington </ORGANIZATION> from a helicopter, said checks of the ship's double hull indicated it was undamaged. The <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION> steamed Friday night to an anchorage in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> where <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> inspectors were to give its hull a final check for damage before letting it proceed to a refinery at Bayway, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> is investigating why the <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION> ran aground. The ship was loaded with more than 8 million gallons of jet fuel and nearly 5 million gallons of other petroleum products, mainly paraffin. It took on the cargo at the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> refinery at <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Reidy </PERSON>. It was the second Exxon tanker to run aground. On March 24, the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> struck a reef in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> and spilled 10.1 million barrels of oil in the worst spill in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history.

<TEXT>
 Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> ended a six-day tour of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> by announcing nuclear cutbacks and inviting <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> to visit <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said Friday that the queen gave `` a very definite yes,'' but that no date had been set. She would be the first British sovereign to visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> since the 1917 revolution. Her Russian ancestors _ the family of <PERSON> Czar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> _ were slain by revolutionaries eight decades ago. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s invitation to the queen indicated his success in winning Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s trust. In addition, televised pictures of the <ORGANIZATION> Gorbachevs </ORGANIZATION> being escorted around <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> by the 63-year-old queen and her husband, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Philip </PERSON>, further warmed the royalty-loving British to the Soviet leader. Despite the invitation and the cordiality, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> disagreed on issues of nuclear disarmament and the balance of East-West forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, moreover, downplayed the importance of the Soviet leader's promise to halt production of weapons-grade uranium and shut down two more plutonium-producing reactors by the end of 1990. Nevertheless, she declared <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s third visit to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> `` very successful, warm and friendly,'' echoing his assertion that it had strengthened British-Soviet ties. The Gorbachevs' 40-hour British stay ended with a day steeped in pageantry. The president gave an unusually brief, 27-minute speech in the splendid setting of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s Guildhall, the 1,000-year-old seat of city government filled with city leaders in wigs and robes. In remarks broadcast live in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> called his proposals for cutting production of radioactive material `` another major step toward the complete cessation of production of fissionable materials for use in nuclear weapons.'' However, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> later ascribed little importance to the moves, saying existing Soviet stockpiles would mean the cutbacks `` will have no effect in practice.'' A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said the weapons reactors could be started when the Soviet military runs low. The Soviet step followed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s December announcement to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would soon cut 500,000 soldiers from its standing army and withdraw troops and tanks from <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> and Chinese frontiers. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> lauded <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for unilaterally eliminating chemical weapons stocks. He said his country had built a facility for destroying its own chemical weapons, and he would soon invite British experts to inspect it. The president also said the West should drop plans to modernize short-range nuclear missiles, but Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> maintained a nuclear deterrent was essential. After lunch at <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Gorbachevs </PERSON> were driven to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, where they flew home to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.

 -LRB- North resumes his testimony after a lunch break. -RRB- SULLIVAN: Would you read this letter. Is it a letter or the back and front of a postcard of some sort? Do you recall? NORTH: This appears to be a copy of a card with the front and back written on it, yes, sir. SULLIVAN: All right. Would you read that to the jury, please. This is from Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in November 1985. NORTH: It says, `` en route to <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>'s 11-29-85. <PERSON> Dear </PERSON> <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON>, as I head off to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> for Thanksgiving, I just want to wish you a happy one with the hope that you get some well deserved rest. One with the hope that you get some well deserved rest. One of the many things I have to be thankful for is the way ... in which you have performed under fire in tough situations. `` Your dedication and tireless work with the hostage thing and with <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> really gives me cause for great pride in you, and thanks. Get some turkey. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' SULLIVAN: That was received in November 1985 ... correct? NORTH: Yes, sir. SULLIVAN: Now ... would you explain to the jury, please, how it is that you got involved in your office with trying to rescue hostages? NORTH: The hostage problem was part of the overall program of combating terrorism that the administration had, and it was a very important element of it because we had an increasing number of hostages being held. ... A consultant who was working for the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION>, Mr. <PERSON> Ledeen </PERSON> ... had brought back from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> information that they thought that they could achieve an opening to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, to moderate elements within the Iranian government, that there was great polarization, great disarray in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, that the Israelis were fairly sure of their information and had an agent working for them that could put us in touch with them. And it involved the exchange of certain <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> weapons to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> which could result in the release of both Israeli hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and the American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. SULLIVAN: Colonel, would you explain why you are dealing with the country of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> if the hostages were in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>? NORTH: Within <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, there were several groups of Shia fundamentalists, Moslem fundamentalists who had political loyalty to the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. ... and so the Israelis, and we agreed, though that if you could influence some of the more moderate elements in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to cut them off financially, or to convince them to turn loose the American hostages and the Jewish hostages that were being held, along with some other europeans like the French and Italians and British ... SULLIVAN: Were there missiles sent to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and did a hostage come out as a result? NORTH: Yes, it did. -LRB- The hostage was Rev. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Weir </PERSON> -RRB- ... I took, at the direction of the president, a letter from the president to meet Mr. <PERSON> Weir </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reverend </PERSON> <PERSON> Weir </PERSON>; met with him; had a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> airplane take me to the meeting, in an effort to assure <PERSON> Reverend </PERSON> <PERSON> Weir </PERSON> that his cooperation was necessary for us to be able to help rescue the other _ or recover the other hostages. -LRB- North describes how he continued meeting with Israeli intermediaries in an attempt to open up discussions with moderates in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in an attempt to gain the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages being held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. -RRB- NORTH: I went and talked to Mr. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> about this in terms of how far we were going on this initiative and what role we were to play. And he told me simply that we were going to allow the Israelis to proceed with this, that it was their initiative and that we were to simply position the necessary people in the right places to be able to safely recover the hostages and be prepared for a high level meeting with the Iranians. <PERSON> SULLIVAN </PERSON>: Colonel, let's focus on the dates ... a little bit here. September,'85, <LOCATION> TOW </LOCATION> missiles are shipped, is that correct? NORTH: I believe so, yes, sir. ... SULLIVAN: You were not involved in the earliest stages of that, correct? NORTH: No, but at one point I did ask Mr. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> if the president approved it and he told me he had. -LRB- North describes a shipment of Hawk missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> through the Israelis to get the hostages freed. -RRB- SULLIVAN: Were the transportation and logistical problems -LRB- with the shipment -RRB- eventually worked out? NORTH: Yes, they were from purely the transportation problem. But they were n't worked out as far as the Iranians were concerned. ... -LRB- the missiles -RRB- were eventually shipped and they did arrive in a city in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, not <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, but another city, and it was n't the full 80 that they had asked for. It was only 18, I believe. <PERSON> SULLIVAN </PERSON>: And was it anticipated that hostages would be released as a result of this November,'85 Hawk shipment? NORTH: Yes, and we had gone to some lengths to position the appropriate people to receive them. ... we had no operational role in this other than to recover the hostages when they were released. We were n't planning any of this. We were kind of responding to it. SULLIVAN: Now, Colonel, focusing your attention after the Hawk shipment could you describe to the jury what problem arose after the <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION> arrived in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>? Did a hostage get out as anticipated? NORTH: On the November shipment, no. Apparently what the Iranians had been told by the Israeli agent was something different than what they expected. And they were to put it mildly very angry over what was delivered in that November shipment. The November shipment was 18 Hawk missiles and they had apparently expected something entirely different. ... the Iranians ... came back to the Israelis very, very upset about what had transpired and they said that they'd been cheated and that therefore nobody was going to be released, no Israelis, no Americans, no Europeans, nobody.

<HEAD>Major Streamlining of Nuclear Licensing Adopted by NRC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> hopes its streamlining of the nuclear licensing process will keep the industry alive by cutting the time needed to build a nuclear power plant by roughly half. The new licensing procedures, approved by the five-member commission without dissent on Friday, have been under development for more than two years and have been the subject of hearings and briefings. The commission staff, utility executives and other analysts have said that there was no chance anyone would ever build another plant without some licensing simplification, although there is no sign that any utilities are close to seeking approval. The procedures try to resolve all major issues before a decision on whether to go ahead with a plant. They provide for advance approval of plant designs that could be used with little further examination, and of sites that utilities could designate far in advance of need. Also, the commission would go a long way toward the much-discussed `` one-stop'' license, issuing a combined construction permit and operating license. License applicants could still use the old procedure but the commission does not expect anyone to do so. Site approval would be good for 20 years. Without new legislation, which the commission has been unable to win, the procedure can not be completely one-stop. Under current law, the commission still will have to hold both a licensing hearing and a hearing after a plant has been built before it can be started. The new combined license would be issued only after safety and site issues such as planning for emergency evacuations had been resolved. The range of issues that could be raised at the second hearing on whether license conditions had been met would be narrowed, and <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lando </PERSON> <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> told reporters he did not think legislation was necessary now. At the second hearing, issues would be limited to allegations of `` material and uncorrected non-conformance'' with license conditions, or that `` adequate protection'' of the public is in jeopardy. Failure of state and local governments to cooperate in emergency planning has held up licensing of the completed <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> plant on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> plant on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> coast. Under the new procedure, an applicant would have to show a `` good faith'' effort to win such cooperation in evacuation planning and that the plan could work even without it. These issues are not even considered under the current procedure until the plant is finished and the question before the commission is whether to allow operation. Huge cost escalations, a drastic slowing of growth in electricity demand in the past decade and fears generated by the partial core melt of the Three Mile Island plant in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> in 1979 and other accidents combined years ago to kill new orders for an industry that provides 18 percent of the nation's electricity.

<TEXT>
 The Soviet Embassy confirmed that a nuclear-powered submarine suffered an underwater accident and sank in international waters off northern <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, according to a radio report Saturday. Defense Minister <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Holst </PERSON> said on Norwegian Radio that estimates of about 12 fatalities from the sinking Friday of the Soviet `` Mike'' class submarine appeared accurate. Some crewmen apparently were rescued, <PERSON> Holst </PERSON> said but he provided no details. A Norwegian Orion reconnaissance plane saw Soviet ships and planes circling the accident site north of the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION> before nightfall Friday. A second <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> passed over the area after midnight and spotted an oil slick on the sea, <PERSON> Holst </PERSON> said. He said a Soviet cruiser was en route to the scene, and that Norwegian vessels had made no attempts to approach the site, 118 miles south-southwest of <LOCATION> Bear </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and 312 miles off <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. Norwegian experts were meeting Saturday morning to discuss the situation and keep the government informed about the possibility of a radiation leak, the broadcast said. By Saturday, more than 12 hours after the accident, there was no word on the accident from the Soviet government or the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency. The sea is 6,600 feet deep at the site of the sinking, and <PERSON> Holst </PERSON> said there was `` no hope'' of raising the sub from the bottom. Military officials in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said it appeared the boat caught fire underwater before breaking up and sinking. The submarine, nicknamed `` Mike'' by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, carries a crew of 95, is powered by two nuclear generators and is reportedly equipped with torpedoes and long-range ballistic missiles, Western sources say. The West German government radio also quoted <PERSON> Holst </PERSON> as saying pilots of reconnaissance planes reported seeing bodies at the site. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said there `` definitely'' were casualties aboard, but declined to estimate how many. `` The only thing we saw was an oil slick about three to four hundred meters long by 50 to 100 meters wide,'' Capt. <PERSON> Haavard </PERSON> <PERSON> Holm </PERSON>, the Orion reconnaissance pilot, said on Norwegian Radio after flying over the accident site. He said there were three Russian ships and one aircraft in the area, including a trawler, a freezer ship and what appeared to be an observation or intelligence vessel. <PERSON> Holst </PERSON> said he doubted the Soviets had sent the cruiser to keep other ships away. `` They want to have as much support as possible and want to transfer the survivors and the possible dead,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said earlier that the reconnaissance plane had seen Soviet planes and boats, including rubber dinghies with people in at least one of them. It was not clear whether the people were from the submarine or the surface vessels. `` With the observations we have made with the Soviet vessels and planes in the area, it seems the Soviets can handle this case alone,'' <PERSON> Holst </PERSON> said. The area is well above the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION>, but is usually ice-free because of the Gulf Stream. Temperatures in the area were near-freezing on Friday. The `` Mike'' is one of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s modern submarines, and the only one in operation, according to <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s Fighting Ships, the British reference book. If Western descriptions of the submarine are accurate, `` the reactors are well-protected and have less radioactive material than in older submarines.'' said <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> Baarli </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radiation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> He said on national radio that any radioactive material probably would remain in the sub and not escape into the sea. Norwegian and Swedish defense sources estimate the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has about 110 nuclear submarines operating in northern waters from bases on the <LOCATION> Kola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, one of the world's heaviest concentrations of naval power. The `` Mike'' might carry 16 missiles for surface targets, although the figure is unconfirmed, said Swedish <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gur </PERSON>.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration plans to construct a new federal penitentiary in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suburbs and a temporary jail in the city to help fight the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s drug and violent crime problem. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in their editions today that national drug control policy director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> will announce his plans Monday. The reports, citing unidentified sources, said the plan will call for <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> troops to perform clerical jobs to free up police officers, and an enhanced role for federal law enforcement agents in the city's anti-drug efforts. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s deputy chief of staff, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Tell </PERSON>, said late Friday that he could not comment on the reports. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> has targeted the nation's capital, where an epidemic drug-related killings have earned the city the title of `` murder capital,'' in his national campaign against drugs. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported that the wide-ranging federal effort will include the use of forensic experts at the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to help reduce the mounting backlog of unsolved homicide cases, and <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> funds will be used to pay for police overtime. In addition, a <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> local task force will be expanded, with more than a dozen supervisory <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents brought in to help local police officials manage major drug cases, and five intelligence analysts from the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will be detailed to help track drug dealing. There have been 132 homicides, most of them drug-related, in the district this year compared with 87 at the same time in 1988, when the city had a record 372 murders. Among the plans outlined by the officials, according to the newspapers, were these: _ A new prison would be built to relieve overcrowding at a 6,000-inmate facility, the district-operated <LOCATION> Lorton </LOCATION> Reformatory prison complex in suburban <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, beginning in fiscal year 1991 _ About 200 to 300 prisoners would be transferred temporarily from <LOCATION> Lorton </LOCATION> to federal prisons around the country Such transfers have occurred in the past because of the overcrowding. _ A contingent from the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> would be assigned to the city to make evictions in the estimated 200 to 300 crack houses that thrive here, and to help the local police apprehend suspects on outstanding warrants. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will use intelligence officials to analyze international drug trafficking _ The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to assign about 15 officials temporarily to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to double an existing task force that coordinates efforts by regional police departments to pursue drug offenders An administration official familiar with the plan told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meade </ORGANIZATION>, an Army post near <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, which houses the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and various military facilities, `` is one of the options'' under study for the new federal penitentiary but that no final decision has been made.

 Twenty years after they seized an administration building in protest of the Establishment, former student rebels gathered to show they may be older but they still have n't sold out. Some of the more than 200 people who participated in the takeover arrived Friday, sporting vintage anti-war buttons and worn T-shirts. `` It was the end of writing letters to the editor and the beginning of being really active,'' said <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheever </PERSON>, 39, a veterinarian and animal rights activist in <LOCATION> Voorheesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` I'm really proud of our generation,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Cheever </PERSON>, who said she came to see old friends and remind herself that she participated in a time that changed <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The two-day reunion included a kickoff rally where new student activists joined the veterans in invoking anti-war sentiments as well as raising questions about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and apartheid in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Also planned were a teach-in, debates and a party. The alumni were marking an event that began shortly after noon April 9, 1969, when about 300 students seized <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s main administration building. They threw out nine deans and locked the doors with chains, ignoring orders to leave. As dawn broke the following day, more than 400 state and local police stormed the building at the request of then-Harvard President <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pusey </PERSON>. Some students were pulled out by their hair. About 45 people were hurt, some after jumping from windows, and 197 were arrested. The brutality of the arrests and <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s willingness to use police galvanized students. A three-day boycott of classes stretched into a 15-day strike in which students virtually commandeered the school. When the strike officially ended April 25, classes were over and many exams canceled. School administrators had satisfied most of the protesters' demands, including abolishing the campus <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, setting up a department of African and Afro-American studies and agreeing to build low-cost housing for people displaced by the school's expansion projects `` What happened in 1969 revealed to me how the world really worked _ and the government and <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and business and the role of the police,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>, 40, a computer software designer in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` Over the years, it's helped me understand what I read in the newspapers and to question everything I hear,'' <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> said. The university has made its facilities available for the reunion but is not taking part officially and has no comment on the gathering. <PERSON> Pusey </PERSON> was not attending the reunion. <PERSON> Pusey </PERSON>, 82, and living in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said there was `` no way'' he would participate in the reunion. `` It was just a lot of screaming,'' said <PERSON> Pusey </PERSON>, who ran <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> from 1953 to 1971. `` I was disappointed that any students or any faculty at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> accepted the notion that somehow <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> was the source of evil and should be attacked.'' <PERSON> Pusey </PERSON>, who says reports of violence were untrue, blamed the events on a small group of student agitators. `` I honestly did not think the students and faculty at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> would be taken in by these ridiculous things being said,'' he said Friday.

 Soviet troops and tanks surrounded the main square and TV station Saturday in the Georgian capital of <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> in an effort to end strikes and protests spurred by nearly a week of ethnic unrest, an activist said. <PERSON> Irina </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarishvili </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview from the southern Soviet republic that thousands of protesters had surrounded themselves with buses and trolleys in the square to ward off the soldiers and tanks. <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> soldiers and tanks were deployed Friday after a protest in which as many as 100,000 people took part, and a strike that closed down the official television station, schools and public transportation, she said. Ms. <PERSON> Sarishvili </PERSON> said small groups of soldiers were patroling the streets and that more troops were in nearby buses. About 1,500 police officers had been brought in from other regions of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, she said. She said that as of midmorning Saturday thousands of more Georgians were on the streets of the capital city. She said there had been no violence in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> and other organizers of the protest are demanding independence from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but they accuse the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> of stirring up unrest in the autonomous region of <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION>, located within <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Georgian </LOCATION> activists say there were clashes between Georgians and Abkhazians last weekend in the resort city of <LOCATION> Sukhumi </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> radio news in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said more than 100,000 people had taken part in the demonstration in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> to show their opposition to a campaign by some groups for more autonomy in the <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION> region of northwestern <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> dispatch said 100 ethnic Georgians had begun a hunger strike to show their anger at the autonomy campaign. On Thursday a Georgian activist reported scores of Georgian nationalists demanding independence for <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> were on a hunger strike in front of government buildings in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chanturia </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview that 158 Georgians began a hunger strike Tuesday and plan to continue it until April 14, the anniversary of a demonstration for ethnic rights in 1978. The hunger strikers and thousands of others have been meeting outside government offices in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> demanding <LOCATION> Georgian </LOCATION> independence, <PERSON> Chanturia </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported Thursday from <LOCATION> Sukhumi </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, <PERSON> B.V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adleiba </PERSON>, has been replaced by V.F. <PERSON> Khishba </PERSON>. <PERSON> Khishba </PERSON> was first deputy chairman of the Georgian republic's environment committee in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Tensions have been running high in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> region for more than a year, mainly in the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region, an ethnically Armenian region that was under control of neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. Last fall, demonstrators marched in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> with a variety of demands ranging from Georgian independence to the manufacture of more Georgian-language typewriters.

 SULLIVAN: What happened next? NORTH: Immediately thereafter Mr. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in late November, early December, and very shortly thereafter submitted his resignation from the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION>. We were being pressed by the Israelis, I was personally, as to where we were going from here. And so Mr. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> agreed to go to a meeting with the Israeli agents and the Iranian in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. I flew over to the meeting, met General <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> there. He had established that it was a safe meeting. We sat down and talked with Mr. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> and the Israelis and their agent who was an Iranian, and we came back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. -LRB- North describes three separate presidential intelligence findings that were signed in connection with the Hawk missile shipments to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. -RRB- SULLIVAN: Now, did each of these findings state that there should be no immediate reporting to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>? NORTH: All of them said that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> shall not be notified at this time and that the president had the authority to withhold that notification until he deemed it was appropriate. SULLIVAN: During the time that you had operational control over it, was it considered to be among the most secret of government activity that was being undertaken in 1986? NORTH: Absolutely. ... -LRB- <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> asks <PERSON> North </PERSON> in detail about terrorists threats leveled against him and a decision by <PERSON> North </PERSON> to accept installation of a security system at his home. The system was provided by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> major general who had been enlisted by North to run arms to the Contras. -RRB- SULLIVAN: Did you pay for the security system? NORTH: No, I did not. SULLIVAN: Did you receive a security system for or because of any official act that you had performed or that you were going to perform in the future? NORTH: No. SULLIVAN: Did you receive it as any form of compensation because you were a government official at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>? NORTH: No. SULLIVAN: Did you intend to violate any law by receiving the security system without paying for it? NORTH: No. I intended to pay for it. SULLIVAN: But did you ever pay for it? NORTH: No, I did not. <LOCATION> SULLIVAN </LOCATION>: Colonel North, would you tell the jury briefly, please, why you and <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on a secret trip in May 1986? NORTH: The purpose of the trip was to carry out the express intention of the president that we open a dialogue with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> about the Iran-Iraq war, stop Iranian terrorism and get the American hostages home. ... SULLIVAN: Colonel, was there hope that on this particular trip that all the hostages would come back with you after the negotiations and after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> provided certain parts for missiles? NORTH: Not so much come back with us, but there was great hope because of what the Israeli agent, or intermediary, had told us were the conditions that the Iranians had, that as a consequence of going on this trip we would have the hostages released that were bing held in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, not in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>; that we would get <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> or his body _ we were n't too sure which at that point, although we had fairly good intelligence that he was dead _ and that we would get a 400-page interrogation -LRB- of <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> -RRB- that they had done. SULLIVAN: Did you leave without accomplishing your objectives on that trip? NORTH: Yes, we did. SULLIVAN: Now, Colonel, I would like to focus your attention on the last couple of months of your service at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> ... in early October, one of the planes flying resupply missions to the -LRB- Nicaraguan -RRB- freedom fighters was shot down, correct? NORTH: Yes, sir, it was. ... SULLIVAN: And did you have a plan how to deal with it? NORTH: Yes, we did and the press guidance was basically the same as what President <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> had done with <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON> when he was shot down over <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. That was to deny it. ... When the airplane was shot down over <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> I was in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> working with what we began to call the second channel on the Iranian initiative. And the initial exposure on the shootdown was that we would ... deny it. When I got back from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> -LRB- CIA -RRB- Director -LRB- <PERSON> William </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> asked me to come out to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. ... He asked me pointedly, he said, are we going to be clean on this? We being the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. And I said yes, I do n't think that there's going to be any way for anybody to take the wreckage or the people, the survivor and make any connection back to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> had, because the rules had changed, the law had changed, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> had been providing weather data and drop zone data, intelligence data but they did n't have any <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> employees on the airplane, they did n't have any <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> mechanics working on it, no <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> purchased equipment was on it because we were still living within those constraints of the Boland amendment and he wanted my assurance because he knew that I was basically the operations officer for this activity, that there was nothing that was going to trace back to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and I assured him, incorrectly, that no, everything would be fine. And it turned out that there was data aboard the airplane, that the information that Mr. <PERSON> Hasenfus </PERSON> gave his captors traced back to where they had launched from, the house that they were living in, documents that were able to trace it back to the fact that they had gotten information from the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. SULLIVAN: Colonel, did you also learn that <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> had received information that perhaps the Iranian initiative would be exposed because certain creditors of the operation had not received their money? NORTH: At that same luncheon Director <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> also told me that an old friend of his, a source I think he told me, of many years back had revealed to him that certain of the people who had been funding the purchases of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> equipment -LRB- for the Iranian arms deal -RRB- were upset by the fact that they had not been paid -LRB- and -RRB- ... that it was about to be revealed, that there was a secret arms deal going with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and that monies from the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> initiative were going to help the Contras. Directory <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> knew all that but his concern was that we do whatever we could to keep this from coming out.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Loyalist troops at the National Palace shelled an adjoining army barracks Friday and apparently routed mutineers demanding the ouster of <LOCATION> Haitian </LOCATION> leader Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>. Western diplomats said the Presidential Guard attacked <ORGANIZATION> Dessalines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barracks </ORGANIZATION>, where the rebel soldiers were dug in. There were unconfirmed reports the elite Leopards unit, also in rebellion against <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, had abandoned their base in the suburbs without a fight when they realized all was lost. A government source close to <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, in power for six stormy months, said early Saturday that `` the government is in control of the situation.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> also said she thought the battle was over. `` We stand by our statement of the past few days. We support President <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> so that he can return to his work for the establishment of democracy,'' <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> said. There were unconfirmed reports of casualties among soldiers and civilians. One report said shells overshot their mark and hit nearby houses. But officials at the state hospital across a blocked street from the barracks said they had no casualties from the fighting. And no casualties were reported at the military hospital, a nearby private hospital that caters to wealthy Haitians or by the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. Diplomats said a cease-fire had been declared after three hours' fighting, although sporadic gunfire continued elsewhere A man listening on a citizens-band radio heard soldiers saying the barracks had been overrun by loyalist troops and that the rebels were disarmed and forced to lie on the floor face-down with their hands over their heads. The white, neo-classical palace and the mustard-colored barracks adjoin one other and are surrounded by the same wall. The action began at 7:40 p.m. and reporters watched from a second-floor terrace of the Holiday Inn as at least one armored car of the 1,000-member Presidential Guard rumbled across the plaza in front of the palace and fired its cannon. Guardsmen took positions in the plaza. It appeared five armored cars surrounded the barracks, and within 20 minutes more than a dozen cannon shots accompanied by steady machine gun fire could be heard. Civilians fled the area, some rushing the doors of the hotel. Reporters dived for cover as explosions reverberated through the building and tracer bullets zipped overhead. State-run radio played romantic French songs during the fighting. It was impossible to determine the extent of support within the 7,000-man army for the rebellion centered on the 700-man <PERSON> Dessalines </PERSON> battalion, the military's second-biggest unit, and the 400-man Leopards unit. The rebels earlier Friday seized control of a radio station, and youths supporting them built barricades of burning tires along a main street. The rebel soldiers in a statement on Radio <PERSON> Soleil </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> of `` war crimes.'' <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Brunson </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON> earlier offered <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s support for <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>'s government, which foiled a coup attempt Sunday but has been stymied by the mutiny Rebels rode through the capital in jeeps, pickup trucks and motorbikes, shooting in the air and warning people to go home, witnesses said. Youths set fire to tires along the five-mile route of <LOCATION> Delmas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, a main artery in the capital. Stores, schools and offices in the capital were closed under a state of emergency. <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> at the National Palace on the third day of a standoff between loyalist troops and rebels, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said. On Thursday night, loyal troops fired on rebels who commandeered a government vehicle. Witnesses said four rebels were killed, but a diplomatic source said two died and one was wounded. Haitians were largely cut off from developments Thursday night after loyal troops cut the transmitter cables of at least three radio stations that had ignored censorship imposed by the government this week. Diplomatic sources said loyalist officers, including interim army chief Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>, went to <ORGANIZATION> Dessalines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barracks </ORGANIZATION> Thursday to speak to the rebels and returned with an understanding that a reconciliation agreement was reached. But the rebels reneged on the deal, said the sources. Radio <PERSON> Soleil </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic station that remained on the air, announced it was being occupied by mutinous soldiers. An unidentified soldier said they had seized the station to deny a statement by <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> that the rebels had decided to end their dispute. `` That's a lie,'' the soldier said. `` We are holding our ground.'' The rebels accuse the government of favoritism toward the Presidential Guard in pay and living conditions and of arbitrarily dismissing senior officers in a U.S.-backed crackdown on drugs and corruption. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, 50, came to power in a coup led by noncommissioned officers demanding democratic reforms and an end to state-sponsored violence. The coup ousted Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> has restored some constitutional rights suspended in 1987 and approved the establishment of an electoral council to prepare for elections. Thugs killed 34 voters in November 1987, thwarting <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s first free elections in more than 30 years.

 SULLIVAN: What was the danger in revealing the Iranian initiative in terms of the second channel and the hostages? NORTH: Well, the danger that we all saw was that you'd end up with the political fire storm we ended up with, I mean that actually happened, that you'd end up with exposure of the kind that even though officials within the Iranian government knew what was going on and officials within our government knew what was going on, that neither the Iranian public nor the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public were going to be particularly happy with this. -LRB- And -RRB- ... that the people in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> who held the hostages would be so outraged by this involvement.

NORTH: Well, the president had publicly said that they did n't happen either, which was initially part of the cover story SULLIVAN: What conclusion did you draw from that? NORTH: ... I had no idea what was in the minds of other people but it was very clear to me that the president himself out publicly on a number of occasions ... and people were digging a pretty deep hole, without me helping them, in advancing -LRB- the cover -RRB- story.

 Few visible scars remain from `` Terrible Tuesday,'' the day 10 years ago when a tornado tore an eight-mile path of destruction, but residents will never forget the deadly twister. The April 10, 1979, tornado killed 46 people, injured 1,700 and left 20,000 homeless. It demolished more than 2,566 houses, 1,100 apartments, 81 businesses, several schools and churches and left the city without water and, in some parts of town, electricity. The tornado, which stayed on the ground 47 minutes, caused an estimated $ 300 million in damages. The asbestos-sided homes destroyed by the storm have been replaced with sturdier, brick-front dwellings, just one sign of the city's recovery. But ask anyone who lived here then; it was terrifying. `` This reminds me every day of that cyclone,'' said 80-year-old <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Groves </PERSON>, pulling up his left pant leg to display a swollen knee. Groves has scars like hash marks across his bald head, reminders of the flying glass and wood that hit him as he tried to escape the storm's fury. He remembers lying on top of his terrified wife in his bathroom while the twister screamed overhead. `` That thing just bounced me up and down,'' Groves said. His knee has been sore ever since. The twister turned their house in the <LOCATION> Faith </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> subdivision into debris. Groves and his wife, <PERSON> Merle </PERSON>, had lived in the home since 1953. `` All that was left standing of this house was the bathtub, the hot water heater and the commode,'' Groves said. `` We just had blocks and blocks of total devastation,'' said <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> city spokeswoman <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Crane </PERSON>. `` We figured it would take about 10 years to get it all back.'' In fact, 80 percent of the lost buildings were replaced within a year. Today, virtually every structure that was destroyed has been rebuilt in this town of 98,900, which is about 140 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, near the <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> border. `` That part of the city has grown tremendously since the tornado,'' Ms. <PERSON> Crane </PERSON> said. Many of the homes, schools, churches and businesses were rebuilt with assistance from the federal government and a $ 14 million bond issue. That effort won <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> the `` <LOCATION> All-America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'' designation in 1980. `` There's been a lot of good come out of the tornado,'' said <PERSON> Merle </PERSON> <PERSON> Pedigo </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> chaplain who helped organize rebuilding efforts. `` Lots of people's homes were rebuilt.'' Churches helped many residents like the Groves. Six months after the tragedy, a group of Mennonites from as far away as <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> started rebuilding the Groves' home. Groves supplied the materials and used a $ 12,000 loan from the <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to replace appliances, furniture and other items lost in the storm. Their three-bedroom house now has a red-brick facade instead of its old asbestos siding. `` We had to get everything new, but this house is built strong now,'' he said. Others on his devastated street began rebuilding as well, including <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Milam </PERSON> <PERSON> Elementary </PERSON>, where a storm-tossed <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> remained embedded in a classroom wall for weeks after the tornado. Behind the new bricks and mortar of <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, residents keep various mementos of the storm. For the Groves, one reminder comes once a month in the mail: the payment notice for their <ORGANIZATION> SBA </ORGANIZATION> rebuilding loan, on which they still owe more than $ 5,000. And in his garage, Groves still stores his old refrigerator, which he found in the school yard across the street after the twister passed, and a 1965 GMC pickup dented during the storm. `` I keep them as souvenirs,'' he said.

 Crews tackling the worst oil spill in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history got good news from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on who's in charge of the cleanup and bad news from a weather forecast that could put untainted shoreline in jeopardy. Only 7 percent of the 10.1 million gallons of oil has been retrieved. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced Friday he was sending military troops to help clean up the oil that leaked from tanker Exxon Valdez on March 24. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> was taking control of the operation, ending days of bickering and weeks of frustration over the oil company's efforts. `` I think we had a problem with organization _ that's what frustrated everybody,'' said Rear Adm. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Alaskan </LOCATION> district who now heads the cleanup operation. `` We now see a clean line of what's going to go on.'' Under the new plan, reached by compromise at the request of Alaskan officials, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> will have final responsibility for running the cleanup effort. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> will continue to provide the materials and manpower and will not be relieved of liability. `` We'll be directing the strategic application of forces. ... Exxon retains the role of support,'' said <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>. The change in command came as weather forecasters warned of a change in the winds that have pushed nearly half the oil south and out of the environmentally sensitive Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> in the two weeks since the tanker ran aground on <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION>. The shift in direction threatens to push oil slicks, which have already traveled over a 3,000-square-mile area in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, toward <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and the fragile bays and inlets of the <LOCATION> Kenai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. So far, only an estimated 16,000 barrels of oil have been sopped and vacuumed up from the once-clear water of Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. The spill has killed thousands of birds and sea otters along the central Alaskan coast, cost fishermen millions of dollars in lost catch and continues to threaten valuable salmon fisheries. A shift in the wind `` could easily double the area affected,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>, coordinator of the state's cleanup effort. A large oil slick continued to threaten the edges of Kenai Fjords National Park, a remote refuge 100 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, as workers set up floating oil booms to protected against the expected onslaught. `` We're preparing for the worse case,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinley </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` Even if this does n't foul the beaches this stuff could be there for a long time. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at a news conference in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that he was directing <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> to make military forces and equipment available. He also directed <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> to coordinate the effort. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had been under pressure from members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and Alaskan officials to intervene. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> on Wednesday asked the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to take over management of the cleanup from <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>. The president insisted, however, `` We are not federalizing this operation,'' and that `` this should not relieve <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> from any of its responsibilities or liabilities.'' State officials said they were pleased with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision but worried that the use of military troops in the cleaup might disrupt the effort and deny jobs to state residents. But <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said he did n't anticipate the wholesale use of troops. `` We have a plan and we want to proceed rather cautiously,'' he said. `` What we're really going to do is have local hire.'' <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said he was pleased with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s action, although he agrees that Alaskans should get available work before the military. `` It appears the president is meeting the objectives we had in asking the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to take over the spill cleanup in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>,'' he said.

 A nuclear-powered Soviet submarine sank more than 300 miles off the coast of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> after suffering an underwater accident and catching fire, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Norwegian officials said Friday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said there were `` definitely'' casualties on board the stricken submarine, but declined to estimate how many. The Soviet Embassy in <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> confirmed the sinking but provided no details, according to a Norwegian Radio report on Saturday. There was no other word on the accident out of the government in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> or from the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday night that <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> sources said as many as a dozen were killed in the fire, while others were rescued by sister Soviet ships that rushed to the scene. The submarine is believed to carry a crew of 95, according to the authoritative reference book, `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s Fighting Ships.'' Officials told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that the submarine managed to surface for a time in the Norwegian Sea after the accident occurred and that at least one Soviet ship had responded to a distress call and arrived on scene. `` It was on the surface, but now it appears it's gone,'' said one official, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` We're trying to get confirmation, but we believe it sunk.'' Norwegian Defense Minister <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> Joergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Holst </PERSON> was quoted on the West German government radio as saying that pilots of reconnaissance planes reported seeing bodies at the site. In addition, the radio reported that <PERSON> Holst </PERSON> believes the submarine broke in two as it sank and that the Soviets turned down Norwegian offers of help. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the accident appeared to involve a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> `` Mike'' submarine _ one of the <ORGANIZATION> Russian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s newer attack subs designed to hunt and destroy other submarines in the event of war. `` There are indications there was a major fire aboard, but we have no details. We understand there has been a loss of life but we ca n't confirm how many,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` We express the sympathy of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> government for any loss of life involved.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had been notified of the accident, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. One <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> source placed the last known position of the vessel about 310 miles to the north of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION>. Another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said it was not known what caused the problem, precisely when the accident occurred or whether the nuclear propulsion section of the craft was involved. A nuclear specialist at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> think-tank called the technology used in the <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> sub `` inherently very dangerous'' and said that if the reactor had been involved, `` it could be quite catastrophic.'' In <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>, a Norwegian army supreme command spokesman said the sub apparently was lost in the area between <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION>. Col. <PERSON> Gollow </PERSON> <PERSON> Gjeseth </PERSON>, press spokesman of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview that a Norwegian observation plane sent over the area about 11 EDT saw `` a Soviet ship and two rubber boats.'' <ORGANIZATION> NTB </ORGANIZATION>, the national news agency, said the plane saw several Soviet planes and vessels in the area, apparently part of a Soviet rescue operation in the area, which is in international waters. The agency said people had been sighted in at least one of the rubber boats, but it was not clear if the boats were from the submarine or from one of the surface vessels. The biggest surface ship in the area was a Soviet refrigerator trawler, the <ORGANIZATION> NTB </ORGANIZATION> report said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources offered no indication as to what the submarine might have been doing at the time of the accident. They said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had no warships in the area and had not received any request from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for assistance. The sources declined to say when or how the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> first became aware of the submarine's problems. But <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported that <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> sources said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence learned of the accident through electronic intercepts of communications from the stricken submarine. According to `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s Fighting Ships,'' the Soviets have so far launched only one ship in the `` Mike'' class. That vessel was launched in May 1983 and went into service in late 1984, according to <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s. The Pentagon reference book `` Soviet Military Power'' says the <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> vessel was n't declared operational until 1986. The proper Russian name for the submarine was not immediately available. The name `` Mike'' is a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nickname for the sub. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s describes the <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> submarine's two nuclear reactors as `` probably liquid metal cooled,'' an approach that `` allows for a saving in space as well as an increase in power.'' The sources stressed, however, it was unclear whether the nuclear propulsion section of the Russian sub had been the source of the accident or involved in any fires. The <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> submarine is described as being about 361 feet long and capable of steaming at 38 knots when submerged. The sub displaces about 6,400 tons when submerged. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s and other <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> reference books describe the <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> as a submarine that `` seems to be a test vehicle for new design and propulsion features.'' Administration sources said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies have long assumed the <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> sub was built to serve as a `` test platform'' for new types of submarine-launched cruise missiles. The accident with the <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> comes 2 -LCB- years after a Soviet `` Yankee-class'' missile submarine sank off the coast of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> after an explosion and fire. That fire was believed to have involved the liquid fuel propellant inside a nuclear missile. That incident was just the latest in a string of accidents over the years involving Soviet submarines and nuclear-powered vessels. According to <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Arkin </PERSON>, a specialist on nuclear weaponry with the liberal think tank <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> navy has suffered more than 200 serious accidents with submarines just since 1975. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials have long asserted the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> navy does not attach as much importance to the safety of their nuclear operations as do Western navies. While stressing he had no idea whether the <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> submarine's nuclear reactor had been involved in the accident, <PERSON> Arkin </PERSON> said that particular technology was `` inherently very dangerous. `` This sub carries two liquid metal cooled reactors; you are literally using molten metal, probably sodium,'' <PERSON> Arkin </PERSON> said. `` It is a more efficient means of propulsion than using steam water, but it is very dangerous and very difficult to operate. We tried it once and gave up because we considered it too volatile. So if it was a reactor incident, it could be quite catastrophic.''

 Elementary school principal <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> may hedge his bets in the future. He lost a wager with the <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION>'s 275 students that they could not collectively read 1 million pages of books or magazine articles by April 21. His penalty: a day on the school roof. Hall set up a desk with a telephone on the roof Friday and received notes and messages by rope and bucket under cloudy skies and in temperatures in the 40s. He had several visitors; many carried cameras. The students, monitored by teachers and parents, made good on the bet by Feb. 27. On the average, each student read about 4,500 pages, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said.

 Southern Californians could get some relief today from a record heat wave, while <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> residents scramble to protect their homes against what's expected to be some of the worst flooding this century. In the East, folks bundled up for damp or snowy weather today. A fourth day of record <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> heat shut down a hospital emergency room Friday and trapped smog in the valleys. <LOCATION> Downtown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> had a high of 100 degrees, breaking the date's record of 88 set in 1904 and tied in 1962. The city reached a record-tying 100 on Tuesday and had record highs of 105 Wednesday and 106 Thursday. In <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, property owners stood in line at emergency management offices to buy sandbags to protect their homes from <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> flooding. `` We just ca n't keep up,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Grondahl </PERSON>, an emergency services director in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. `` We went through another 11,000 -LRB- bags -RRB- this morning and I've got more on order.'' In the East, springtime snows were expected in the northern and central Appalachians as well as parts of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> today, though little accumulation was forecast. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> weather pattern, which began with warm winds last weekend and pushed highs into triple digits Tuesday, was dissipating, and a cooling trend was expected today, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> forecasters said. Still, the heat maintained a sweltering presence Friday. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> topped out at 93 _ 8 degrees above the 1962 record and 25 degrees above normal. In northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, records continued to melt away, too. <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> recorded the high for the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area with 94 degrees, breaking the previous high for the date of 88 set in 1899. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> came in with 93 degrees, to beat a 1934 record of 84. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s high of 92 degrees broke the previous record of 81 set in 1939 and set an all-time high for the month of April. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> was forced to shut its emergency rooms after a 20-minute fire Thursday night knocked out the air conditioning. The blaze in two rooftop air conditioning cooling towers caused no injuries or evacuations. The cooling system was repaired and was expected to be cooling off patient wards today, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON>. Elsewhere, thousands sought relief at the beaches, but they had to cross hot-as-griddle sands to reach the ocean. Lifeguard <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> DeGregori </PERSON>, watching over some of the 60,000 people crowded near the water on <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, figured the sand was 10 or 15 degrees hotter than the air. First-stage smog alerts were issued for part of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gabriel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and to the west in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> area. The alerts mean pollutants were at levels unhealthful for everyone. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinner </PERSON> asked the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to allow using up to $ 1.5 million in profits from a state-run bank to help the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> rebuild after rampant flooding. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Friday amended Sinner's request into the budget. In <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved a $ 250,000 appropriation to provide emergency flood assistance for the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. The Red River forms the boundary between <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. The 533-mile river flows north into <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Winnipeg </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Runoff from the winter's heavy snowfall sent the river and two adjoining rivers over their banks earlier this week in the communities of <LOCATION> Breckenridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Wahpeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, forcing the evacuation of scores of residents and damaging hundreds of homes. The river had risen to a level of more than 32 feet Friday and was expected to crest at 36 -LCB- feet late Sunday or Monday, which would be the second-worst flood this century in the cities. The river rose to 37.3 feet during a 1969 flood. Flood stage is 17 feet. `` I've lived here a long time and I've never seen it like this,'' <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wahpeton </LOCATION> said as he surveyed a submerged city park across the street from his home. `` This is something that comes along only once in a lifetime.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the operator of the trans-Alaska oil-pipeline terminal could face fines exceeding $ 700 million as a result of the nation's worst oil spill, a review of state and federal law indicates. State attorneys have been monitoring the spill cleanup in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> and collecting evidence of damages since the tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> ran aground March 24, said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Mertz </PERSON>, an assistant state attorney general. More than 10 million gallons of crude oil leaked from the tanker, killing fish, marine mammals, birds and other wildlife over a 3,000-square-mile area, and affecting the livelihoods of fishermen and others who live in the region. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> are the two companies that likely will bear the brunt of the state and federal governments' legal attack. `` They're certainly the principal players,'' <PERSON> Mertz </PERSON> said Friday. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> owns the tanker through a corporate division, and also owns the oil. <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION>, a consortium of seven oil companies, owns and operates the pipeline terminal where the tanker took on its load of oil. Both companies were responsible for the initial spill response, which has been attacked by government officials and environmentalists as slow and ineffective. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s legal ammunition includes several laws that provide for hefty fines against companies responsible for polluting the environment. For large spills, the state can assess a $ 1 - to $ 10-per-gallon civil fine regardless of fault It is automatically multiplied by five in cases of `` gross negligence'' or when spill damages increase because of poor cleanup response, <PERSON> Mertz </PERSON> said. A complex formula determines the fine, based on how damaging the spill is to the environment. <PERSON> Mertz </PERSON> said the maximum civil fine for spills in a marine environment such as Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> is $ 2.50 a gallon. The $ 10-a-gallon fine applies only to serious damage in freshwater, fish-bearing streams. However, it is possible the top fine could apply to the Exxon Valdez spill. The state would have to prove the oil had damaged any of the dozens of freshwater streams that feed the sound, <PERSON> Mertz </PERSON> said. If the maximum fine and the `` automatic multiplier'' were applied, the oil companies could be assessed more than $ 500 million. The fine would be spread among the liable parties, <PERSON> Mertz </PERSON> said. The state also can seek compensation for damages to natural resources, including those damages that can not be measured, and for the state's costs of containment and cleanup, he said. Another state law allows for a civil fine of up to $ 100,000, and the state can seek additional damages under federal environmental laws. It also is possible the state will seek to recover lost oil-royalty income, <PERSON> Mertz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mertz </PERSON> declined to speculate how high the state fines could total, noting the issue could be appealed in court. `` I would not even come close to hazarding a guess,'' he said. `` The totality of natural resource damages is so difficult to compute. It can be done but it requires a lot of expertise and takes a lot of time.'' <PERSON> Mertz </PERSON> estimated it could take six to 12 years to resolve the liability issues and fines in court. `` Spills of this magnitude take years and years to get to trial. It's just impossible to predict what way it will go,'' he said. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Prezyna </PERSON>, an attorney with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, said most federal fines would arise from violations of the Clean Water Act.

 A former live-in maid has been charged with stealing more than $ 880,000 from a paraplegic widow while keeping the elderly woman a prisoner in her own home. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, 54, confined <PERSON> Valeria </PERSON> <PERSON> Lust </PERSON> to her <LOCATION> Lakeland </LOCATION> home by giving her incapacitating drugs and taking away the 71-year-old woman's walker and telephone, according to court documents. While living with the widow for a year until January 1988, Ms. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> forged her name on 20 checks worth $ 883,534 and gave some of the money to a North Carolina-based television ministry, according to an affidavit filed Thursday. In a separate civil case, Mrs. Lust claims more than $ 700,000 of her money went to the <ORGANIZATION> Fountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> ministry. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittington </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Fountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION>, confirmed the ministry received about $ 700,000 from Mrs. Lust, and said the money was a donation. Ms. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, who was arrested Thursday, was charged with 20 counts of grand theft, 21 counts of forgery, 20 counts of uttering a forged instrument and false imprisonment. She was ordered held in the <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> in lieu of $ 500,000 bail. In June, Mrs. Lust's attorneys sued the ministry, claiming Ms. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> used undue influence to get her to donate more than $ 700,000, court records state. Although $ 711,941 allegedly was deposited in a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> account set up in the names of Ms. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> and Mrs. Lust, the widow told authorities she knew of no such account. The civil lawsuit between Mrs. Lust and Fountain of Life is pending. No criminal trial date has been set. Melonie Milling, Ms. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' 27-year-old daughter, also lived in Mrs. Lust's home, investigators said. Ms. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> illegally obtained prescription drugs and gave them to Mrs. Lust to keep her sleepy so she would not complain, Ms. <PERSON> Milling </PERSON> told authorities. Ms. Milling also said her mother disconnected the telephone in the woman's bedroom and told her: `` See, no one cares, no one calls; your children do n't even call.'' Mrs. Lust, a paraplegic since suffering a stroke in 1982, also has impaired vision as a result of unsuccessful cataract surgery.

 Navajo police enforced a court order barring embattled Chairman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> from his offices at the nation's largest <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> tribe, and minor violence marred an anti-MacDonald rally. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> did not show up for work Friday, and his staff was out of the administration building by the time the tribal officers closed the offices. About 750 people turned up for a demonstration stemming from the <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s 49-13 vote on Feb. 17 to place <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> and Vice Chairman <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> on administrative leave. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, who has been accused in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Senate testimony of receiving gifts and kickbacks in connection with tribal business dealings, had offered to step down temporarily but recanted when the tribe refused to pay his anticipated defense costs. Tribal business conducted since <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> was re-elected in 1986 reportedly is the subject of a probe by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> publicly has denied any wrongdoing, but he has refused to discuss the allegations against him with reporters.

<HEAD>Bus Hijacker Wanted Syria Out Of Lebanon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An armed man who hijacked a New York-bound Greyhound bus and held its driver and 10 passengers hostage was demanding reduced Syrian involvement in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, police say. The hijacking ended peacefully on <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> and without injuries when the last five hostages were freed Friday evening, eight hours after the ordeal started in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. Before surrendering, the hijacker _ who claimed to be holding dynamite _ held police at bay for five hours after the bus veered onto the muddy lawn at the center of Canadian government. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Yacoub </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, was identified as the man who took over the bus as it left that city. Police said he was demanding action on behalf of the Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION>, a group that authorities are n't even sure exists. Private CTV television quoted security sources as saying the gunman was demanding that Syrian troops withdraw from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and free all the prisoners they hold. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> sent troops into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as a peacekeeping force after the civil war between Lebanese Moslems and Christians erupted in 1975. <PERSON> Gilles </PERSON> <PERSON> Favreau </PERSON>, assistant commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mounted </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, did not say what charges would be filed against <PERSON> Yacoub </PERSON>. He also could not explain why the police did not know the bus was heading for Parliament until its arrival, which raised questions about security in the area. `` You've got to realize that this bus was going to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Favreau </PERSON> said at a news conference. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, deputy commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> Mounties </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Yacoub </PERSON> emigrated to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1976. The hijacker released the first hostage, an elderly man, at the <LOCATION> Champlain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> just outside of <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> before heading on to <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>, 100 miles to the west. Three female hostages and one man were released gradually at <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>, and the male driver left the vehicle just before the hijacking came to an end. Police briefly checked the final five hostages before concluding they were not involved with the hijacker. The hijacker had claimed to have explosives, but none were found. Witnesses said they heard at least three shots, and they believed all were fired by the hijacker as police rushed to the site where the bus was stuck on the lawn in front of the House of Commons. The red, white and blue bus sat the extensive lawn of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> surrounded by police hiding behind their vehicles or nearby walls. A police van stopped behind the bus at midafternoon, and officers jumped out and crouched behind the van's doors. Traffic was blocked off and and people cleared from the area, including pedestrians at the front of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, across the street from the House of Commons. stopped. Forty embassy employees took a difficult route out of the building, dismantling a window in the building next door and crawling out.

 Zoologists at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Malaya </ORGANIZATION> said today they have found a frog that grows out of an egg instead of going through the tadpole stage in water. Zoology professor <PERSON> Yong </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> said he and a team of colleagues discovered a tree frog, philautus aurifasciatus, which can breed on land without water, while on a jungle expedition last February in the <LOCATION> Genting </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highlands </LOCATION> area about 20 miles east of <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION>. He said the eggs were found on a pitcher plant, and were the first time such a frog had been found in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. Most frogs lay eggs in water that become tadpoles, which mature into frogs and leave the water. <PERSON> Yong </PERSON> said the tree frog the zoologists discovered lays its eggs on land and that the eggs hatch frogs. He said news of the discovery was withheld to carry out breeding and tests. The frog is one of 17 species found on Malaysian trees. There are 70 species of frogs in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. The philautus aurifasciatus also has been found in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and are known to exist in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Yong </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Study Links Low Cholesterol in Some Men to Greater Cancer Risk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new medical study says a low-fat diet may not be healthy for everyone and that a 12-year survey shows low cholesterol levels coincide with an increased risk of cancer in some men. The researchers reported in the weekly <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, published Friday, that their results also show people with high cholesterol have a greater chance of getting heart disease. That finding has been confirmed by other scientific teams and gained widespread public acceptance. However, the latest team of researchers said their results also show that low cholesterol levels sometimes coincide with a greater risk from cancer, although this link was only significant for men. They said they could not explain why these people are more at risk from cancer. They said the lower cholesterol itself could be the culprit, but that something else may be the cause instead. The study is not the first to find a link between lower cholesterol and higher cancer risk. Some researchers have suggested lower cholesterol levels are in fact the product of undiagnosed bowel cancers, because developing tumors trap cholesterol and remove it from blood. While the issue remains unsettled, many other scientists doubt high cholesterol levels help prevent cancer. The report said the survey was conducted among 15,262 people _ 7,000 men and 8,262 women aged 45 to 64 in industrial southwestern <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. The scientists said they found the most convincing link for lung cancer. `` The inverse association between cholesterol concentration and cancer in men was strongest for lung cancer.'' The research team was comprised <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawthorne </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON>; <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Isles </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lever </PERSON>, both of the blood pressure unit at the Western Infirmary at <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION> in southwest <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillis </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hole </PERSON>, both of the cancer surveillance unit at <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ruchill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. The team said more research is needed in the area. But, it added, `` We conclude that it may be a mistake to assume that dietary advice given to the general population to reduce the intake of saturated fat will necessarily reduce overall mortality.'' Low-fat diets help reduce cholesterol. The team said such diets are probably a good idea for people with high cholesterol levels. Their advice, however, was contradicted by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, director of the London-based <ORGANIZATION> Coronary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>: <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> domestic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> news </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in an interview: `` I do not believe this single research study provides a proper basis on which to change well-established medical advice to eat less saturated fat.'' He said a 1,300-page study by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, released last month, showed there is no relationship between low cholesterol and cancer. `` Our advice would be that people should eat less saturated fat if they want to live longer.'' <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> microbiologist <PERSON> Selwyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Broitman </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>'s science writers' seminar in <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, on Tuesday that he has found bowel cancer can lower cholesterol in rats. A long-term study of residents of <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, revealed some people have low levels of cholesterol and an above-average risk of colon cancer, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>'s senior vice president for research. But he said studies of entire populations in several nations show that people who eat high-fat, high-cholesterol diets tend to have a higher incidence of both heart disease and colon cancer.

 Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> early today that the risk of explosion or contamination from a Soviet sub that sank off <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> was `` negligible,'' her office said. The Soviet leader also assured Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> that the reactors on the nuclear-powered submarine had been shut down before the vessel caught fire and sank 312 miles off northern <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, the prime minister's office said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> sent the message by telephone from his private office in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> a few hours after he returned to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> from a two-day visit to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> where he held wide-ranging talks with Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, her office said.

The Soviet leader told Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> that there had been loss of life but gave no figures, Downing Street said.

In response, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s office said it conveyed to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` her condolences and sympathy for the families of those who lost their lives in the accident.'' The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> said today that the submarine sank in international waters 110 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Bear </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Investigators Say Missed Communication May Have Led To Train Wreck</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EMPORIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Silver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>'s engineer was not told that his train was about to switch tracks when he barreled into the switching area at about 60 mph, investigators said. `` There definitely was a misunderstanding about when the train was to switch tracks,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> regional office in <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, S.C. He said the company trainmaster at the switching area radioed <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> central dispatch in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, that the train should switch back to the northbound tracks at the <LOCATION> Trego </LOCATION> switching area. The dispatcher in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> agreed to the move, and the trainmaster manually threw the switch to divert the train to the northbound tracks. Andrea Just of <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> office said tape recordings show the dispatcher never notified the engineer that he was going to be switching tracks at <LOCATION> Trego </LOCATION>. The derailment Thursday sent 34 people to area hospitals. The wreck caused about $ 1.8 million in damage to the train and track. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Inglis </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s chief inspector, said it could be days before officials find out the exact cause of the accident Federal authorities said all crew members have been tested for drug and alcohol use, but results were not immediately available. The Silver Star, carrying 519 passengers, was traveling north Thursday when it was switched to a southbound track because work was being done on the northbound track. Both train engines and six of the train's 18 cars left the track at the switching area. Of the 34 who had minor injuries, 33 were passengers. <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the injuries included sore necks and backs, and minor cuts. He said the track was reopened Friday and trains were back on normal schedule.

<TEXT>
 Five bombs believed to have been planted by Basque separatists exploded early today at a railroad line, officials said. The attacks follow a three-month truce and could signal a new round of Basque violence. The explosives went off at two points at the railway in the northern <LOCATION> Navarre </LOCATION> region, damaging tracks and a power substation, officials said. No injuries were reported. Two hours before the predawn blasts, a man telephoned a local travelers' aid bureau and said the Basque separatist organization, known by its Basque initials <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION>, had placed several bombs on the rail line that were to explode within a few hours, the civil governor's office said. The bombings represent the first attacks linked to <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> since Jan. 8, when the group called a halt to attacks in exchange for peace talks with the government. The group wants independence for the three-province northern Basque region, but the government says it will only talk when <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> ceases fighting. <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> broke off its talks with <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, earlier this week, claiming the government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> had reneged on terms for more talks and a prolonged halt on anti-government attacks. Also today, police were investigating a mail bomb that exploded Friday in an apartment in the northern Basque town of <LOCATION> Irun </LOCATION>, seriously injuring a 27-year-old man. No group immediately claimed responsibility. Authorities said they had not ruled out the possibility that <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> was behind it. Since beginning its 21-year campaign for Basque self-determination, <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600 people, mainly police, military and Civil Guard officers.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION> has refused to give a more than 150-year-old relic to a Cree Indian who ran 2,700 miles in his quest to retrieve the sacred object for his people. Museum spokesman <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurz </PERSON> said Friday that the museum sent a letter to <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thunder </PERSON>'s home in <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, notifying him of the museum's decision. <PERSON> Thunder </PERSON> said he was a great-great-grandson, through adoption, of Chief Big Bear, the <LOCATION> Cree </LOCATION> leader who created the artifact _ a sacred calico-wrapped bundle holding bear claws, sweet grass and a plug of tobacco. It was meant to give his people spiritual strength and guidance. Thunder said Big Bear told him ten years ago, through dreams and visions, to retrieve the bundle and take it to his tribe in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> where it would be used in prayers and sacred Indian ceremonies. Told of the museum's refusal to give him the bundle, <PERSON> Thunder </PERSON> said: `` I had been anticipating this.'' He declined to say if he would continue efforts to retrieve the artifact. Thunder, 38, arrived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> March 21 after a run across <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, beginning in <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION> Sept. 1, to draw attention to his mission. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, he met with museum officials and formally requested that the Cree artifact be returned. Big Bear made the bundle when he was about 13 years old and later wore it into battle for protection and guidance. A son of Big Bear _ <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Pimi </PERSON>, who was also known as Horse Child _ sought out a museum anthropologist who was leading an expedition into central <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and on Sept. 10, 1934, presented it to the museum for safekeeping, the museum said. Since then, it has been available only to researchers, scholars and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>. It has never been on public display. In rejecting Thunder's claim, <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A </ORGANIZATION>. Freed, a museum curator who met with <PERSON> Thunder </PERSON>, wrote in his letter to Thunder `` it is our responsibility to honor -LRB- <PERSON> Pimi </PERSON>'s -RRB- wish.''

 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> gathered for emergency talks today in a bid to halt the fighting jeopardizing <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s independence plan, which one official described as all but suspended. Officials from the three nations, along with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet observers, planned daylong talks at an undisclosed site north of <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION>. Battles between the South African-led security forces and black nationalist guerrillas occurred for an eighth straight day today, police said. At least 262 guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and 28 members of the security forces have been killed in the heaviest fighting of the territory's 23-year war, police said <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> officials outside <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> have disputed the figures and say many civilians also have been killed. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> called on the guerrillas to surrender by midday today or face intensified security-force action, but there was `` no indication whatsoever'' that <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> planned to lay down arms as the deadline passed, police Chief Inspector <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Brune </PERSON> said. The South African-installed administrator of the territory, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON>, said Friday there was a `` de facto suspension'' of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> independence plan because of the widespread fighting near <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s northern border with <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. He said elections planned for November could be affected by the conflict. <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, said he had informed <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> about a South African decision to activate an unspecified number of additional soldiers. A major reason for the move, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said, was that some guerrillas of the <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> People's Organization were approaching areas where white farmers lived. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has allowed <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to move a limited number of army troops from their bases to support anti-guerrilla police units, but <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said Friday that the security forces `` at the present level are not able to stem the incursion.'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> emphasized that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> remained committed to implementing independence in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and that the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan had not been formally suspended. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it was satisfied that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> still sought to grant independence to the territory it has ruled since World War I. After six months of an informal cease-fire, the fighting began April 1, the day the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> independence plan and a formal cease-fire took effect. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> claims <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> has sent more than 1,900 guerrillas into northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> since April 1 in violation of an accord requiring the insurgents to remain at bases at least 100 miles away in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Col. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Plessis </PERSON>, a territorial army officer, said an additional 1,300 guerrillas were in southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> near the Namibian border and were `` an immediate threat.'' <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> leaders contend most of the guerrillas had been in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> for some time and have no intention of leaving for <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Some <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials have suggested that <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> field commanders mistakenly thought their units could return unmolested to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> as of April 1 and set up bases. Several captured guerrillas have said they returned to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> in search of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> personnel and expected no confrontations with the security forces. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> has authorized 4,650 troops for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, but less than 1,000 have arrived. Of that total, the only forces in the northern battle areas as of Saturday were about 300 logistical personnel. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> has been favored to win the most votes in pre-independence elections planned for November under the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan. The way for Namibian independence was cleared in December when <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> signed an accord calling for withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops who have helped Marxist <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> battle U.S.-backed rebels.

More than 100 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, created in December by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> to serve as a policy council to Solidarity, squeezed around tables laden with sandwiches and cakes in a musty church basement. `` Thanking you for our common great political and public victory, let me ask you to make use of this victory so we can choose together some way of putting freedom into practice so there will be real effects,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. The Sejm, or parliament, passed bills Friday that enacted economic and political agreements approved by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and the interior minister, Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, after two months of talks between authorities and the opposition. The laws allow restoration of Solidarity, which was banned after the December 1981 martial law crackdown, give <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> its first free elections since World War II, and create the post of presidency. The new parliament will consist of two chambers: a newly created 100-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and a 460 member Sejm. Elections to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will be freely contested while the <ORGANIZATION> communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> and its allies will be assured 65 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> with 35 percent reserved for independent, non-party candidates. `` We should try to win in the elections to the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, win on the social side because it would be very bad if we retreated from the field and were unable to cultivate those limited possibilities,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. He said the Citizens Committee should be formalized so that it could ask future opposition legislators to speak on behalf of Solidarity. The meeting was also expected to consider potential opposition candidates for the elections scheduled for June. In the past, Solidarity urged election boycotts to express disapproval of authorities' policies. The boycott appeals and public dissatisfication led to increasingly low voter turnouts and finally to the devastating rejection of a government referendum on economic reform in November 1987. The opposition agreed to participate in elections during the round-table talks in exchange for the restoration of Solidarity's legal status While the opposition will field candidates for parliament, it has expressed reluctance to enter the government where the Polish <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- communist -RRB- Party and its allies still would have a majority of ministers. Authorities first proposed talks with the opposition on political and economic reform during the second nationwide wave of strikes in August. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> refused talks until authorities agreed to accept a legal Solidarity. The go-ahead came when the communist party approved Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s recommendation to restore Solidarity at a party plenum in January.

 An <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Democrat will file a formal complaint next week that <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republican Whip <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> allegedly violated nine <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules. Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> circulated the complaint he drew up among his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> colleagues on Friday, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. Under House rules, the formal filing of such a complaint by <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> will force the ethics committee to take a vote on whether to launch an investigation of <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Republican. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s action was seen as the beginning of a Democratic counteroffensive against <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, who last year filed the ethics complaint that resulted in a lengthy investigation of Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>.

Allegations in <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s complaint center on an unusual promotional deal for <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s 1984 book, `` Window of Opportunity.'' The deal involved 21 investors who put $ 5,000 each into a partnership formed to promote the book. In return for their investment, the partners were promised half the publisher's profits, but the publisher ended up losing money on the book and the investors got a tax writeoff

 A nuclear-powered Soviet submarine caught fire and sank in international waters off northern <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> officials said today that at least 12 crew members were killed. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> sent messages to the prime ministers of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> saying that an undetermined number of sailors died in the accident Friday and that the nuclear reactors on the submarine had been shut down before the vessel sank, officials and news reports said. `` According to the opinion of experts, the possibility of a nuclear explosion and radioactive pollution of the environment is excluded,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s message to <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s premier said, according to the <ORGANIZATION> NTB </ORGANIZATION> news agency. Officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said it was probably a `` Mike'' class submarine, one of the most modern in the Soviet fleet, and capable of carrying 95 sailors. They said the sub, which was designed to hunt and destroy other submarines in the event of war, is powered by two nuclear generators and can carry torpedoes and long-range ballistic missiles. <PERSON> Vadime </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosanov </PERSON>, the Soviet press attache in <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>, told Norwegian television the sub was carrying torpedoes, not ballistic missiles. However, he declined to say whether the vessel was equipped with nuclear weapons. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Norwegian military sources, who reported the accident before Soviet officials did, said the fire apparently broke out while the vessel was underwater and that it surfaced before sinking. The official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, which reported the sinking 19 hours after it occurred, said: `` The crew is being rescued by Soviet vessels in the area. There has been loss of life.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, which did not identify the submarine, said only that `` a fire broke out on board a Soviet nuclear-powered torpedo submarine'' Friday at 11:41 a.m. -LRB- 3:41 a.m. EDT -RRB-, and it sank at 5:15 p.m. -LRB- 9:15 a.m. EDT -RRB-. `` Specialists ruled out the possibility of a radioactive contamination of the environment,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The Soviet defense minister, <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>, was quoted by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> as saying the crew fought the fire for several hours before abandoning ship. He said a Soviet warship was taking survivers to the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Murmansk </LOCATION>. Pictures taken Friday by Norwegian reconnaissance aircraft showed about 13 Soviet sailors clinging in the sea to a life raft thrown to them from the Norwegian aircraft. Norwegian officials said the sub sank 120 miles south of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bear </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and 320 miles off the northern coast of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. `` The minimum number of casualties would be 12. It's difficult to say and we do n't know many were picked up,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Per <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Ragdem </PERSON>, spokesman for <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s northern military command. He said the Soviets had declined offers of help from <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> confirmed in a message to Prime Minister <PERSON> Gro </PERSON> <PERSON> Harlem </PERSON> <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> that sailors died in the accident, but he did n't say how many, <ORGANIZATION> NTB </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who ended a 40-hour visit to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> on Friday, assured Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> that the sub's reactors had been shut down before the vessel caught fire and sank, her office said today If Western descriptions of the submarine are accurate, the reactors are well-protected and carry less radioactive material than in older submarines, said <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> Baarli </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radiation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> He said any radioactive material probably would remain in the submarine and not escape into the sea. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvik </PERSON>, chairman of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Peacetime Nuclear Accidents, said nearby waters would be checked for pollution. A Soviet cruiser of the `` Kirov'' class, equipped with hospital facilities, was at the site of the accident, as well as Soviet trawlers, <PERSON> Ragdem </PERSON> said. Norwegian coast guard vessels were also headed for the area, he said. Norwegian and Swedish defense sources estimate the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has about 110 nuclear submarines operating in northern waters from bases on the <LOCATION> Kola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, one of the world's heaviest concentrations of naval power. The `` Mike'' might carry 16 missiles for surface targets, although the figure is unconfirmed, said Swedish <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gur </PERSON>. Scores of crew members have been reported killed in previous Soviet submarine accidents. In 1983, a Soviet submarine sank in the northern <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, killing 90 crew members, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence officials.

<TEXT>
 More than 100 state and local officials using search dogs and a helicopter nabbed a fourth escapee early this morning, hours after 13 inmates broke out of an overcrowded county jail. Two inmates were captured late Friday after escaping from the <ORGANIZATION> Norfolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>, state police said. A third inmate was found today in the cellar of a home and a fourth was arrested near downtown Quincy. The inmates were discovered missing during a 9:30 p.m. head count and may have escaped about 8 p.m, state police Sgt. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said. Authorities believe they escaped by cutting through a jail wall. State troopers said they were concentrating their search for the remaining inmates in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Park </PERSON> sections of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> where many of the men are from. The inmates were clad in green prison garb. The <LOCATION> Dedham </LOCATION> jail is one of the most overcrowded prisons in the state. It was the scene of a disturbance in February when a fight among more than 100 inmates broke out in the recreation room and several small fires were set. At the time, there were 262 prisoners in the jail that was has a federally set limit of 172. The sheriff has received special permission that allows the extra prisoners at the jail. <LOCATION> Dedham </LOCATION> prison officials declined to say how many are in the jail now. `` Certainly the overcrowding is excessive,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> Marie-Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Kehoe </PERSON>, D-Dedham. She said the federal cap was the result of a lawsuit filed by inmates about four years ago. `` But please understand that originally, when the jail was constructed, it was built to accommodate 72,'' <PERSON> Kehoe </PERSON> said.

 The conversations begin tentatively, but the fears and frustrations of the past 11 years soon come tumbling out. It is the weariness that is most striking: weariness of war, weariness of a police state, weariness of what is perceived as the world's indifference to the superpower game being played in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` Other countries like to watch us Afghans, like we watch our dogfights, and think, ` Oh, the Afghans are killing each other again,'' said a <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> university professor who has studied in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> dogfights, which are a bit like canine wrestling matches, are seldom fatal. But the war between the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government, backed until earlier this year by Soviet troops, and Western-backed Moslem guerrillas has claimed an estimated 1 million lives since the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION> took power by coup and assassination in 1978. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has estimated at least 5 million Afghans have fled the country since then, leaving a population of about 10 million. `` People are dying and suffering every day,'' the professor said, speaking on condition he not be identified further. `` It is not human to just be an observer. `` The world is silent. We are silent. We have had to learn the science of being alive. I did not join the -LRB- communist -RRB- party. The politics of silence I was following.'' The professor spoke of the frustration of not being able to find out what was happening in his own country, what <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> might be contemplating, what fighting was going on in other parts of the country. `` We used to read the <ORGANIZATION> Far </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Monde </PERSON>. They come no more,'' he said. He said he distrusted the local government-controlled news media. Across town, a silver merchant also criticized what he considered the superpowers' abandonment of responsibility. `` The Americans, the <LOCATION> Russians </LOCATION> think they are finished. In <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, they make writings on paper. They say they finish this problem,'' he said. `` But this problem is not finished. It is worse, not better.'' Under a U.N.-sponsored accord signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> April 14, 1988, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> withdrew the last of its troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on Feb. 15 of this year. But <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> continues to arm its proteges, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says it can not abandon the guerrillas, who call themselves mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors. `` You give bombs to the mujahedeen,'' the silver merchant told an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> reporter. `` The Russians give bombs to the government. You do n't die. Russians do n't die. Only Afghan people die. Maybe it is time for us to say, ` OK, finished. President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> is not so bad. Let us have a quick finish.'' `` The people are weary, especially in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> when they hear of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>,'' said a 41-year-old man. His niece and her three children were killed last week while trying to leave <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, about 40 miles from the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border, where the guerrillas have besieged government troops for the past month. He said his relatives were traveling in an army-escorted convoy that was attacked by the mujahedeen. Others, too, were killed, he said, but he did not know the numbers. `` There are problems, because the main roads are going to be closed by the mujahedeen,'' he added. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> has already felt the effects of closed roads. Food and fuel supplies have been curtailed since January, as mujahedeen forces and snowfalls blocked highways. Although the situation has eased with airlifts of flour and wheat from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and weekly food and medicine flights from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, the poorest people of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> still spend hours getting bread from little bakery stalls dotted around the city. Some send their children in relays to await the crisp slabs of freshly baked nan, the bread that is the staple of the Afghan diet. Traffic on the streets of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> remains light, one-fourth or less of what it was last fall, because of gasoline rationing. `` The petrol pumps are open if you have the piece of paper from the government,'' said a shopkeeper who owns a car. `` If you want the paper, it may take three or four days. I would have to close my shop for three or four days. I have 10 children, and I must keep my shop open. I walk.''

 It was meant to be a week of celebration, a joyous confirmation that long-delayed independence finally was on its way. Instead, the bloodiest fighting of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s 23-year <PERSON> bush </PERSON> war erupted, making a mockery of a cease-fire, jeopardizing the credibility of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> monitoring operation, and killing scores of young guerrillas before they could savor the independence for which they fought. In the war-ravaged northern region of Ovambo, where most of the insurgents' supporters live, a dusk-to-dawn curfew is back in force after a seven-week lull, and deep-rooted cynicism about the prospects for independence from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has returned. `` Namibian soil now bleeds when in fact -LRB- the people -RRB- should be rejoicing,'' said the Namibian Council of Churches. There is agreement on what prompted the clashes _ the presence of hundreds of well-armed <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas in northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> on April 1, the day that the U.N.-supervised truce was to have taken effect. But why it happened _ after six months without major hostilities _ remains in dispute. Why would <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> risk confrontation on the very day that an 11-year-old independence plan was implemented, calling for elections which the guerrilla movement was favored to win? <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s ruler since World War I, says the guerrillas staged a cross-border incursion while they were supposed to have been at least 100 miles inside <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> as part of an agreement to confine combatants from both sides to their bases. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>'s aim, said South African Foriegn Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, was to set up bases after the cease-fire had neutralized security forces, and then proclaim to the world that the bases were established through military prowess. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>'s president, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON>, says most of the guerrillas involved in the fighting had been in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> all along and were prepared to place themselves under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> control on April 1. The insurgents thought they would be safe once the truce started and did not expect to be hunted down by military-style police units, other <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Villagers in Ovambo have recounted how cheerful <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas seemed to be expecting a hero's welcome rather than a war when they arrived. Officials from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and elsewhere have supported <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s assertion that the guerrillas did infiltrate from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> had no known bases in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Cedric </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornberry </PERSON>, second-in-command of the monitoring force, said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan made no provisions for such bases. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> boasted during the week that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s international image had been enhanced by the Namibian crisis, while <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> had been discredited. Even the Organization of African Unity and the front-line states of southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, two persistent critics of <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s government, refrained from attacking <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> when they issued statements of concern about <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. However, African nations expressed sympathy for <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> and accused the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> of incompetence. The leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> monitoring force have encountered particularly harsh criticism for allowing South African military units to leave their bases and join police in anti-guerrilla operations. The Namibian Council of Churches, in a report based on a visit by clergymen to the war zone, said that when Ovambo residents in the north tried to report incidents, two <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officers refused to stop reading their novels and a third `` was intoxicated and of no help at all.'' During the week of combat, less than 1,000 soldiers of the planned 4,650-member <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military monitoring force were in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, and only a handful of observers were in <LOCATION> Ovambo </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> and its Third World allies had insisted even this full figure was inadequate and called for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to expand the force to 7,500, as was originally planned. A major question now is whether any reconciliation can be achieved if the independence plan is able to proceed. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> had been favored to gain the most votes in pre-independence elections scheduled for November, and the fighting does not appear to have dampened its support in <LOCATION> Ovambo </LOCATION>, where about half of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s 1.3 million people live. But elsewhere, parties opposed to <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> hope to capitalize on what they view as a huge blunder by the guerrillas. Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turnhalle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, which depicts itself a moderate alternative to <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, said its supporters could be drawn into conflict with <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> backers because of the fighting in the north. <PERSON> Thornberry </PERSON>, at one of several hectic news briefings during the week, said <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> `` is in danger of bleeding to death.''

 Here are some facts and figures on the Soviet republic of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, where ethnic disputes and nationalist demonstrations prompted authorities to send in tanks and troops:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE LAND _ <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> is in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> in the southern <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. It is bordered by <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and at 27,000 square miles, it is smaller than <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. It includes the Abkhazian Autonomous Republic on the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> coast, the Ajar Autonomous Republic and the South Ossetian Autonomous Region.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE PEOPLE _ About 70 percent of the republic's 5.3 million people are Georgian. Among minority ethnic groups, 9 percent are Armenian, 7 percent Russian, 5 percent Azerbaijanis and 1.7 percent Abkhazian.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE ECONOMY _ <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> is a major resort area and the fruit and vegetable basket of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. There is also mining and industry.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 POLITICAL STATUS _ <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> is one of the 15 republics making up the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and activists are calling for secession. <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION> is an `` autonomous republic'' under the authority of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>; activists there want it to become a 16th republic of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 HISTORY _ <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> is one of the oldest nations in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, with records dating back to the 3rd century B.C. It became Christian in A.D. 318. It became a part of the Russian empire in 1800 to gain protection from the Persians. It became part of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1921. In 1956, dozens of people were killed when Soviet troops fired on a memorial march for the late dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, who was a Georgian. In April 1978 in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, about 5,000 people marched in protest of plans to drop Georgian as the state language of the republic. The plans were dropped.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> ABKHAZIA </LOCATION> _ The small subtropical resort area is located on the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> in northwest <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> on the border with the Russian republic. Abkhazians number just 15 percent or 91,000 of its total population of 505,000, and they are outnumbered by both Georgians and Russians in their homeland. Abkhazians have complained for years that Georgians have interfered with their national life, but Georgians complain of discrimination in <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION>. In 1978, 12,000 people gathered in village of <LOCATION> Lichni </LOCATION> to demand that <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION> be allowed to secede from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and join the Russian republic. The demand was refused, and the local party leader was dismissed.

<HEAD>Congress to Oil Industry: Be Prepared</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Government and industry were caught unprepared when the Exxon Valdez spilled 10 million gallons of crude oil into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is determined not to let it happen again. In response to the worst oil spill in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> history, lawmakers are scrutinizing federal statutes related to oil transportation so no future spill is allowed to get so far out of control. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, has introduced legislation that would require the president to immediately initiate a cleanup of oil spills unless he is sure the owner or operator of the vessel is doing it. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced Friday he was sending the military to <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> to help clean up, but <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> was angry that he waited until two weeks after the March 24 accident to take any action. `` A federal takeover of the cleanup effort was warranted after it became clear on the day of the accident that <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- the oil pipeline service company -RRB- and <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> had not responded in the manner called for by the contingency plan and did not have sufficient equipment available to contain the spill,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. His proposal would set up a $ 500 million federal fund to pay for the spills when those responsible ca n't be found. Both <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s bill and one offered by Sen. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., are amendments to the Clean Water Act <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON> is proposing that minimum penalties for spilling oil be increased from $ 5,000 to $ 50,000 and, in the case of big spills, to $ 50 per barrel. That would have slapped a multi-million dollar fine on <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> for the Valdez accident. House Republicans also are working on legislation to improve readiness for oil tanker accidents, but do n't want the federal government to get stuck with the bill. The measure being designed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> would require industry to be more specific about emergency response plans and have more equipment ready, as well as to pay for all the costs of cleanup. Legislation proposed by Rep. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, would consolidate four federal laws on who gets blamed and billed for damage caused by spills. His proposal also would increase liability, the categories for which compensation should be paid and the size of the fund for making compensation. Money for the fund would come from a 1.3-cent-per-barrel fee on crude oil sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' subcommittee on the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> will be working on legislation reauthorizing that service and likely will make changes reflecting reaction to the <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> disaster, said a staff member of the subcommittee. <PERSON> Cornel </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> noted that the bill could be a vehicle for strengthening rules against alcohol consumption by tanker crews, or requiring more extensive background checks on those renewing their pilot's licenses. The pilot of the <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>, who was in his cabin when the tanker ran aground, admitted drinking before the accident and, as a motorist, had a history of driving while intoxicated arrests. He has been charged in the accident. Both Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Conte </PERSON>, R-Mass., have introduced bills that would give the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> access to the Federal National Driver Register to check on driving records of potential tanker pilots Lawmakers opposed to oil exploration in the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> say there's not much chance of legislation passing that would allow drilling in that environmentally sensitive Alaskan region. `` ANWR is dead for the foreseeable future,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>, D-Colo. But Sen. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, D-La., who supports ANWR drilling, disagrees `` It is too early too tell what the impact will be,'' he said. `` We will have to assess not only what the damage is, but ways to prevent this kind of accident in the future and to assure the public that can be done. The spill does not reduce our need for oil.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget for fiscal 1990 assumed the treasury would get $ 2.1 billion from oil lease sales in the refuge. Since the <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> disaster, White House and congressional budget negotiators have decided the money wo n't be available.

 Tanks rumbled through thousands of people demonstrating for independence in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> today, and the republic's leaders discussed the crisis in a building besieged by protesters, activists said. `` They went right through the crowd,'' <PERSON> Tamara </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiza </PERSON>, correspondent for the unofficial journal Express-Khronika, said of the tanks. She said five or six tanks pushed through the demonstrators in downtown <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s capital, in a show of force on the fifth straight day of nationalists protests. She said the tanks did not fire and the people refused to disperse, despite the presence of several hundred soldiers. Another activist said about 10 people were injured and that some protesters threw themselves in front of a tank. A journalist at the republic's official news agency, <PERSON> Gruzinform </PERSON>, said the republic's leadership was meeting urgently in government headquarters that were surrounded by the protesters. He spoke on condition of anonymity. Forces of the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> moved into <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> on Friday after strikes and protests closed down much of the city. Witnesses reported seeing tanks and armored personnel carriers as well soldiers, but official sources said they had no knowledge of tanks being deployed. Nationalists have been demonstrating and conducting a hunger strike to demand independence and an end to what they consider <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> interference in their dealings with the <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. They barricaded themselves behind buses on <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Square </ORGANIZATION> in front of government offices to prevent government tanks and troops from breaking up their protests, activists said. In the first report on the unrest by the central press, the government daily <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> did not mention calls for independence but said `` anti-Soviet, anti-socialist'' slogans were seen at the <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> demonstrations. The report said the main goal of the <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> protest was to object to unspecified `` unconstitutional actions'' by <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION> residents. That appeared to be a reference to calls by Abkhazians to secede from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and become a separate Soviet republic. In addition to pressing their independence demands, the Georgian protesters claim the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> is stirring up ethnic unrest in the autonomous region of <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION> in their southern republic. Activists reported clashes between Georgians and Abkhazians last weekend in the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> resort of <LOCATION> Sukhumi </LOCATION>. Several people said unrest began in the region when thousands of Abkhazians, a small minority, gathered in the settlement of <LOCATION> Lichni </LOCATION> two weeks ago to petition for <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION> to secede from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and become a republic. Ms. <PERSON> Chiza </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that most public tranportation was not operating in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> today, and other sources said only stores and food processing plants were open. `` The whole city is paralyzed,'' she said. The crowd gathered in the square paralyzed traffic in the center of the city of 1.2 million people. Earlier today, activist <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Dandurov </PERSON> estimated the number of tanks at 10 and said they had injured eight or nine young people. He said in a telephone call from <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> that several people threw themselves at the first tank, shouting, `` Death to the Russian occupiers!'' The unrest was the latest outpouring of nationalist feeling in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, a country of more than 100 ethnic groups. Tensions have run particularly high in the southern <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> is located, because of earlier clashes between neighboring Armenians and Azerbaijanis. <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chanturia </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday that 158 Georgians began a hunger strike at government buildings Tuesday and plan to continue it until April 14, the anniversary of a demonstration for ethnic rights in 1978. He said they are demanding an independent <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. Last fall, demonstrators marched in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> with demands ranging from Georgian independence to the manufacture of more Georgian-language typewriters. Soviet authorities also responded to ethnic unrest in neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> with troops in the past year. More than 90 people were killed in the ethnic clashes, mostly in November, and those two republics remained under military control and curfews for months.

<HEAD>Utah Legislature Approves $5 Million Request For Fusion Research</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Seeing a potential bonanza if two scientists' claims of a new way to create fusion prove true, the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> voted to appropriate $ 5 million to accelerate the research at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION>. Following assurances from Gov. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON> that he was n't asking for a blank check, the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> on Friday approved the funds but stressed that no money would be spent until the experiment was confirmed Neither of the two researchers who claim to have produced nuclear fusion in a test tube, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southampton </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, was present. <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON> and other officials say their claim, if true, could bring the state millions of dollars in patent and licensing royalties. `` I want the state to get going. We're not asking for a blank check. We just want to be able to expedite the process so that it can take us where it's going to take us,'' <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON> told a joint session of the Legislature. Lawmakers also passed legislation creating a nine-member state <ORGANIZATION> Fusion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to oversee the research. They approved the two bills overwhelmingly after hearing presentations from <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> and members of the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regents </ORGANIZATION>. Fusion is the energy source that powers the sun and hydrogen bombs. The energy produced by nuclear power plants comes from fission, which splits atoms. During fusion, they are joined together. Ordinarily, fusion requires extremely high heat. But <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> contend that they sustained a controlled fusion reaction at room temperature, using materials found in any college laboratory, and produced four times the amount of energy required to run the experiment. Their findings were immediately cited by some as the door to a long-range, safe, cheap energy source _ if they are confirmed by other tests and transferred to a large-scale project. However, some scientists have said they can not duplicate the experiment and doubt its validity. Legislators stressed that no money would be spent until the experiment is confirmed. `` If you're asking if there is a possibility of a runaway train, we have n't even gotten the train to move yet,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Moody </PERSON>. `` Before a single dime is spent, we have to have fusion confirmed.'' The appropriations bill allocates $ 2 million for the current fiscal budget and $ 3 million for fiscal 1990, and authorizes the new council to spend up to $ 300,000 for legal services, including patent research. Attorney General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dam </PERSON> told the body he needs at least $ 75,000 immediately to hire international patent experts to advise the state on how to protect the process.

 Back-to-back visits by <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> have restored <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> momentum in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> but the outlook for peace talks is unclear until skeptical Palestinians decide their next move. They are faced with the hard choice of electing leaders to negotiate with an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> government that has ruled out statehood, or using force and diplomacy to try to dislodge <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s endorsement of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s proposal for elections in the territories was coupled during the visits with a reiteration of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> opposition to establishment of an independent Palestinian state. These moves cheered the <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> government, which had been urged by the administration to come up with `` new ideas'' for dealing with the 1.4 million Palestinians who have been under Israeli control since 1967. While the details are not clear, the goal set by the prime minister is a trial period of local self-rule, with negotiations on a permanent settlement to be conducted afterward by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should end its occupation of the territories and had no sovereignty claim to the land lost by the Arabs in the 1967 Six-Day war. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s endorsement of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s election proposal tended to overshadow the strong statement, but it registered on the Israeli government because it is an unqualified demand Previous administrations left open the possibility that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> might retain some of the land as a security zone while trading territory for peace. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> reiterated his position that retention of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> is essential for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security. His concern is not that a small <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state would overwhelm <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> militarily. Rather, a close aide said, the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s stated strategy is to gain a foothold on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and to trigger a war between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the Arab countries. The <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Arabs enjoy a 10-1 advantage in weapons, while <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> stressed in a speech Thursday that the most densely populated center of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, without the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, is as wide as the distance between the White House and suburban <LOCATION> Chevy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION>. `` The choice is not between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> keeping the territories or risking war,'' he said. `` The opposite is true. If we leave, there will almost certainly be war.'' At the end of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s visit the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> delegation seemed satisfied with the results. Privately, the official said, they had told their <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hosts at the start that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration was drifting toward support of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> positions and that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was prepared to make a public issue of its concern. `` The critical thing to change is the signal the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is sending the Arabs,'' the official said. `` Both sides decided to find a middle ground, and we found it.'' Still, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will keep talking to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, to the dismay of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which accuses the group of unrelenting terrorism. And <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s statements on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> appear to leave no room for compromise. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s visit, meanwhile, produced <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assurances that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> consider the situation in the territories untenable. The Egyptian leader worked hard at trying to convince them that an international peace conference would instantly produce direct negotiations between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the Arabs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gave the idea lukewarm endorsement, saying a conference might help at the appropriate time and under the right circumstances. More important, from <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s viewpoint, the president and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> left no doubt the administration would not permit the situation in the territories to stagnate. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> underscored a need for `` creativity'' and `` imaginative ways'' of rethinking the peace process. His exploration of the possibilities will resume April 19 with a visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. Over the long run, though, the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>' response to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s proposal could hold the key. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said a majority of the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> want a peaceful settlement in preference to their 15 -LCB- - month bloody uprising He also predicted they are likely to participate in the election. Their initial response was a cool one, while <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, on a visit to <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>, criticized the proposal as inappropriate and said the uprising would continue `` until the ultimate victory.'' <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Sindora </PERSON>, editor of the pro-PLO daily <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fajr </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, said, `` I think the intefadeh will continue until <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> comes up with a better proposal.'' But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, declaring that `` the climate is better than it's been for a while,'' said the election plan represents a welcome step toward progress. `` In the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, a little step sometimes can ... prove to be fruitful,'' he said Friday.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Laws approved by parliament this week have ushered in a new era of competitive elections in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> that will break the communist party's long monopoly on power. The laws also created a new legislative chamber that will be the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first such democratically elected body. Polish lawmakers passed their historic reforms Friday in a quick series of votes as amendments to the constitution. They created a presidency, a freely elected <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and new electoral laws. A Solidarity committee created by leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> plans to meet today to discuss potential opposition candidates. The constitutional amendments follow major political reforms in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which last month held its first contested elections in seven decades of communist rule. However, only candidates approved by officially sanctioned groups were allowed to run in the Soviet races. The bills stem from an agreement Wednesday in an opposition-government committee on political reform. The group formed part of two-month talks between the Solidarity-led opposition and communist authorities. The opposition agreed to participate in the Sejm, or parliament, in exchange for restoration of the legal status of the independent trade union Solidarity. The union was banned after authorities imposed martial law in December 1981. The amendments call for creating a 100-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to be freely elected in June. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s primary function will be to act as a control on the Sejm, especially `` in the field of human rights as well as socio-economic life,'' Wednesday's agreement said. The current 460-member <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> will remain in place as the `` supreme authority of legislative power.'' However, 35 percent of its seats will now be open to candidates independent of the Polish <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- communist -RRB- Party. The party and its allies will occupy the other 65 percent, making the communists a minority party that must work with coalition partners to create a voting majority. Those allies, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, thus expect to gain more independence and power. The arrangement could produce some lively results in now placid chamber. Anyone who collects 3,000 signatures can run for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> or for the independent Sejm seats. Previously, only candidates approved by election commissions formed by the <ORGANIZATION> communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> and its allies could be placed on the ballot. The election law also guarantees the opposition access to state-controlled media and the chance to publish a newspaper during the campaign. The constitutiomal amendments also create a post of president, which existed in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> before World War II. While the legislative changes are meant to enhance democracy, the six-year presidency is a party-inspired brake to ensure that the party retains control for the immediate future. The president's term of office will last six years. He can refuse to sign a bill into law. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> can overrule a presidential veto with a two-thirds vote. The Sejm and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> jointly elect the president, who is expected to be Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>. He was leader when Solidarity was banned.

 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and his allies are hoping for the best but preparing for the worst as a nine-month ethics committee probe of his finances enters what appears to be its final week. With his power and leadership post on the line, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> is already mounting a counteroffensive in anticipation of potentially damaging findings when the ethics panel delivers its report. Among the preparations: _ <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Oldaker </PERSON>, is meeting with dozens of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats in an effort to answer some of the major allegations swirling around the speaker. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> lieutenants are carrying thick, black notebooks prepared by <PERSON> Oldaker </PERSON> that respond point by point. _ The <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> camp is believed to have planted a mid-week story saying the ethics panel has essentially dismissed three of the six original charges. And <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> business partner <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> has been offering interviews in which he blasts the committee's special investigator, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, as overzealous. _ Democrats are painting the case as purely a political vendetta, ignited by jealousy over <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s legislative success and ability to influence <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policy on <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. _ In public statements, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has gradually come around to saying he may have made mistakes. In a letter to his hometown <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star-Telegram </ORGANIZATION>, he said, however, that `` if I have ever even technically violated any such rule, it would have been unintentional.'' The ethics panel, formally known as the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, starts its third week of deliberations Tuesday. Chairman <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., says it is likely to get down to reaching conclusions this week But the findings will not be announced until a report is prepared, he said, and that might not be until next week. And in a move that seemed unlikely to bode much good for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, the panel last week sought an additional $ 400,000 in investigative expenses, including an extension of <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>'s contract through June. Two major questions are concerning the committee at this point, according to sources who asked not to be identified. One is whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, through bulk sales of his book, `` Reflections of a Public Man,'' evaded limits on outside speaking and writing fees. The other is whether perhaps $ 100,000 in benefits paid by <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, amount to improper gifts. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has assembled a volunteer defense team, including Reps. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> Steny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON>, D-Md., who have been circulating among colleagues and inviting them to meetings with <PERSON> Oldaker </PERSON> `` There's been an effort to give <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> members some background on what's been happening,'' <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> said. `` To let them know what the facts are, what the ethics committee is most seriously examining ... We want to present what the speaker's positions are, rather than have them just read the newspaper. <PERSON> Oldaker </PERSON> says that on one crucial issue _ whether <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> had an interest in legislation before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ investigator <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> is trying to apply rules retroactively. Benefits <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and his wife received from <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> were offered mostly before 1986, while any possible legislative interest by the developer came after that date, says <PERSON> Oldaker </PERSON>. If <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s standing on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> is imperiled, it will be because he has become politically too hot to handle for fellow Democrats. One senior Democrat said lawmakers had found during their Easter recess that `` it's beginning to be an issue out in the country.'' For all the gloom, though, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> backers note with satisfaction that Democrats scored victories in a pair of recent congressional elections to fill vacancies in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. `` If people were upset ... would they elect someone from <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s party?'' asked <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON>. `` It's not a negative for us.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, meanwhile, is portraying himself as tending to business as usual. He delivered a foreign policy speech on Friday on one of his favorite topics, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, to a Democratic policy group. And he met earlier in the week with Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, only to face questions about his ethics case from reporters when cameras were admitted to the room for a picture-taking session. `` What we're seeing is a heightened virulence of the political debate, and what is perceived to be fair game,'' said <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON>. He blamed much of the atmosphere on newly elected Minority Whip <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., who demanded the ethics probe in the first place Many believe his elevation to the No. 2 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leadership post amounted to a reward for his handling of the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> case

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> warned Saturday that <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s Marxist government risks `` serious consequences'' after a Soviet-made Scud B missile landed inside <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> territory. The Afghan government called it an accident, saying the missile missed its guerrilla target near <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> and landed across the border. But it refused to apologize and again accused <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> of aiding the U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas. The missile hit about 500 yards inside the border early Friday. It damaged a post office in the village of <LOCATION> Torkham </LOCATION> but injured no one, government officials said. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying the incident was a `` brazen act of provocation by the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime which was clearly designed to internationalize the situation in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in order to save itself from the wrath of its own people.'' <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> pledged to `` take all the necessary measures to defend itself, and the lives and property of its citizens against such attacks,'' the statement said. The missile _ with a range of up to 175 miles _ was believed launched from the Afghan capital, about 120 miles west of the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border. The guerrillas launched an offensive in March on <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, 45 miles west of the border, and government troops have been blasting the <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> area with SS-1 Scud missiles. In <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said the missile landed over the border by mistake. `` It was an accident,'' he said, adding: `` We do not need to apologize when <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is conducting its onslaught without any apology.'' <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> has repeatedly accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of sending military personnel into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to orchestrate Moslem rebel attacks on government troops, who have been left to defend the country after a Soviet troop pullout was completed in February. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> denies direct involvement. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said the missile strike caused casualties but he did not elaborate. In the battle for <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said 78 guerrillas and nine civilians were killed in the last 24 hours and asserted that no government troops were killed. The report could not be verified. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> also said that as of Saturday afternoon, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> was still waiting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to grant him a visa to travel to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He is carrying an appeal from President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> for an urgent <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> session to address the Afghan crisis. The Pakistani statement claimed the missile incident was a ploy to convince the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to debate the Afghan crisis even though the charter of the 15-nation council prohibits debate on domestic issues. `` The regime has resorted to its standard litany of baseless and irrelevant allegations against <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in an attempt to portray the situation inside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> as a bilateral problem with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> that would threaten international peace,'' the statement said. The Afghan charge d'affaires was summoned to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> and warned `` the responsibility for serious consequences that arise from such an attack rests entirely on the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government.'' In March, a Scud missile landed about 300 yards from the border on the Afghan side of <LOCATION> Torkham </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> said at the time it was not concerned with what happened inside Afghan territory. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> gave <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> the missiles in November despite protests from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Moslem insurgents headquartered in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> have waged more than a decade of war against <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s communist government. Beginning in December 1979, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> sent more than 100,000 troops into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to replace one communist government with another. In April 1988, an agreement was signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> providing for the withdrawal of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> force. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> have continued to supply weapons to their respective allies.

<HEAD>Census Questions Ready for 1990 Count</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Just a year from now, more than 100 million census forms will cascade into American homes in the 21st national head count. Most folks will find the questions familiar, but there are some changes from the past. The Constitution requires that the census be taken every year ending in a zero, and that the count then be used to decide how many seats in the House of Representatives belong to each state. Practically from the nation's beginning, however, the government has asked for more information than just how many people there are. The additional questions provide data used to assess who Americans are, their economic and social condition, and to help design programs to deal with problems. While some people complain that the requests for information invade their privacy, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> refuses to ask things it considers too intrusive. For example, requests that it ask people about their religion, sexual preference, pets or handedness, were turned down. The questions to be asked in 1990 were developed during a series of public hearings in all 50 states over several years. The planned questions were also submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for review. While printing of the 1990 census forms has only just gotten underway, preliminary copies were obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Demographics </ORGANIZATION> magazine, which specializes in population issues. Essentially there are two forms, short and long. The short form contains seven population questions and seven housing questions, which officials want answered by every household in the country. Those questions are also the first part of the long form, which will go to 17 percent of households and asks for considerably more detail. American Demographics noted that a major change from 1980 will distinguish between natural-born children and stepchildren in this era of increasingly common divorce and remarriage. New questions about pension will allow statisticians to get a better idea about the economic well-being of the elderly, and for the first time the agency will ask about condominium fees, second mortgages and mobile homes. Here is a question-by-question rundown on the 1990 census shortform: 1. Name of each person living in the household. 2. How is this person related to the first person listed. Once upon a time, the first person was listed as the `` head'' of the household, but that term is no longer used. The form simply seeks to relate everyone to whomever the family lists first. Choices include husband, wife, natural born or adopted child, stepchild, father, mother, grandchild and other. 3. Sex. Only two choices here. 4. Race. The choices are <PERSON> White </PERSON>, black, American Indian, Eskimo, Aleut, Chinese, Filipino, Hawaiian, Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese, Asian Indian, Samoan, Guamian and other. 5. Age and year of birth. 6. Marital status. Choices include now married, widowed, divorced, separated and never married. 7. Is this person of Hispanic origin? Choices include no; yes Mexican, yes Cuban, yes Puerto Rican and yes other. H1. Did you leave anyone out of your list of persons for Question 1 because you were not sure if this person should be listed _ for example, someone temporarily away on a business trip or vacation, a newborn baby still in the hospital or a person who stays here once in a while and has no other house? H1. Did you include anyone in your list of persons for Question 1 even though you were not sure that the person should be listed _ for example a visitor who is staying here temporarily or a person who usually lives somewhere else? H2. Which best describes this building? Choices include mobile home, one-family detached home, one-family attached home and choices of several sized apartment buildings. H3. How many rooms do you have in this house or apartment? Do not count bathrooms, porches, balconies, foyers, halls. H4. Is this house or apartment: a. Owned by you or someone in the household with a mortgage? b. Owned by you or someone in the household free and clear? c. Rented for cash rent? d. Occupied without payment of rent. H5. If this is a one-family house, is it on 10 or more acres? H5. Is there a business, such as a store or barber shop of medical office on this property? H6. If you own, what is the value of this property? That is, how much do you think this house and lot or condominium would sell for if it were for sale? H7. If you rent, what is the amount of monthly rent? H7. Does this rent include any meals?

 The drug dealers along 3rd Avenue in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> neighborhood all know <PERSON> Ann-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Adker </PERSON> She's the nice old woman who will bid them a good day, then call the police. `` I walk down the street and give them a wave and they say ` Hi, Mom,' and I keep walking,'' <PERSON> Adker </PERSON> said. `` It's when I get home, behind closed doors, that I let the police know. You're just asking for trouble if you go confront those dealers. Your life to them is not worth a damn.'' For more than 12 years, <PERSON> Adker </PERSON> has used her inner-city crime prevention group to convince residents the best way to battle drug traffickers is behind the scenes. Direct involvement can lead to violence and retribution, she says. Her message is ringing with added clarity among community leaders these days following last month's slaying of an outspoken anti-drug activist in the crack-plagued community of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Perrine </LOCATION>, about 10 miles south of downtown. <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> police a week ago arrested two 21-year-old men on charges they opened fire on <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> outside his grocery store. Authorities called the slaying a contract hit and were searching for three suspects who allegedly ordered the killing. Police would not say how much they believe was paid to kill <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, 51, who had been the target of several shootings and death threats since 1986. One of the suspects, <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, is also accused of killing a reputed <PERSON> Perrine </PERSON> drug dealer the week before the slaying of <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, whose funeral was attended by more than 800 mourners including President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s son <PERSON> Jeb </PERSON>. `` At our meetings we never discuss who is doing drugs, because you never know who might be listening,'' <PERSON> Adker </PERSON> said. `` To be boisterous is to be foolish. This is no penny-ante game. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has won wars on foreign soil but they ca n't subdue the drug dealers We are in a war, and if you're not smart you can get yourself killed.'' `` Sure, it puts fear in your mind,'' said <PERSON> Georgia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayres </PERSON>, founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, an anti-crime panel that works with police. `` Self-preservation is the first law of nature. Most people are going to back down if they or their family is threatened. `` The shooting of Mr. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> shows how little regard they have for human life. If you get in their way, they'll kill you.'' Police, who have a tip-line to encourage citizens to report suspected criminal activity, expressed regret at <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>'s shooting but said they could n't offer round-the-clock protection on the basis of vague death threats <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, who had met with <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> and other community leaders three days before the slaying, said after the shooting: `` You do n't know how bad I feel. They were going to assist us by identifying some of the individuals. We just ca n't live in this kind of society.'' But he said `` we ca n't assign a policeman around the clock to stay with somebody unless we have specifics. I do n't know what we could have done.'' For some residents, a call to <PERSON> Irby </PERSON> <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s Urban League chapter is as far as they will go in reporting suspected drug activity. He says he senses the growing apprehension among the formerly bold tipsters. `` The fear of retaliation is strong in the community,'' said <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON>, a crime-prevention specialist. `` They think the drug dealers are in control and the best thing to do is keep quiet.'' But others hope the much-publicized <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> slaying will awaken more residents to challenge the strong-arm reign of drug traffickers in some poor neighborhoods. Last weekend, more than 100 West <PERSON> Perrine </PERSON> residents and clergy members took part in an anti-drug march that was being organized by <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> before the slaying. `` We can not afford to be afraid,'' said <PERSON> Johnnie </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillian </PERSON>, president of the Miami-Dade chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People. `` We are all in danger and we ca n't save ourselves by being afraid.'' At <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION>'s March 25 funeral, many calls were made to use the death as a rallying point against drug-related violence. `` You could interpret the shooting as a message that the drug dealers are in control or that things have gotten to a point where we have to make a stand,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, executive director of the Tacolcy community center in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> section. `` I do n't think people want to live in fear and silence.''

<HEAD>Nation's School Buildings Growing Old and Overcrowded, Survey Finds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 22,000 school buildings in the nation are inadequate and 13 percent of those are structurally unsound, according to a study released Saturday by the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The study found that one in four of the nation's 88,021 public school buildings need maintenance or major repairs, are overcrowded or obsolete, present environmental hazards or have multiple problems. Another third stack up as `` only adequate and because of growing enrollments and deferred maintenance could easily become inadequate,'' said the study, called `` Wolves at the Schoolhouse Door.'' The study cites antiquated facilities, an enrollment boom and inadequate capital funds in concluding that `` the schoolhouse may be the most seriously threatened part of the infrastructure.'' The <ORGANIZATION> EWA </ORGANIZATION> based its findings on federal statistics, national surveys, surveys of school building personnel at 38 <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> departments </ORGANIZATION>, state reports on school buildings and analyses of buildings in seven representative states. One-fifth of the nation's schools were constructed more than 50 years ago, the association said. Nearly two-thirds were built in the 1950s and 1960s, `` generally a time of rapid and cheap construction ... Many construction experts say the buildings were intended to last only about 30 years. If so, their time is up.'' The group said replacement costs for all school buildings are estimated at $ 422 billion. States estimate schools need $ 84 billion in new or retrofitting construction and $ 41 million in maintenance and repairs. Many states and school districts are investing below the recommended level of 2 to 4 percent of replacement value in annual maintenance, the study found. Specifically it cited <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> with investments of 1.4 percent, 2.2 percent, 2.2 percent and 1.3 percent respectively. <PERSON> EWA </PERSON> noted that a school building boom is under way. It cited <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> statistics that school construction was up almost 50 percent from 1982 to 1986. It said school districts estimate they will spend nearly $ 22 billion on new construction, additions and modernization between 1988 and 1990. In addition, school bonds led all categories of municipal bonds in 1987 with a value of $ 9 billion. But <PERSON> EWA </PERSON> pointed out that only a small percentage of students will ever attend new schools. `` Most will spend their school days in old, sometimes remodeled, buildings; many will shuffle to and fro among portable buildings.'' And it noted that new investment varies substantially by region. The South led in dollar volume in 1986-87 at $ 1.33 billion, the study said. Next was the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> at $ 1.06 billion, followed by <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> at $ 857 million. The West, consisting of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, was fourth. School investment dropped in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> while stabilizing in the <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> states. Based on responses from 14 states, `` only 39 percent of the projected funding needs for construction and renovation will be met between 1989 and 1992,'' <PERSON> EWA </PERSON> said. Sixteen states gave districts no capital financing assistance, the study said, including two with the most severe enrollment crunches _ <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> EWA </PERSON> said erratic data collection, inconsistent state involvement and the unevenness of the problem are depriving districts of an opportunity to make long-term plans and avoid past mistakes. `` These problems can not be overlooked much longer,'' the group warned. `` The uneven distribution of resources and planning capacities allows tremendous inequities in the local environment that prespares children for the future, often within a few miles of each other.'' EWA is an association of education writers for publications across the country. Its report was released at the group's annual seminar.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is flying the bare-bones schedule it has kept since a strike began last month while its three unions and prospective new owners meet through the weekend in hopes of making a deal to revive the carrier. The negotiations, which entered their second day today, center on concessions sought by former baseball commissioner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> and his partners. But before agreeing to any wage and benefit cuts the unions are seeking assurances the new owners have a plan to bring bankrupt Eastern back to profitability. The two sides met most of the day Friday in sessions described by one source as `` highly preliminary'' and focused primarily on the language of the <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> group's tentative agreement to buy <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Talks resumed at about 10 a.m. today <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, appointed by a bankruptcy judge as examiner to oversee Eastern operations, is mediating the discussions. Union officials said it was highly unlikely a deal would be struck during the weekend. A deadline does loom, however. <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>'s $ 464 million purchase agreement allows him to call off the deal if he does not reach new contract agreements with the unions by midnight Tuesday. `` This will take some time because it's not only money involved,'' said an <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> official who asked not to be identified. `` How does our ownership part shape up? How do we get our passengers back? What kind of job security is involved?'' <ORGANIZATION> IAM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Conley </PERSON> said the unions would have no statement on the negotiations because both sides in the talks had agreed to a news blackout requested by the bankruptcy judge overseeing Eastern. That judge would have to approve any sale of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which has been all but grounded since the Machinists struck March 4. The airline's pilots and flight attendants have honored <ORGANIZATION> IAM </ORGANIZATION> pickets. In other development, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> filed a lawsuit Friday alleging that takeover specialist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> was trying to interfere with the sale.

<HEAD>Plenty of Reactors Available to Make Material for Nuclear Bombs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Even if the <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> keeps his pledge to shut down three military reactors, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will have at least 11 others able to make material for nuclear bombs, according to experts and documents available in the West. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in his latest arms control gesture, announced in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Friday that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had shut down one plutonium-enrichment reactor in 1987 and would close two more over the next two years. He said his country would stop producing weapons-grade uranium. The size and even the location of Soviet military reactors is a closely guarded secret, and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> did not spell out which reactors would be closed, and which or even how many would remain open. `` The difficulty we have is that he has wrapped his program in such a veil of secrecy that we can not get a reading of how much further he needs to go,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, a nuclear physicist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. `` On the uranium side, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had produced a huge surplus of weapons uranium in 1964, and shut off all production of that. What he is doing is do what we did 25 years ago,'' said <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>. The Soviets already have an estimated 115 metric tons of plutonium and 500 metric tons of enriched uranium, mostly in the 32,000 nuclear weapons thought to be in their arsenal, said <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, co-authors of a book on the Soviet weapons complex. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has about 110 metric tons of plutonium, with further production frozen because the only three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reactors able to produce nuclear weapons materials, at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Site </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, have been shut down because they can not be operated safely. <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, who has extensive contacts with Soviet scientists and arms control officials and travels regularly to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, said he had advised the Russians to seek a freeze like the one proposed by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` We pointed out to them the timeliness of this, as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> prepares to make major commitment'' to spend an estimated $ 8 billion to build a new generation of weapons reactors at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> clearly has taken a step that sends a signal that they are ready to enter negotiations on ending production of fissionable materials'' used in nuclear weapons, said <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were slow to respond to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposal. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, at his news conference Friday, said he had not analyzed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposal, `` so I honestly ca n't tell you that I know the full significance.'' One government expert on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear industry said it appeared that the plants mentioned in <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s announcement were being closed for safety reasons. `` My estimate is that he is making some political mileage out of steps they have taken for safety reasons,'' said the official, speaking on condition that he not be further identified. Intelligence analysts declined to divulge their data on the Soviet nuclear weapons complex, but two officials with access to the classified reports said the information provided by <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> and <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> in telephone interviews went significantly beyond what has been disclosed in public. The Soviets maintain two major weapons complexes, one at <LOCATION> Kyshtym </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Chelyabinsk </LOCATION> and the other at <LOCATION> Tomsk </LOCATION>, deep in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>. Those two complexes apparently are the sites of 14 Soviet weapons reactors mentioned by Assistant Secretary of Energy <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> in testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year. It was not clear whether that number included the one shut own in 1987. Six of the reactors, known as the <LOCATION> Troitsk </LOCATION> series, are located at <LOCATION> Kyshtym </LOCATION> and are run by the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medium </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION>, one of 12 Soviet defense industry ministries, according to government officials. The actual number of Soviet reactors able to produce weapons material may be much higher, <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> said, because they use water-cooled graphite reactors, like the RBMK reactors at <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>, to make nuclear weapons materials as well as electricity for civilian use. Two of the Troistsk reactors were built in the late 1950's, a few years after the three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear weapons production reactors at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, and could be ready for retirement, according to one government analyst.

<HEAD>Charges Filed Against Hijacker of New York-Bound Bus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities on Saturday charged a <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> man who hijacked a New York-bound Greyhound bus and held its driver and 10 passengers hostage for eight hours outside <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Yacoub </PERSON> appeared briefly in court and was charged with hostage-taking, unlawful confinement, using a firearm in a criminal act and illegal possession of a firearm. The hostage-taking charge could bring a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. <PERSON> Yacoub </PERSON>, 32, was ordered held in custody pending another hearing Monday. Police said <PERSON> Yacoub </PERSON> hijacked the bus in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, diverted it to <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> and held police at bay for eight hours, saying he had dynamite. The bus had veered and stopped on the lawn outside the center of Canadian government. The hijacking ended peacefully and without injuries Friday evening, and Canadian police said the hostages were flown to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> at Greyhound expense. <ORGANIZATION> CTV </ORGANIZATION> television quoted security forces as saying the gunman was demanding Syrian troops withdraw from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and free all prisoners. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> sent troops into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as a peacekeeping force after the civil war between Lebanese Moslems and Christians erupted in 1975. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, deputy commissioner of the Royal Canadian MMounties, said <PERSON> Yacoub </PERSON> emigrated to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1976. Police said he identified himself as acting on behalf of the Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION>, a group that authorities were not sure existed. The incident posed questions about government security. Quebec provincial police alerted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> border authorities but not security forces in neighboring <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>. The hijacker released the first hostage, an elderly man, at the <LOCATION> Champlain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> just outside of <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> before heading on to <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>, 100 miles to the west. Police said the hijacker told the hostage: `` You're going to get off here _ everything is going to blow up.'' Three female hostages and one man were released in the first few hours of the <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> standoff, and the male driver left the vehicle just before the hijacking came to an end. Police briefly checked the final five hostages before concluding they were not involved with the hijacker. No explosives were found. The red-white-and-blue bus, which left deep ruts in the usually immaculate lawns of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION>, was towed to a police garage Saturday.

 Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> Slaughter has been inaugurated as the first black president in the 102-year history of <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, and trustees said they hope he'll prepare the school for a more diverse future. More than 200 representatives of colleges and scholarly organizations attended Friday's inauguration at the park-like campus, said <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>. Slaughter, the school's 11th president, physically took over the job last August when Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON> resigned the post, which he had held for 23 years. Slaughter, 55, had been chancellor of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION>, and previously was director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. Since its founding in 1887, <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> had been a small, prestigious liberal arts college with a mostly white student population. The fact that Slaughter is black, and his extensive background in engineering, appealed to the board of trustees, Ms. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said. `` There was a recognition by the trustees, who are largely white males ... that change is coming, that the next century is going to require a different approach,'' she said. `` The population of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> shows you that white males are becoming a minority. There was a feeling among the trustees that we needed to find somebody who bridges many fields, many cultures.'' Slaughter, born in <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, received his Bachelor of Science degree from <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1956.

 Another <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> will soon reign from the fifth floor of City Hall and in the old neighborhood, in places like <PERSON> Vita </PERSON>'s Clips and Snips, <PERSON> Grassano </PERSON>'s Jewelry and <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>'s Tap, all seems right with the world again. `` You go to work, you raise a family, you keep up your property, you live with your own,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Burba </PERSON>, ticking off the priorities for residents of <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>, the working-class, <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Side </ORGANIZATION> enclave that Mayor-elect <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, his late father, Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, and three other <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> mayors have called home. `` And,'' he added, `` you have a <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> calling the shots downtown.'' Nearly a week after the mayoral election, the familiar red, white and blue <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> campaign posters remain tied to trees and taped to windows. But nothing is like it once was _ even in fabled <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>. There are more blacks, more Asians, many more Hispanics and fewer city jobs to go around than there once were. The stockyards nearby are shuttered, a few storefronts along the commercial artery are boarded up, pockets of poverty swell at its edges, and even the most unabashed <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> backers among its 32,000 residents know the son ca n't recreate the halcyon days of the father. It has been 12 years since that fateful day when <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON>, age 74 and less than a year into his sixth term, suffered a heart attack and died. Shock waves rippled across all of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, but nowhere with more effect than in <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>. The Old Man, as <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> is still called with affection, rarely missed a christening, a wedding or a wake and almost everyone in <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION> _ or so it seems _ knew him, his wife, or one of their seven children. And more than a few owed their livelihood to the acquaintance. `` We've got firemen, people from -LRB- the departments of -RRB- streets and sanitation, water, whatever. ... A lot of people still work for the city,'' <PERSON> Burba </PERSON> said. `` But it's nothing like it once was.'' When <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> became the first of five native sons to call the shots downtown in 1933, <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION> was a Democratic precinct captain's dream, an all-white, blue-collar neighborhood covering three square miles, full of immigrants from <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> living in single-family brick bungalows or small apartment buildings. So well-oiled was <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>'s political machinery that when <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> left the mayor's office in 1947, it went to another native son, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennelly </PERSON>, who was, in turn, pushed out of the way eight years later by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>. After <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s death in late 1976, yet another Bridgeporter, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilandic </PERSON>, filled the rest of <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s term and to the victorious continued to flow most of the spoils. But soon thereafter, the courts narrowed the stream with a series of decisions severely limiting political hirings and firings. And in 1979, an upstart Democrat named <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, a one-time protege of the elder <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> who spent much of her subsequent term fearing a challenge from the younger <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, upset <PERSON> Bilandic </PERSON> in the mayor's race and shut the spigot completely. Residents differ, sometimes heatedly, on whether garbage pickup, snow removal and other city services got better or worse under the late <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, who defeated Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> in 1983 to become <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s first black mayor. It was <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s death in late 1987, just months into his second term, that set in motion the rise to power of the younger <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>. Pearl <PERSON> Koltz </PERSON> usually solves such debates simply by reminding both sides, `` we got kind of spoiled.'' Almost no one in <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION> expects it to happen again, even with `` <PERSON> Richie </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> in charge. `` Times change,'' said <PERSON> Sherri </PERSON> <PERSON> Yersich </PERSON>, trying to corral her three youngsters in front of the two-flat across the street from <PERSON> Burba </PERSON>'s home. `` People who come into the neighborhood now think it's political But I hear stories from my uncle ... who used to be a precinct captain, about how everybody, even kids, used to pass out literature and ring doorbells and that kind of stuff. It just does n't go on much anymore. `` I mean, my husband works for the city, and he's a good friend of <PERSON> Richie </PERSON>'s. But other than go to his victory party the other night, we did n't really do much. `` But you know what? I grew up in <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION> and lived here all my life,'' she added, `` and just knowing <PERSON> Richie </PERSON> is the mayor makes things seem a little more like they've always been.''

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> looked more at home in the splendor of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s ancient Guildhall than in shirt-sleeves in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> during the Soviet president's six-day trip abroad. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s gains, if any, from private talks with <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> president <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> may not be apparent for some time, but he reaped positive news during his later stop in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> got a ringing endorsement from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s staunchly anti-communist prime minister and a promise of a visit from Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. The queen would be the first <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> monarch to visit <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> since the Communists killed <PERSON> Czar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> and his family, who were cousins of the queen's forebears. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said they were disappointed that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> produced no signal the Soviets were prepared to disengage from <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, where the superpowers are pitted against each other by proxy <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> stressed solidarity, though <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has shown no inclination toward liberalization policies being adopted in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and much of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who has shown more interest in wooing Western banks and business than in propping up Third World revolutionaries, made no move to ease <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s huge debt burden. Analysts had speculated some measure of debt forgiveness might be forthcoming as a good-will gesture during the Soviet President's first visit to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. Instead, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government should be more careful in spending Soviet aid. `` As in the past, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> have a common approach to the key problems of international affairs,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Cuban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are resolutely against any theories and doctrines justifying the export of revolution or counterrevolution and all forms of interference in the affairs of sovereign nations.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he welcomed the statement but said it was not supported by action. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, which just committed to end military aid to the Contra rebels in Soviet-backed <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, had hoped for a clearer signal that the Soviet government would reduce arms shipments to the Sandinista regime, he said. But seasoned observers in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> said even if that was <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s intention, he would not have said so in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s strongest ally. Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said people have come to expect too much from the Soviet leader. `` It's the rabbit-from-the-hat approach,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. `` With other politicians, you do n't expect so much, but when <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> speaks, you expect him to pull out a rabbit every time.'' But after leaving the island, a <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> aide hinted that the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief may try to mediate the long-running feud between <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Although <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s public remarks were peppered with anti-American slogans, <PERSON> Georgi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakhnazarov </PERSON>, a foreign policy adviser to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader indicated privately he wants to normalize relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Asked if <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> could bring the two neighbors back together, <PERSON> Shakhnazarov </PERSON> said: `` The general secretary tries not to miss any opportunity'' to encourage better relations.

<HEAD>Sinking of Submarine Latest Accident to Hit Nuclear Fleet</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Soviet Sub, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The sinking of a nuclear-powered submarine off the coast of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> is at least the third serious incident in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear fleet in 2 -LCB- years and comes amid growing Soviet public concern over nuclear safety. The accident came five months after a reported near-meltdown in a nuclear reactor aboard a Soviet icebreaker in the port city of <LOCATION> Murmansk </LOCATION>. That accident touched off a public outcry that prevented another nuclear-powered ship from docking in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. In October 1986, three sailors died in a fire and explosion aboard a Yankee-class nuclear-powered submarine in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> that was armed with ballistic missiles. Since the April 26, 1986, explosion and fire at the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear power plant in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> that killed at least 31 people and sent a cloud of radiation into the atmosphere, Soviet people have become wary of nuclear power, both on land and at sea. In November, the nuclear powered icebreaker Rossiya pulled into <LOCATION> Murmansk </LOCATION>, near the border with <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, for the routine changing of a filter in one of its two pressurized reactors. A report in the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Vodny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> four months after the incident said the routine job almost turned into a disastrous nuclear meltdown. According to the report, the chief physicist aboard the ship gave incorrect instructions to a reactor operator who in turn drained vital cooling water from operating reactor rather than the one shut down for the repairs. Had the water drained 30 minutes longer, a meltdown releasing radiation into the air over the city of 440,000 people would have occurred, the newspaper said. The `` situation was liquidated'' in four minutes, the newspaper's <LOCATION> Murmansk </LOCATION> correspondent said. Three days later, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> said two cities and a region in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> refused entry to a nuclear-powered merchant ship, Sevmorput, which had reported fractures in its hull. `` A deficit of information, piled on top of the invisible shadow of the Chernobyl tragedy and the most complex ecological situation in the region, detonated a powerful explosion of public indignation,'' the newspaper said. Officials claimed that the hull fractures presented no danger to the nuclear plant on the ship, but the public was not assured. At last report, the ship was still anchored off <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION>, its fate undecided. Refusal of officials in the ports of <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION> and Nakhodka and the region of <PERSON> Magadan </PERSON> highlighted a groundswell of public opposition to nuclear power that began with the Chernobyl disaster. The policy of glasnost, or openness, initiated by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has resulted in a growing vocal opposition to nuclear power. Officials scrapped plans to build six nuclear power stations because of safety concerns. Another plant in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> was closed after the Dec. 7 earthquake that killed 25,000 people prompted fears of a nuclear disaster. Although the sinking of a nuclear submarine off the coast of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> did not affect public safety in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, it reinforced concerns about the safety of nuclear power. With those concerns in mind, officials have apparently changed the course of the country's ambitious nuclear program. Previously, nuclear stations were concentrated in populous regions in the eastern part of the country. Hydroelectric plants now will be built to supply local power and nuclear stations will be constructed in remote regions where they will pose little danger to the public.

<HEAD>Abortion Rights Activists Set for March On Capital</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scores of thousands of pro-choice activists, including a huge array of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> superstars, have thronged into the capital for a march Sunday billed as the largest demonstration ever in favor of abortion rights. `` Tomorrow is only a beginning,'' declared <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Yard </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is a statement to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that the women of this country are not going back.'' At a news conference at which she and other march organizers were cheered by dozens of show business personalities, Ms. <PERSON> Yard </PERSON> added: `` At last the majority of this country is going to stand up for our rights to control our reproductive lives.'' She predicted a turnout that would `` easily'' more than double the size of a similar march in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> three years ago. Police estimated that crowd at 90,000. <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, declined to predict a number but said: `` I'll tell you this. I think we're going to close <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> down.'' The march launches an intensified campaign by the pro-choice community to cement public opinion in favor of a women's right to abortion as the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> nears a major challenge to its landmark 1973 decision, <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, that legalized the procedure. The new case is scheduled for argument April 26. Actress Morgan Fairchild, among 250 show business personalities participating in the march and related events, said: `` We are here to support the majority in this country who believe that Americans can be trusted to make their own decisions about reproductive health care, without interference from government at any level. We believe that we, the people, rather than the politicians, should control our most intimate decisions. `` We recognize that we may have been to complacent,'' said Ms. Fairchild. `` In 1973 ... we thought this issue had been put to rest. We thought that our years of risking infection sterility, and death itself were finally over. We thought that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women would no longer die each year from botched, illegal abortions. We thought we and our daughters were safe.'' But with the pending <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case before a more conservative court, `` We are relearning what <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> taught this country more than 200 years ago: Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty,'' she said. Among those joining the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> delegation were <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Akers </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Burstyn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, <PERSON> Veronica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON>, <PERSON> Margot </PERSON> <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Manchester </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> McGillis </PERSON>, an 8-month-pregnant <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarandon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cybill </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON>. The new campaign includes the nationwide distribution of a videotape, `` Abortion: For Survival'' aimed at countering the anti-abortion movement's trademark video, `` Silent Scream.'' The pro-choice production includes footage of a woman undergoing an abortion to show the procedure is `` safe and simple,'' and includes at look at the almost indiscernible remains taken from the uterus in a first-trimester abortion. The videotape `` puts it where it's at,'' said <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Smeal </PERSON>, president of the Fund for the Feminist Majority. `` It talks about abortion as a public health necessity and essential for the well-being of millions of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women. `` It features the central issue of this debate: What is abortion, why it's needed and why the public health and medical establishment of our society and worldwide is for keeping it legal.'' The tape is being distributed to government officials and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and state legislatures as well as on college campuses nationwide, she said. March organizers said other parts of their campaign include applying pressure on government agencies and pharmaceutical companies to improve available contraception, and standing up to Operation Rescue's attempts to close down abortion clinics. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told anti-abortion activists a few days after he moved into the Oval Office that he wanted the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s 1973 decision overturned. March organizers said participants included tens of thousands of students from about 500 colleges, many of them in the Northeast, as well as delegations from churches, labor unions and other groups. The weather forecast called for sunny skies, moderate breezes, and temperatures in the 60s by the noon start. A counterdemonstration `` death march'' by anti-abortion advocates was expected to draw about 300 people, according to <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON> <PERSON> Gans </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victims </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our organization is here to support equal rights for unborn women _ specifically the right to life,'' she said. The march route of the pro-choice demonstrators will take them past a field of 4,400 white crosses erected by anti-abortion activists near the Capitol, symbolizing the number of abortions performed on an average day.

 The mushrooming political spending habits of special interest groups moderated during the last election cycle, but still reached a record $ 349.6 million, a federal agency said Saturday. Spending by 4,828 political action committees rose 5 percent during 1987 and 1988 over what it had been for the previous two-year cycle, according to figures compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. By comparison, that 1985 and 1986 spending had represented a 22 percent jump over the prior reporting period, 1983 and 1984. Democrats, who control both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, benefit most from the generosity of the special interests, according to the commission's figures. The groups tend to favor incumbents, and incumbents tend to win re-election. The tilt toward incumbents and away from challengers increased this year, and that bothers <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cause </ORGANIZATION>, a lobbying group that has opposed the political system's growing dependence on money from political action committees. These committees, also known as PACs, are a legal device that under the sponsorship of corporations, labor unions and other organizations are allowed to raise large sums of money and channel it into political campaigns. Under federal law, a PAC can give five times as much money to a particular candidate as can an individual. While a PAC can give a candidate up to $ 5,000 for each primary, runoff and general election, an individual can give only $ 1,000 in each instance. In 1987 and 1988, some $ 1.2 billion overall was spent on campaigns for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and president, including money from the federal government, individuals, political parties and PACs. Of that total, the PACs accounted for about 28 percent, according to figures compiled by the election commission. During 1987-88, the PACs put 74 percent of their money on incumbents, while in the previous two-year period 68 percent of the money went to people already in office, according to the commission's study. Challengers reaped 12 percent of the PAC money in the last election, while 14 percent got it for their races in 1986. Common Cause spokesman <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Huwa </PERSON> said the PAC money spent on congressional winners also rose last year. `` That went up from $ 101 million in 1986 to $ 122 million in 1988,'' he said. `` So members who were elected in 1988 are more indebted to PACs than any class in history, so I do n't see that necessarily as indicating that PAC growth is slowing.'' In addition to giving money directly to candidates, the PACs can spend an unlimited amount on behalf of a candidate, for example, by producing and airing television commercials. The law requires that these efforts must not be controlled by or coordinated with the candidate's campaign organization. These `` independent expenditures'' amounted to $ 20.2 million in 1988, up from $ 9.4 million in 1986, according to the commission. Almost all of that increase came from one PAC, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative organization that zoomed to the top of the charts in spending last year, with outlays of some $ 10.3 million. According to the election commission's records, nearly $ 8.1 million of that was spent for the benefit of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. However, the tone of the group's advertisements and its methods of fund raising caused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign to disavow it publicly and to file a formal complaint against it.

 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> said Saturday it has rejected a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire plan designed to halt the hostilities in northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> that threaten the territory's independence. In a letter released Saturday, South African Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> dismissed an offer by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> for amending a regional peace accord signed in December by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. Officials from those three countries, as well as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet observers, held emergency talks into Saturday night at <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Etjo </LOCATION>, a safari lodge about 120 miles north of <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s capital There was no immediate comment from those officials. The meeting was held in a bid to stop the fighting and preserve a U.N.-supervised independence plan agreed to in December. That plan took effect April 1. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>'s proposal suggested that <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas, who reportedly have entered <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> in violation of the peace accord, be given two choices, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said. The guerrillas should be allowed to keep their arms and be escorted to <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> bases in neighboring <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, or they could lay down their arms and stay in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> as civilians, he said. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> rejected the amendment, saying the guerrillas must surrender their weapons and be taken to bases in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> says <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> has sent more than 1,900 guerrillas into northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> since April 1 in violation of the peace accord, which requires the insurgents to remain at bases at least 100 miles inside <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> maintains that the insurgents were inside <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> before April 1 and will not return to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Since then, at least 262 guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and 28 members of the South African-led security forces have been killed in the heaviest fighting of the territory's 23-year war, police said. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> officials outside <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> have disputed the figures and say many civilians also have been killed. There were no reports of battles on Saturday, and officials said they believed guerrillas were running low on supplies. On Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said it was satisfied that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> still sought to grant independence to the territory it has ruled since World War I. Some <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials suggested <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> field commanders mistakenly thought their units could return to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and set up bases there. Several captured guerrillas have said they returned to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> in search of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> personnel and expected no confrontations with security forces. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> has authorized 4,650 peace-keeping troops for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, but less than 1,000 have arrived. Of that total, the only forces in the northern battle areas are about 300 logistical personnel. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> has been favored to win pre-independence elections scheduled for November under the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan. The December accord by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> called for withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops who have helped Marxist <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> battle U.S.-backed rebels. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> agreed to stop supporting the rebels and pledged independence for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>.

 Helicopters buzzed overhead and hundreds of police and soldiers patrolled the streets Saturday after dispersing 1,500 anti-American protesters commemorating last year's burning of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulate </ORGANIZATION>. `` Troops will impede, with force if necessary, any protests against our democratic institutions and the lives of Hondurans,'' armed forces spokesman, Col. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Benavides </PERSON>, said at a news conference. `` Our forces will stay in the streets until we are sure that no disorder will occur,'' he said. Police on Friday night used truncheons and water hoses to disperse protesters, who burned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flags and shouted anti-American slogans in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>. The consulate was burned last year in a week of violent anti-American protests that began after reputed drug kingpin <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> was extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Four Hondurans died and 1,000 were jailed in those protests, and the government declared a 10-day state of emergency. Under the Honduran constitution, no citizen can be extradited or forced to leave the country against his will. But <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> was captured on April 5, 1988, by Honduran authorities and two days later was extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He is serving a three-year sentence at the federal prison in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, for escaping from a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> prison in 1971. <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> allegedly is linked to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel, which reportedly controls 80 percent of cocaine traffic to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The demonstrations Friday also were to protest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. Since 1982, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> have intensified military maneuvers provided for under a 1954 treaty. In the past nine years, more than 100,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers have come to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to train the 20,000-member Honduran armed forces.

<TEXT>
 With national elections looming, three white anti-apartheid parties merged Saturday in hopes of boosting their collectively sagging fortunes. The formation of the new <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is an attempt to broaden the political base of white liberals, who have suffered repeated setbacks in recent years. `` The party commits itself to the establishment of a genuine South African democracy which rejects race as its basis, -LRB- and -RRB- protects the human dignity and liberty of all its citizens,'' said <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, a leading member of the new party. The first major test for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will come in this year's parliamentary elections, expected between late July and early September. President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> announced the election Thursday, but he has yet to set an exact date. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will have three leaders who served as the heads of the merging parties. They are <PERSON> Zac </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Beer </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Wynand </PERSON> <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Worrall </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. At a rally in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, party leaders said they oppose all forms of apartheid, support a free enterprise economic system, and want increased emphasis on individual rights. The organization seeks to attract voters disillusioned with <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and its inability to break the black-white political stalemate. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> indicated it wants to work closely with blacks, who have no vote in national affairs. However, the organization made clear that it rejects the violence employed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the main black guerrilla group attempting to undermine the government. `` Democracy can never be built on the foundation of ... bombs,'' said de Beer. `` The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> must end the campaign of symbolic terror.'' The new party has drawn little attention from black organizations, many of whom see white liberals as politically ineffective. `` The liberal left in this country has not done much to make the government change apartheid,'' said <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, a leading black-oriented newspaper. `` Until such time that we're all allowed to vote, the new <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is just another white affair.'' The Progressive <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had 17 of the 178 seats in the white chamber of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, while the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> had three and the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> none. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has ruled <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for 41 years, maintains firm control of the white chamber with 133 seats. The extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is the official opposition with 24 seats. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> announced his intention to step down after the election. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s tri-cameral <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> has separate houses for whites, Asians and people of mixed-race but not for the nation's 28-million black majority White liberal parties draw their support almost exclusively from the major urban areas such as <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, and they have been losing some support in recent years. The <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> overtook the <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 elections to become the leading opposition. The Progressive Federal Party was formed in 1959, and one of its founding members, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzman </PERSON>, has been a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> since 1953. Ms. <PERSON> Suzman </PERSON>, one of the country's best-known anti-apartheid campaigners, said she would not hold any official position in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.

 The managing editor of a major Turkish newsmagazine went into hiding after being sentenced to nine years in jail for articles carried by the leftist publication, friends say. <PERSON> Fatma </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazici </PERSON>, managing editor of the Toward 2000 weekly was charged with producing communist and Kurdish propaganda, insulting Islam and being disrespectful to the president. The 33-year-old editor went underground last month after three convictions were upheld and she was sentenced to nine years in prison, friends said. During the 26 months Ms. <PERSON> Yazici </PERSON> shouldered the news and legal responsibilities for the magazine, seven copies of the magazine were confiscated on seven occasions. She faced prosecution 32 times. Toward 2000 has been on newsstands since January 1987 and has risen to the No. 2 spot among newsweeklies, with a circulation of 30,000. The magazine has constantly been in trouble with authorities for tackling taboo subjects which often lead to prosecution under the country's restrictive press law.

 About 200 police backed by helicopters and dogs searched Saturday for six inmates who fled an overcrowded jail by sawing through the bars on a window and shimmying over a razor-sharp fence. Thirteen inmates clad in prison green escaped Friday night, but two were captured a few hours after the escape and five others were nabbed on Saturday. Helicopters hovered over snow-dusted hills and search dogs sniffed along abandoned wharves while police combed streets and alleys. The inmates, including seven awaiting trial and six convicted of charges ranging from theft to armed robbery, escaped in a group from the <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Correction </LOCATION>, where chronic overcrowding and racial tensions have fueled several outbreaks of violence in recent months. Sheriff <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said authorities viewed the break as inevitable because of the jail's crumbling structures and its dangerous mixture of inmates. The population of the 173-year-old granite fortress is at any given time likely to include mass murderers and accused burglars, teen-agers and hardened older inmates, drugs users and those with communicable diseases. The stifling conditions likely drove the men, some of whom had as few as 30 days left to serve, to commit the felony break that could put them back in jail for up to 10 years, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said. `` It certainly can drive people to drastic things,'' he said. The facility houses 240 prisoners. The federally ordered cap is 172, but corrections officials have had to house inmates in the boiler room and the recreation hall. Someone outside the jail probably tossed hacksaws over the 15-foot brick wall, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said. Cutting through the old prison bars would not have been difficult, he said. The bars are so brittle that the jail's deputies routinely strike them with rubber hammers, checking for a sound that indicates they have been sawed through. In February the jail was forced to undergo a five-day lockdown after an outbreak of violence, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said.

 Homicide detectives rank high among the types of workers most in need of a sense of humor to help lighten a difficult profession. So someone concocted a slogan, slapped it on a button and Voila!: `` Our day begins when yours ends.'' That's the serious point behind humor _ how it can relieve stress _ for <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, founder and director of the Humor Project. The group is sponsoring its fourth annual national conference this weekend on `` The Positive Power of Humor and Creativity.'' It drew hundreds of participants from as far away as <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. `` One myth is that humor equals joke-telling,'' <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> told an auditorium packed to capacity with educators and business people, health care workers, chaplains, consultants and administrators. `` Humor is not always appropriate, but it's more appropriate than people realize.'' But this is not some bunch of jokers brought together to have a laugh _ even though consummate funnyman <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Leno </PERSON> took a break from his `` Tonight Show'' guest duties and touring to perform for the group during the opening session Friday. The conference aims to help folks deal with stress in the home and workplace, find ways to be creative and also `` to take their jobs seriously but themselves lightly,'' <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> said. For the bankers, managers, engineers and tycoons, there also are workshops to help them use humor as a management tool, `` as a way of improving the corporate culture,'' <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> said. `` There's a lot of pressure in business to be more creative, to find better ways to increase productivity,'' said <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Conner </PERSON>, who owns <ORGANIZATION> Centerpoint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, a management training and consulting firm in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. She said she often runs across managers who are `` challenged beyond the skills and techniques that they have to handle those challenges.'' `` If they can laugh a little bit, it's just another way to look at a problem and deal with stress,'' she said. <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> has several theories about the power of humor, and he says everyone has an innate sense of humor `` that's often covered over by years of misuse.'' `` But even if we missed the boat when that quality was handed out, we can still develop it,'' <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> told his audience of 1,000 on Friday. He offered examples of humor from everyday life, adding that `` nothing is quite as funny as the unintended humor of reality.'' Take, for instance, the notice that appeared on a church bulletin board alerting parishioners to the sermons for the day and evening services. `` 9:30 a.m. Jesus Walks on Water. 5:30 p.m. Searching for <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>.'' Or how about the sign on a hospital bulletin board? `` Research Shows That The First 5 Minutes of Life Can Be Most Risky.'' Penciled underneath: `` The Last 5 Minutes Ai n't So Hot Either.'' Guffaws abounded as <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> strutted across the stage, much like a professional comedian. `` Humor is a way of maintaining control,'' he said, as another crop of one-liners began to build. `` It's a great way of building relationships.'' `` It's a great way of ending them.''

 Iranian leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> on Saturday ordered that aid to troops at the cease-fire line with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> be discontinued within six months, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio reported. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s order is the first indication <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> plans to cut its forces along the 670-mile border with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> since the countries halted their eight-year Persian Gulf War with a cease-fire in August. `` Deplete supplies within six months and end the work,'' the radio quoted <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> as saying in a letter to <PERSON> Hojatoleslam </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahmani </PERSON>, head of the committee responsible for sending aid to the forces at the front. The 88-year-old revolutionary patriarch appeared to be referring to border supplies the government solicited from private citizens. The radio statement, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, was unclear whether <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> wanted the supply program stopped for all armed forces or just the voluntary units known as the Basij. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers monitor the cease-fire, but separate U.N.-sponsored talks for a permanent peace have made no significant progress. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s directive follows meetings Thursday between Iranian foreign ministry officials and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials to lay the groundwork for a new round of peace talks between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, and his <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> counterpart, <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> have agreed to hold a new round of talks in the near future at an undisclosed site near <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, but no date or exact venue has been set. The talks deadlocked over <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s insistence that Iraqi troops withdraw from Iranian territory, while <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> insists that the first step should be the clearing of the Shatt al-Arab waterway.

<HEAD>Communist Guerrillas Capture Eight Mountain Climbers, Suspect Some
As Spies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Communist guerrillas said Saturday they captured eight mountain climbers, including three foreigners, on the country's tallest peak to check if any were military informants. The <ORGANIZATION> Menardo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, a guerrilla unit of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> operating in southern <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION>, said they also detained the climbers also to protect them from rebel mines. But they said the three foreigners and the five Filipinos, captured Tuesday, will be released soon because interrogation showed they were not spies. More than 300 climbers were on 9,690-foot Mount Apo for a mountaineering convention. `` The presence of foreigners in the area gave us reason to suspect they were sent by the enemies in order to spy or study the terrain ... all in the guise of mountain climbing,'' the command said in a statement. The statement said the foreigners included <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, New Zealander <PERSON> Trevor </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Smart </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The group apologized for the detention but said it was necessary for the `` best interest'' of the mountain climbers. `` To protect it -LRB- the area -RRB- from enemy troops, we had earlier installed various defense mechanisms, including booby traps and land mines in several strategic points of the mountain trail,'' it said. The rebel command said <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apo </ORGANIZATION> is part of rebel territory and any person entering the area should first ask for their permission. Tuesday's incident was reported to the military only Friday, said Maj. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Inciong </PERSON>, regional chief of the military's civil relations service. Among the detained Filipinos was the Rev. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Dimaranan </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic priest, <PERSON> Inciong </PERSON> added. The climbers who trekked to the mountain were attending the annual convention of the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountaineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Inciong </PERSON> said. The state-run <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the climbers were met by some 100 guerrillas near <LOCATION> Tudaya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> on the outskirts of the village of <LOCATION> Baracatan </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Negotiators at world trade talks on Saturday settled a dispute over textile exports and other issues that had held up a 2 -LCB- - year effort to liberalize global commerce, a spokesman said Delegates adopted the accord in a closed session, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, a spokesman for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said that `` a stalemate that has dogged the negotiations has been broken.'' Negotiators were deadlocked in efforts to achieve a major revision in the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> under the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round of talks, which began in 1986 and are to run through 1990. The accord reached Saturday will serve as a framework for further negotiations. <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> regulates world trade treaties and settles commerce disputes. The accord, signed by 100 countries, includes settlements of disputes over farm supports, textiles, intellectual property such as patents and safeguards against sudden surges in imports, officials said. Settlements in the other 11 areas of negotiations were reached in December at a meeting in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. On Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> announced it had reached an agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on the issue of farm supports. The settlement became possible after <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> dropped its insistence on the elimination of all farm subsidies. The agreement calls for an overall freeze on farm supports and import barriers through 1990. It calls for countries to reduce their subsidies in 1990 but does not specify by how much. Ms. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said she hoped the accord would result in a gradual correction in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade imbalance `` in the context of export expansion rather than import contraction. Under another agreement reached Saturday, delegates resolved <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> objections to earlier draft language that the 12-nation group said would remove textile and clothing barriers too rapidly. The agreement calls for further negotiations will be held later this month. Developing countries with large textile industries want liberal regulations. Industrialized countries such as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> members are concerned about the impact a lack of restrictions might have on domestic industries.

 An oil drilling platform with a 300-ton crane flipped over in heavy seas as it was being towed, but officials said Saturday the rig contained very little oil and there was no threat of a leak. No one was injured when The Five Sisters platform overturned Friday 65 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> on the edge of the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shelf </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Seth </PERSON> <PERSON> Tane </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the company in charge of the salvage. The platform was unmanned at the time of the accident, <PERSON> Tane </PERSON> said. `` I feel fairly certain the rig is salvageable,'' <PERSON> Tane </PERSON> said. He said he would work with <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> Diving and Salvage, a <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, company that worked in salvaging the tanker Exxon Valdez in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. High seas were preventing the salvage from beginning Saturday, he said.

He earlier had reported the vessel was carrying 10,000 gallons of fuel oil, and that there was danger of a spill. There has been no sign of oil in the water, <PERSON> Tane </PERSON> said. The platform resembles a huge cake pan with four legs that extend 95 feet into the air and 80 feet into the sea below. The legs can be extended to reach the floor of the sea for drilling operations. The platform was being towed by two tugboats from <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, where it was to be used in an underwater pipeline project, <PERSON> Tane </PERSON> said. On Friday, the tug captain released the 2 | - inch cables that bound the tugs to the platform because he was worried about the stability of his vessel amid 12 - to 14-foot seas The platform then overturned, <PERSON> Tane </PERSON> said. Stormy weather forced the submerged platform further out to sea late Friday.

The document names at least 40 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, incluing President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ then <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s vice president _ who were aware of the clandestine efforts to get assistance for the Contras, including during the 1984-85 period when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> blocked direct and indirect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the rebels, and into 1986 when only non-lethal aid was allowed. North's defense hinges on the argument he orchestrated the efforts at the orders of White House superiors. That proposition is bolstered by the court document, in which 107 points of fact are asserted. Those facts show the aid efforts took bizarre turns. Longtime enemies <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> were both approached to aid the Contras. Apparently the meeting with the representative of the Communist government was under <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> surveillance, because the document says the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was asked to keep its report on the meeting secret. In another apparent case of the government watching itself, the document said the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> `` learned of reports'' of a meeting between an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> government official and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON>, then undersecretary of state for political affairs, to discuss <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> help for the Contras. And <PERSON> North </PERSON> met with Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who offered to kill <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> leaders if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would help him clean up his image. North rejected the assassination proposal, but said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> might help in sabotage in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration later indicted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in connection with drug dealing. The court document's 107 points center on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration efforts to enlist other countries in the Contra effort. In particular, major pressure was applied to get <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s four closest neighbors _ <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> _ to provide arms, facilitate weapons deliveries and allow their territory to be used for support operations. Quid pro quo arrangements abounded. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, depicted as taking an active role in third-country solicitation, was told in February 1985 that <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> needed `` some enticements ... so that it would maintain its aid to the resistance,'' said a memo from then-National Security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>. Subsequently `` the president personally authorized the entire plan'' in which the Hondurans were to receive expedited economic aid and military assistance in exchange for helping the Contras, the court summary says. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is cited as an emissary from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, carrying word in March 1985 to then-President <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON> that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would speed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to his country. While <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was telephoning and sending messages to <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON> urging that he do all in his power to `` support those who struggle for freedom and democracy,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials publicly were sounding a different tone. They assured congressional hearings that the government view was that solicitation of third countries was illegal under the ongoing aid ban. Later in 1985, the Hondurans again were waffling, annoyed that they were being put upon. They were upset that promised <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid had not come through and were `` particularly angry that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> there had recently denied any connection with the resistance, referring inquiries to representatives of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>,'' the court summary said. By early 1986, the importance of getting Honduran cooperation for the secret Contra air resupply network led to plans for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to play a major role in pressuring the new president, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON>. The document does not say whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ultimately carried it out, but cites a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> memo prepared for a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> meeting with <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON>, with the Honduran expected to insist on getting `` clear economic and social benefits from its cooperation with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was to emphasize the importance of keeping the Contras strong, while <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> Adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> would meet privately with <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> to seek a commitment for Honduran support of the Contras, the document said. The late <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> also is depicted as playing a key role in bringing other countries into the Contra-aid business. In mid July of 1984, he told his deputy <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON> and Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dam </PERSON> that `` those present ought to get moving'' on non-U.S. funding for the rebels in light of Attorney Gen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s ruling that such fund-raising would not be an impeachable offense _ a fear that had been raised by then White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is now <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s secretary of state <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s ruling stated that third-country solicitation was acceptable only if there was no `` quid pro quo.'' As early as August of 1984, shortly after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> cut off <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the rebels, Secretary <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was proposing a plan to `` wink at lethal support for the resistance,'' according to the document. The idea was that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would give arms to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> which in turn would give arms to the contras. In his testimony to the congressional Iran-Contra investigating committees, however, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had said he opposed soliciting third countries that were major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid recipients. If Contra supporters were rewarded, then the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House took the opposite view of those who did n't cooperate. In the case of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, its new president <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> was a persona non grata in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after his government revealed in September 1986 the existence of the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elena </LOCATION> airstrip, which his predecessor had sanctioned for use by the Contra supply operation. North recommended cancellation of a planned <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> visit to the White House because of the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elena </LOCATION> disclosure. Conversely, <PERSON> North </PERSON> got <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to agree in March 1986 to pose for a `` photo opportunity'' with Costa Rican official <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Piza </PERSON>, who had arranged for construction of the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elena </LOCATION> airstrip. In 1986, the Guatemalans were seeking new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> recognition for their assistance to the Contras. After meeting with Guatemalan President <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> in September 1986, the court document says, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official informed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> `` that in return for <LOCATION> Guatemalan </LOCATION> support for the resistance, <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION> would ask Secretary of State <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to triple military assistance ot <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, to double economic assistance to <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, and to undertake other forms of support for <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>.'' North had recommended in March 1985 that additional military aid be sent to <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> `` as a means of compensating <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> for the assistance it was providing to the resistance,'' the court document said. <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> had a valuable role as provider of phony end user certificates that certified it was the recipient of $ 8 million worth of weapons shipments that actually were going to the rebels.

 If you want to find <LOCATION> Richwood </LOCATION> in the next few days, just follow your nose. It's the place that smells of ramps, the wild, odoriferous leeks whose spring harvest was celebrated Saturday. `` The total thing, it stinks,'' said <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowell </PERSON>, a patrolman for the <ORGANIZATION> Richwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and a ramp eater for all of his 42 years. `` You wanted to know the truth, did n't you?'' The festival is billed as `` The Feast of The Ramson'' and pays tribute to the strongly favored leeks that grow in the nearby mountains. About 1,000 pounds of ramps were harvested this year and boiled down Saturday for the annual feed. Two days of snow did n't deter thousands of out-of-staters flocking to the little town. `` There were piles of people. There were probably more people from out of state than there are in <LOCATION> Richwood </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Cowell </PERSON> said. `` Since the coal companies shut down, there's only about 3,300 people in <LOCATION> Richwood </LOCATION>.'' The ramps, served with ham, sausage, beans, cornbread and buttermilk in a meal at <ORGANIZATION> Richwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, emit a strong odor that's been called both pleasant and malodorous. All agree the scent is long-lasting. `` The smell will last in town for four or five days, and that's no joke,'' <PERSON> Cowell </PERSON> said He advised a home remedy _ frequent gargling with vinegar _ to clear the breath in only two days or so. He said he would begin gargling Saturday night.

 Sales of Challenger license plates have already paid for a memorial to the shuttle's seven astronauts and are helping to fund future trips to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>, state officials say. The design on the license plate features the space shuttle rising on an orange-and-white cloud into a blue sky. It was conceived in the months following the 1986 shuttle explosion in which the seven lost their lives. The plates, costing an extra $ 15, went on sale in January 1987. More than 500,000 people have bought or renewed the plates, bringing in $ 5 million in 1987 and about $ 4.5 million last year. The state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> designated a quarter of the money for scholarships and another quarter for the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> to research manned missions to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. The rest is going to build and maintain the memorial at the Kennedy Space Center. `` To bring in $ 5 million in one year from these tags, without any advertising or promotion, boggles my mind,'' says <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Everidge </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Astronauts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Titusville </LOCATION>. `` We had no idea the tags would take off like that.'' The $ 5 million memorial, to be inaugurated in October, is 50 by 40 feet and will rotate to follow the sun. The names of the seven Challenger astronauts, along with the three killed in the Apollo fire and four who died in training accidents, were etched by laser onto its reflecting surface. The monument will stand on raised ground in front of the visitors center near the entrance to the space center.

 Authorities on Saturday said at least three nurses killed dozens of patients with overdoses of insulin and other medication. <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Priessnitz </PERSON>, a senior police official involved in the investigation, told Austrian Television the nurses killed the patients for `` a kind of euthanasia.'' He said among those killed were patients they considered disagreeable. `` But the fact that they were most seriously ill always played a role,'' the official said, adding `` we have so far 30 to 32 cases of killing'' patients. Initial reports said the killings took place over the past year, but police gave no specific time frame. The three women were arrested for questioning Friday, and <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Boegl </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> police chief, said Saturday that they had confessed. <PERSON> Boegl </PERSON> said more people could be apprehended. No formal charges were filed by late Saturday. Euthanasia, a method of causing painless death, is advocated by some as a way to deal with people suffering from incurable painful diseases. <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Siska </PERSON>, head of the homicide squad, told Austrian radio earlier Saturday the killing of the patients at <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Lainz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> `` not only consisted of the administration of medication'' but did not elaborate. <PERSON> Priessnitz </PERSON> said a 30-year-old nurse was suspected of killing up to 20 patients.

 The Solidarity trade union said Saturday it will field opposition candidates for every available seat in the two-chamber parliament in the country's first free elections since World War II. Solidarity spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> said the list of candidates for the June elections should be ready by late April or early May. The candidates will run under the <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a group of more than 100 top union leaders and opposition intellectuals that has served as a policy council to <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> since December. They will have the full support of the independent trade union, a committee statement said. Solidarity has said it aspires to act solely as a trade union. Committee members say their group was formed as a separate political structure that shares the trade union's ideals. `` Solidarity will not organize the election campaign, it is not going to take part in elections, but is asking the Citizens' Committee to cultivate those open fields,'' <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> said Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> led the committee meeting in a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> church one day after the Sejm, or parliament, passed bills putting into law the economic and political agreements approved Wednesday by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and Interior Minister Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>. The accords ended two months of talks between authorities and the opposition. The laws legalize Solidarity _ banned since martial law was declared in 1981 _ set free elections and create the post of presidency. The new parliament will consist of a newly created 100-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the 460-member sejm. Elections to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will be freely contested. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and its allies will be assured 65 percent of the seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>, with 35 percent reserved for independent, non-party candidates. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, with majority control of parliamnet, also would hold the presidency. The Solidarity Citizens' Committee formed subcommittees to deal with campaign organization, access to radio and television, coordination of candidates, and election newspaper and finances. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> delivered a short speech to open the meeting, which lasted more than six hours. `` Thanking you for our common great political and public victory, let me ask you to make use of this victory so we can together choose some way of putting freedom into practice,'' he said. In the past, Solidarity called for boycotts of elections to express disapproval of government policies. The boycott appeals and public dissatisfication led to low voter turnouts and finally to public rejection of a government referendum on economic reform in November 1987. The opposition agreed to participate in elections in exchange for the restoration of Solidarity's legal status. Authorities first proposed talks with the opposition on political and economic reform during the a wave of nationwide strikes in August.

 Police placed a mosque under government control Saturday, one day after Moslem extremists clashed with police after attending a prayer service at the mosque.

He said <PERSON> Abdel-Rahman </PERSON>, spiritual leader of a fundamentalist group called Jihad that was blamed for <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s slaying, led Friday's noon prayers at the mosque and again urged worshipers to agitate against the government. After the service, <PERSON> Abdel-Rahman </PERSON> led a crowd of 300 to 400 worshipers from the mosque, <PERSON> Mahran </PERSON> said. Police opened fire and used batons and tear gas against more than 300 rioters after they fired pistols and hurled stones at police, <PERSON> Mahran </PERSON> said.

 A police union has erected signs around town to express its frustration with low pay and low morale in the city's police department. One sign reads: `` Welcome to St. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>. Home Of The Pony Express And One Of The Lowest Paid Police Depts. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Another says: `` <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joseph </LOCATION>, Where the <ORGANIZATION> Pony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Began </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Jesse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ended </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Where Law Enforcement Is Not A Priority.'' The signs were put up last week by the city's lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police. The group spent about $ 3,000 to launch the citywide sign and bumper sticker campaign. Police in the northwest <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> city of 76,000 have not had a raise in four years, said lodge President <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>. Starting pay for a patrolman ranges from $ 14,838 to $ 18,036, which <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said is below the pay for similar-size towns. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said that because of the low pay, morale is low and trained officers have looked for other jobs. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Euler </PERSON>, a city councilman, sympathizes with the officers but said the government does n't have the money. He has a sign at his office that says `` We support the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dept </ORGANIZATION>. in their efforts to obtain better salaries and benefits.'' <PERSON> Euler </PERSON>, who is chairman of a committee that oversees police department matters, said the lower salaries were caused partly by loss of federal revenue sharing and voter rejection of a city earnings tax. The city also has been forced to close two fire stations and curtail other city services, he said. `` The message is that <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joseph </LOCATION> residents ought to realize we have a serious problem,'' <PERSON> Euler </PERSON> said. `` We need additional revenue. ... There's no hidden box we can open and say, ` By golly, here's a few million dollars to spend.'''

 Shifting wind set oil from the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> on a collision course for the nation's No. 1 fishing port, while the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday sent a special team and equipment to help clean up the giant slick. Wind from the southeast and northeast pushed oil toward <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, 300 miles from the site of the nation's worst oil spill two weeks ago. The direction of the crude raised fears that the port town of <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION>, which last year had $ 166 million worth of catches, could be polluted within days, officials said. `` Geographically, <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> is downwind of the -LRB- oil -RRB- area if there are east winds,'' <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> meteorologist <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> said. The stricken tanker, meanwhile, was sitting dead calm in a flat sea Saturday with a half-dozen smaller boats clustered around it, steam drifting from its stack, a radar arm rotating and a helicopter on its deck. The Exxon Valdez is in a protected cove for emergency repairs. An orange boom designed to contain any leaking oil encircled the 987-foot tanker. In every direction beyond the boom, however, long streamers of congealed oil the color of chocolate milk drifted off for miles. On Friday, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would send federal troops to help with the cleanup and put the federal government virtually in control of the effort. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> insisted, however, that `` We are not federalizing this operation.'' The new federal authority was apparent Saturday as the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> began to move into a command center set up by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> in a Valdez office building. `` I think we had a problem with organization _ that's what frustrated everybody,'' said Rear Adm. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Alaskan </LOCATION> district. `` We now see a clean line of what's going to go on.'' Some <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> equipment was already arriving, including <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> skimmers and oil containment booms. A <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> `` assessment team'' made up of engineering, environmental, medical and logistical personnel from bases in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, assembled at the <ORGANIZATION> Alaskan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. It was scheduled to begin work Sunday. Meanwhile, however, confusion, complaints and equipment problems continued to characterize the cleanup. At <LOCATION> Sawmill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, where workers have been struggling for a week to hold oil away from four salmon hatcheries, a shipment of containment booms from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> turned out to be only half of the 16,000 feet promised, and only 24 inches deep instead of 41 inches. With favorable weather, however, 41-inch booms wo n't be necessary, <ORGANIZATION> Prince </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sound </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquaculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzumoto </PERSON> said. Fishermen and merchants of the nearby fishing community of <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> has been slow to process claims, including compensation for cleanup expenses and the loss of the $ 12 million herring season. `` <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON> remains a forgotten town,'' said R.S. <PERSON> Kopchek </PERSON>, a local fisherman. `` We are the people who are hurt the most.'' The Department of Fish and Game said oil has been spotted about five miles from <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON>, site of world's largest salmon hatchery. <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON> is about 50 miles wst of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, and north of <LOCATION> Sawmill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. Fish and game officials also announced that autopsies on two deer originally said to have been killed by oil showed one death caused by old age and the other by stress. In <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION>, officials have begun daily meetings to make contingency plans and have expressed concern that there wo n't be enough oil containment supplies left for that part of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. The state has transferred some managers of its cleanup at <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> to begin making preparations for a cleanup there. `` We're going to try to get down there and break it up if possible,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said authorities were sending herring boats with nets and <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutters with water cannons to try to break up the wind-driven oil before it reaches <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION>. The weather was better around <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. High pressure that has brought a week of favorable weather to the <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> area appears to be holding off encroaching fronts that threatened to blow oil into untainted shorelines and hatcheries. The wind pattern created by the high-pressure ridge has pushed much of the oil away from land and into the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, where it is more likely to break up. `` This has been miracle weather,'' said <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Cordova </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fishermen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>. Oil has already traveled over a 3,000-square-mile area. So far, only an estimated 16,000 barrels, about 7 percent of the 240,000 barrels spilled, has been sopped and vacuumed up. A barrel is 42 gallons. The disaster has killed thousands of birds and sea otters along the central Alaskan coast, cost fishermen millions of dollars in lost catch and continues to threaten valuable salmon fisheries. As the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> worked to set up its cleanup effort, others continued theirs. Though <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> officials had complained <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s handling of the cleanup was too bureaucratic and too slow, the oil company will continue to provide materials, manpower and money. Fishermen in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, who have spent the past two weeks defending four salmon fisheries, hoped to use new skimmers and booms to attack oil trapped in dozens of bays and inlets in the sound. `` The plan is to boom in the oil in places like <LOCATION> Snug </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> and Herring Bay and then bring in the skimmers to collect the oil,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Steiner </PERSON>, a state adviser to the <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON> fishermen's union. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Mertz </PERSON>, an assistant state attorney general, said a review of state and federal law indicates <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the operator of the trans-Alaska oil-pipeline terminal, could face fines exceeding $ 700 million as a result of the accident in which the Exxon Valdez rammed a reef. An environmental group in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> said Friday it had received the state's blessing to establish a fund to assist in the volunteer wildlife effort, and to monitor <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s cleanup progress. State officials issued an emergency order Friday to <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION>, directing it to correct problems with its oil-spill response program. `` <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> wo n't tolerate any more excuses for not responding to an oil spill, no matter what the size,'' Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said. The order requires <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> to replace a 12-member spill response crew disbanded several years ago, acquire by May 15 the best available equipment and prepare by June 1 a revised spill-contingency plan for state approval. <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> has seven days to respond. The company on Thursday announced its own new plans, which include tug boat escorts and random drug and alcohol testing.

 A former second mate under the fired <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> captain implicated in the Alaskan oil spill says the skipper was frequently drunk and failed to follow regulations, according to reports published Saturday. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Amero </PERSON>, who worked for <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> for eight years, has a $ 2.075 million lawsuit pending against <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state court charging that Capt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> and other superior officers harassed him. In a lengthy pretrial depostion given 18 months ago, <PERSON> Amero </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> `` constantly ... appeared to be intoxicated'' when he was in command of the vessel, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday. <PERSON> Amero </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> held regular drinking parties in his room on board ship, and added that he once saw <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> throw four empty quart bottles of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> whiskey overboard. `` There's a bad joke in the fleet that it's Captain <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> and his chief mate, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, that run the ship,'' he said in the deposition. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> was captain of the Exxon Valdez on March 24 when it crashed into a reef and spilled more than 10 million gallons of oil into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> in the nation's worst oil spill. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, 42, faces three misdemeanor charges in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> of operating a ship while intoxicated, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of oil. He is free on $ 25,000 bail after surrendering last week on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, where he lives. <PERSON> Amero </PERSON>, who now lives in <LOCATION> Meredith </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, also claimed that <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> `` falsified the deck logbook about fire and boat drills'' aboard his ships, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday. He told the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> newspaper in a telephone intereview that `` I smelled liquor on him on a number of occasions.'' The lawsuit, which charges that <PERSON> Amero </PERSON> was treated so badly that he needed psychiatric treatment, is pending. It seeks $ 2.075 million in personal injury damages from <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, charging that he was `` subjected to abuse and harassment by his superior officers and other supervisory employes, and in particular Capt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>.'' There was no answer Saturday at <LOCATION> Amero </LOCATION>'s home in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chalos </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>'s attorney, declined to comment on the lawsuit. On March 24, <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> allegedly turned control of the Valdez over to a third mate uncertified to pilot the vessel in the waters off <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. He was fired by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> on March 30 after the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said tests taken about nine hours after the disaster showed he was under the influence of alcohol. <PERSON> Amero </PERSON> said his problems with <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> began a week after he first began working under his command. `` I was asleep and he was jumping up and down on his floor one evening screaming at me to come up and drink with him,'' he said in the deposition quoted in The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>. He said he refused and that <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> began harassing him, and that a female seaman told him that she was sexually harassed by <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>.

 Two Sikhs charged with conspiracy in the 1984 assassination of Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> were arrested Saturday, police said. Police Commissioner <PERSON> Arvind </PERSON> <PERSON> Inamdar </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jagmohan </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>, 35, and <PERSON> Dalip </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, 55, both college lecturers in <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, were arrested at their homes. The men and three other Sikhs were charged Friday in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> court with waging war against the state, sedition, criminal conspiracy, murder and attempted murder. Two of the other Sikhs charged are in police custody and the third was killed in 1985 by rival Sikh militants. If convicted, the four still alive face a sentence of death by hanging. <PERSON> Inamdar </PERSON> said the five are accused of plotting Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s assassination and other `` sensational acts to create chaos, confusion and anarchy,'' as revenge for the June 1984 army raid on the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, the Sikhs' holiest shrine They also are accused of organizing the July 1984 hijacking of an <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> plane and plotting an abortive assassination of Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and her son <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> in September of that year. <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was elected prime minister after his mother's death. Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was shot and killed in the garden of her <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> residence by two Sikh bodyguards on Oct. 31, 1984. One of them was killed by other bodyguards and the second was convicted of murder and hanged. Another Sikh was convicted of conspircay in the murder and also hanged. The army raid on the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> was ordered by Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> to oust separatist Sikh militants entrenched in the shrine. At least 1,200 people, many of them Sikhs, died in the action. Sikh militants began fighting for a separate nation in 1982, citing discrimination by <PERSON> Hindus </PERSON>, who make up 80 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s population The campaign has worsened since Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s death. In 1988, at least 2,400 people were killed in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> and at least 480 have died so far this year. Sikhs form only 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 880 million people but are in a majority in the northern state of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, which borders <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Federal regulators have found the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> guilty of violating antidiscrimination laws in the cases of eight women faculty members, the college president said. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> concluded that the college unfairly failed to promote two female associate professors to the rank of full professor, according to a report released Friday by <ORGANIZATION> URI </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON>. The school was also cited for failures in the areas of granting maternity leaves, pay equity and job assignments in cases involving six other women teachers or administrators, the report said. <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> attributed the lapses to `` procedural errors'' and said remedies had been taken, including the promotion of the two women who had not been ranked as full professors. An investigation found that the university sought more letters of recommendation when reviewing one woman associate professor for promotion than it does for `` similarly situated males.'' It also determined the college did not develop an adequate maternity leave policy to ensure that women faculty would not be penalized for time away from work because of childbearing. `` These are procedural errors which occured,'' said <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON>. `` There's no clear and concise proof of any pattern of discrimination.'' But <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON>, faculty union president, said the report shows <ORGANIZATION> URI </ORGANIZATION> officials `` have n't unlearned their former practices,'' referring to a sex discrimination lawsuit against URI that was settled for $ 1.3 million in 1985. `` They're jerking people around, mainly women,'' he said. The 14-page report was the cullmination of a routine investigation of <ORGANIZATION> URI </ORGANIZATION>'s affirmative action policies. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Federal Contract Compliance undertakes such reviews when agencies are slated to receive at least $ 1 million in federal grants. If <PERSON> URI </PERSON> fails to comply with the report, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> could take steps to cut federal funds to the 13,000-student school. The grants total more than $ 30 million in research alone. <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> said pay adjustments totaling $ 6,365 have been awarded to five of the eight women involved and both associate professors cited in the report have been promoted, <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> said.

 Police in this small fishing town tried to determine Saturday why a masked gunman entered a courthouse annex and opened fire, killing a justice of the peace and wounding an assistant police chief. `` We're looking at three motives right now, but we have n't narrowed it down,'' Police Chief <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Gullett </PERSON> said Saturday He would n't elaborate. Justice of the Peace T.J. `` Jack'' <PERSON> Dooley </PERSON>, 79, was shot once in the heart in the attack at about 2:35 p.m. Friday. Assistant Police Chief <PERSON> Emmitt </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, 43, was shot in the upper chest but managed to return fire and kill the gunman. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> remained in serious condition in the intensive care unit of the <ORGANIZATION> Matagorda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> with a bullet lodged near his spine, <PERSON> Gullett </PERSON> said. The slain gunman was identified as <PERSON> Duc </PERSON> <PERSON> Nga </PERSON> <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON>, 27, from <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kan </PERSON>. He had lived in <PERSON> Palacios </PERSON> previously and was arrested in 1987 for carrying a pistol. Officials estimated <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> fired up to 20 shots during a gun battle that lasted only a few seconds. Residents of <PERSON> Palacios </PERSON>, 100 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, are puzzled over the shooting, <PERSON> Gullett </PERSON> said. `` The city is in shock. The Vietnamese community is in shock,'' he said. `` My phone was ringing off the wall at home last night. Many Vietnamese called my wife. Some called me. ... They are apologizing that this took place. The community as a whole is remorse.'' Authorities said <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> had been at the courthouse annex earlier in the day to get a driver's license but left when he was told they were issued only on Wednesdays. When he returned, his face was partly covered by a bandana and he held a Mauser automatic, which discharges bullets about the size of those from a .32 - caliber <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> also wore a backpack that, police later learned, contained adhesive tape, string and a device that could be used as a bomb detonator. The pack also contained three pairs of fake handcuffs, but no bomb, <PERSON> Hurta </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gullett </PERSON>, the police chief's wife who works for the county tax office and has a desk at the annex, said she knew there was something wrong as soon as <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> walked in. `` He yelled at me to stand up. I asked him what he said, and then the shooting started,'' she said. `` I ducked into a corner, hoping that the bullets would n't go through the wood.'' <PERSON> Dooley </PERSON> walked in as <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> grabbed <PERSON> Dwayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Koenig </PERSON>, 32, who was standing by the door, authorities said. <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> was telling <PERSON> Koenig </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Gullett </PERSON> to lay on the floor when <PERSON> Dooley </PERSON> approached them and was fatally shot. Mrs. <PERSON> Gullett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Koenig </PERSON> were unhurt. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> entered the tax office and ordered <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> to drop the gun. The gunman fired at the 13-year police department veteran, hitting him in the upper chest. But <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> managed to reload his .45 - caliber revolver and fire several times, striking the gunman in the head, arm and <PERSON> Dooley </PERSON> had been a justice of the peace for 12 years and was planning to travel to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, where he was to meet one of his two sons, <PERSON> Hurta </PERSON> said. The two were supposed to have an audience with the Pope.

 High pressure over <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> weakened Saturday and let ocean air move onshore, but temperatures still rose to record levels for early spring. One person apparently died from the heat. `` The beach is packed,'' lifeguard <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> DeGregori </PERSON> said as an estimated 100,000 people stretched out on <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> in soothing 77-degree air temperatures or took a cold plunge into the 64-degree water. `` The crowd is just unbelievable, you'd think it was the Fourth of July,'' said lifeguard Lt. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hargett </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Hermosa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, watching over part of an estimated 300,000 people lining the sands of the south <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. `` I had to look at the calendar just to make sure it was April,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> civic center temperature hit 89 at noon, tying the April 8 record high established in 1987. Downtown had a record-tying 100 on Tuesday and record highs of 105 Wednesday, 106 Thursday and 100 Friday. The heat contributed to the death of a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> woman, who was taken to a hospital with heat exhaustion and later died of a heart attack, police Sgt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Normandy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavaleta </PERSON>, 50, of <LOCATION> Boyle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, died Friday evening at White Memorial Medical Center, he said. In the desert, <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> baked in 106-degree heat and the town of Thermal fried at 105 by noon. Elsewhere, central and southern areas of the state had noon readings in the high 80s and 90s. The highest temperatures moved into the inland valleys and to the desert as the normal cooling sea breezes reasserted themselves and kept most of the coastal highs in the 70s, 80s and 90s rather than the triple-digit range. Throngs packed the beaches from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> throughout the week, and lifeguard agencies have had to call in their troops to handle crowds rivaling those of summer. `` This is an early start,'' <PERSON> DeGregori </PERSON> said. `` We do get some good -LRB- spring -RRB- weather, but this is something that you'd see in the first week of July and the end of June. `` Every day this week, and today is no exception, we've used every man available,'' he said. Lifeguards made hundreds of rescues during the week, <PERSON> Hargett </PERSON> said. Southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> beaches are still uneven from the winter waves, with deep holes lurking beneath the early spring surf, and riptides. `` We've had rips running 2, 3, 400 yards out, like a freight train grabbing people and yanking'em right out,'' <PERSON> Hargett </PERSON> said. Riptides run opposite to the ordinary flow and can pull people seaward. Downtown Los Angeles got the first indication of a return to normal when the overnight low fell to 67 by 5 a.m. Saturday, the first time the temperature had dropped below 70 since Tuesday.

 A Soviet flag fluttering over a paper factory made some employees see red, but organizers of a weekend visit to town by five <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> women said Saturday the flag was a friendly greeting. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> always runs up foreign flags for overseas visitors, said spokesman <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Rielly </PERSON>. <PERSON> Valentina </PERSON> <PERSON> Matvienko </PERSON>, vice mayor of <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> and leader of the delegation, said the women appreciated the gesture and were `` grateful to the citizens of Pine Bluff for their hospitality and friendliness toward our delegation.'' Employees circulated a petition Friday questioning the flying of the flag, but did not get a response from the plant's management. <PERSON> O'Rielly </PERSON> said he never saw a petition. Paper worker <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolls </PERSON> said it was upsetting to see the flag when he ended his shift Friday night. `` I do n't think there ought to be a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> flag flying over an American plant. I'm a veteran and I do n't like it. <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> is a communist country and we're not,'' <PERSON> Bolls </PERSON> said. Another employee, <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Yiengst </PERSON>, said she understood the gesture but did n't think it was necessary. `` I do n't think you'd see an American flag flying in their country,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Matvienko </PERSON> said that when Americans visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, `` we also greet them by putting up their flags and regard it as a sign of friendship.'' <PERSON> O'Rielly </PERSON> said the firm had flown the flags of delegations from other countries, including <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, when they toured the plant. The women had considered touring the mill on Saturday, but opted instead for shopping at a local mall, said <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> of the Soviet-American Women's Exchange, organizers of the Soviet women's 11-day tour of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> The decision had nothing to do with the workers' grumbling about the flag, Ms. <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> said she hoped the plant workers would look beyond differences between the two nations. `` I can understand that some people might feel the way they do, and that's the whole point of the trip _ for us to get to know each other on a person-to-person level,'' Ms. <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> said. `` The flying of the flag is certainly not a political statement. We are trying to create friendships.''

 Former President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueres </PERSON>, who in 1948 abolished <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>'s armed forces, is gravely ill in a local hospital and has received the last rites, his doctor said Saturday. Dr. <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> said the 83-year-old ex-president was admitted Friday night to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dios </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> after suffering severe chest pains. He said <PERSON> Figueres </PERSON> `` is in the coronary unit and we are afraid he might die.'' Another doctor, who asked not to be identified by name, said <PERSON> Figueres </PERSON>' condition was worsening. `` His heart can not take a pacemaker. His situation is worsening because he has a pulmonary infection and also has an inflamation in a vein in one of his legs,'' the doctor said. <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Casals </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic priest, told reporters at the hospital that he had delivered last rites to the man considered by many to be the father of democracy in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. Five of <PERSON> Figueres </PERSON>' six children and his two former wives were at the hospital along with some government officials, hospital sources reported. An adviser to President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said the president may cut short a trip to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> if <PERSON> Figueres </PERSON>' condition continues to worsen. In 1948, after allegedly fraudulent elections, <PERSON> Figueres </PERSON> went into the hills with a band of rebels and led a brief but bloody revolution that overthrew President <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> <PERSON> Guardia </PERSON> who had allied himself with the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Figueres </PERSON> took over as president of a provisional junta for a year, banning the communists and overseeing the writing of a new constitution that provided increased social services. He also abolished the armed forces, making <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> the only nation in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ and one of the few in the world _ without a military. Since then <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> has been <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most enduring democracy. <PERSON> Figueres </PERSON> served a second presidential term from 1953 to 1958 and a third from 1970 to 1974.

 A convicted drug dealer who feuded with a neighborhood grocer has been arrested and charged with masterminding the slaying of the outspoken anti-drug crusader, police said. <PERSON> Bobbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 29, was arrested Friday night and charged with one count of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted first-degree murder. One bystander was critically wounded and another managed to dodge bullets in the machine-gun attack outside <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>'s West Perrine grocery March 20. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, 51, died in a spray of 30 bullets that residents of <PERSON> West </PERSON> <PERSON> Perrine </PERSON> say came in retaliation for his outspoken efforts against drug dealers in the low-income community about 10 miles south of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Police also pursued the theory that the slaying was the latest in an ongoing drug-related feud. Less than a week before he died, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> reported to police a death threat. His family said it was <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> who threatened to kill the grocer. `` Mr <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> was in fact the party who paid the other subjects that were involved to kill Mr. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> police spokeswoman <PERSON> Lisette </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. Two men are already in custody and another suspect is still being sought. Metro-Dade Sgt. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> MacArthur </PERSON>, supervisor of the homicide investigating team, said he wo n't release the motive or the murder fee until the remaining suspect has been arrested. But he said late Friday that <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> contracted with <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Newsome </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> to kill <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>. <PERSON> Newsome </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, both 21, were arrested last week. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> has been charged seven times in five years with felonies, including a 1984 conviction in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> for possession of cocaine with intent to sell.

 A man armed with a pistol and rifle walked onto an elementary school playground and threatened a teacher and police officers, then shot himself to death, police said. A dispatcher said the <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> received a call at 7:10 p.m. Friday that an armed man was approaching the playground at <ORGANIZATION> Foothill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Police officers found the man walking among children and adults in the area and talked him into moving away from the crowd. Then, police said, the man threatened one of the officers with his rifle. `` In the midst of negotiations, with officers standing approximately 10 feet away from the suspect, the suspect turned the rifle on himself,'' the statement said. The man was pronounced dead at the scene, police said. His name had not been released late Saturday. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowcutt </PERSON>, a sixth-grade teacher at the school, said he and another teacher witnessed the shooting. `` It was a terrible thing,'' he said. `` -LRB- The police -RRB- did everything in their power to try to get him to give up the gun.'' <PERSON> Bowcutt </PERSON> said the man had turned a pistol on a female teacher and threatened her. The woman's husband then told him to take the gun off his wife, <PERSON> Bowcutt </PERSON> said. `` Then I grabbed the kids and she grabbed the kids and we took them into the -LRB- school -RRB- building into the classroom to get them away from the man,'' he said. <PERSON> Bowcutt </PERSON> said there were about 10 children in the area, as well as several adults when the man arrived at the school. Three times in the past year, adults with guns have killed elementary schoolchildren in seemingly random attacks.

 Would-be scientists who took a wrong turn on the road to enlightenment wound up in their own little corner at the mecca of knowledge known as <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION>, enshrined in the <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Useless </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. The archives, a compendium of crackpot theories also known as the `` nut collection,'' preserve 200 books, drawings and pamphlets by brave laymen who sought to explain things like `` Why Life Exists and Allied Subjects.'' But archivist <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquis </PERSON> says the weird science does n't entirely clash with the serious science at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, since both stem from people's desire to explain their existence `` We want to collect basically not only what worked but what did n't work,'' she said. At least two of the theorists from the 1920s,'30s and'40s were borne out by later scientists, warning that cigarette smoking could be linked to cancer. But it's the really useless that dominates, not the musings of the ahead-of-their-time, misunderstood geniuses. There is <PERSON> Cyrus </PERSON> <PERSON> Teed </PERSON>, who advanced the theory that people are living inside <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. And there is <PERSON> Seabury </PERSON> <PERSON> Doane </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON>, who determined that the sun is actually 600 miles away from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, as opposed to the 93 million miles generally accepted by astronomers. Titles of the mainly self-published works are ambitious. `` The Fact of All Life,'' `` Beyond <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>,'' `` Why Life Exists and Allied Subjects,'' are among the sticky issues bravely tackled. Explaining the meaning of life is a key theme of the authors, along with debunking scientific beliefs such as the existence of gravity, and finding proof for religious beliefs. `` My own theory is these are the same kind of people who in another circumstance might have found their one answer in religion,'' <PERSON> Marquis </PERSON> said. `` I think that's a lot of what drives science anyway. We want to know why.'' The collection was donated to <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> by an editor of Scientific American. It also includes crank mail sent to <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> scientists over the years, <PERSON> Marquis </PERSON> said. Most of the authors take a bombastic approach. But some are more modest, such as <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sowell </PERSON>, who titled his 1938 work `` A Layman's Guess or The <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theory </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Sowell </PERSON> noted he lacked scientific training and admits that some might think him presumptuous. `` However, there is an impelling desire on my part to do this,'' he wrote. The `` impelling desire'' to explain the unexplainable is an integral part of science, <PERSON> Marquis </PERSON> said. `` The successful guys think about impossible things and try to explain them,'' she said. `` These guys just kept thinking about impossible things.''

The pump, however, assists rather than replaces the heart. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> was hospitalized Nov. 21 with ischemic cardimyopathy, a degenerative condition that prevents his heart from pumping enough blood. On Nov. 25, a team led by Dr. O.H. <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> implanted the air-powered heart assist pump into his abdomen.

 City officials asked a court to declare the <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> refinery here a public nuisance following a series of mishaps that have killed three people and injured dozens since 1987. The lawsuit, filed Friday in <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, alleges the `` potential for massive disaster'' at the 750-acre refinery, with the city especially fearing the uncontrolled release of toxic hydrofluoric acid. The complaint asks the court to bar <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> from polluting the air with the acid and other toxic chemicals and order the company to safely operate the refinery in southern <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The facility produces about 12 percent of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s gasoline Officials in this city of 140,000 people did not say in detail what actions they might take if the court issued such an order. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> officials had not seen the lawsuit late Friday and declined to comment on the specific allegations. Scientists say a 1,000-gallon hydrofluoric acid spill could produce a lethal toxic cloud capable of spreading over a five-mile range. The lawsuit was the city's latest attempt to respond to a series of fires, explosions and other problems that have claimed three lives at the refinery since 1987. A consultant's report in January blamed carelessness and lax management for what it called an `` unacceptable'' number of problems at the facility since 1987. In November, the federal government cited <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> and nine of its contractors for 100 safety violations and recommended fines totaling $ 30,040. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> officials are contesting the federal findings.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The military government of Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> said Saturday that loyal troops crushed a mutiny after two days of fighting and that most of the rebel soldiers were captured. `` The soldiers of the Presidential Guard presently occupy the <ORGANIZATION> Dessalines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barracks </ORGANIZATION>,'' said a statement issued by the army adjutant, Gen. <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean-Pierre </PERSON>, and read on state-run radio. It said most of the rebels in the barracks were captured but some fled and left behind their uniforms and weapons. The communique did not say how many rebels were captured or had escaped. The normal force of the <ORGANIZATION> Dessalines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barracks </ORGANIZATION> is 750 soldiers. Loyal soldiers shelled the barracks Friday night and resumed the artillery bombardment Saturday morning. There also were firefights in the area of the barracks, which adjoin the National Palace in the center of <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>. Casualty figures for Saturday's fighting were not available. A source close to the government said 17 soldiers, all thought to be rebels, were killed in Friday's fighting. Haitians monitoring military radio broadcasts said reports indicated the Presidential Guard suffered 15 casualties but there was no breakdown of dead and wounded. The state hospital said at least one civilian was killed Friday and unconfirmed reports put the civilian death toll at three. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> said it was believed two Presidential Guard soldiers were killed Saturday. `` The casualty figures apparently are going to be lower than the level of noise might have indicated,'' she said. <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> remained calm after the government claimed victory. Its communique said the captured rebels implicated drug traffickers in efforts to overthrow <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> that began April 2 with an attempted coup. It said an anti-government plot was organized by Haitian exiles formerly associated with the ousted regime of dictator <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>. The statement also claimed the mastermind of the revolt was former Interior Minister <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Lafontant </PERSON>, who is now living in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, which shares the island of Hispaniola with <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. The statement was issued at 5:15 p.m. EDT after several hours of heavy shelling of the barracks. Shooting had tapered off shortly before the announcement. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said earlier that a hole was blown in the roof of the gleaming white National Palace, which serves as the presidential residence. It was believed the damage was caused by a mortar shell fired about a mile away by rebels who fled the barracks Friday night and took over a Roman Catholic church compound. Diplomats had said Friday night it appeared <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>'s troops had gained the upper hand and driven the rebels from the compound. But fierce firefights broke out again Saturday. Reports Saturday morning said members of the Leopards commando unit who had been involved in the mutiny were seen removing their uniforms. Witnesses said they abandoned their base in the capital's suburbs There were no reports of fighting elsewhere in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. The rebels accuse <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>'s government, which took power in a military coup six months ago, of favoritism toward the Presidential Guard in pay and living conditions. They also said the government was arbitrarily dismissing senior officers in a U.S.-supported crackdown on drugs and corruption. In the attempted coup on April 2, rebel soldiers seized <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> and took him to the airport for deportation but he was rescued by loyalist soldiers. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> went on television Monday to claim the rebellion had been put down. However, rebel soldiers continued to roam the capital, clashing with government forces. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, 50, came to power in September 1988 in a coup by non-commissioned officers that ousted Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>. The officers demanded democratic reform and an end to state-sponsored violence. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> had deposed a short-lived civilian government. He had earlier led a junta that took over after <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> was swept from power in a popular uprising and fled to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in February 1986. The government blamed the attempted coup earlier this month on people opposed to both democratic change and a `` campaign against drug trafficking, contraband and corruption.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has made the drug crackdown a condition for restoring $ 70 million in aid that it suspended after thugs massacred 34 voters in November 1987, thwarting <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s first free elections in more than 30 years.

 An angry group of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> service station owners filed suit against the oil giant, charging that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s manipulative practices take profits from dealers and saddle consumers with high fuel prices The 19 Exxon dealers, most from the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> area, charged the nation's largest oil marketer with 15 counts of civil violations of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> antitrust and deceptive trade practices laws. The lawsuit was filed Friday in state district court. A spokesman for the dealers' group said the action was unrelated to the <LOCATION> Exxon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> oil disaster in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. `` We finally had enough of it, and we're fighting back,'' said the spokesman, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> dealer <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. An <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman did not answer a telephone call from The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday. The lawsuit seeks more than $ 5 million in actual damages and unspecified punitive damages. Hall and his fellow dealers complained that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> favors select franchises with `` sweetheart'' rents, interferes with dealers' ability to buy gasoline cheaper from wholesalers and has rigid rules for the inheritance of dealers' stations when they die <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> is the second oil company sued by its dealers in the last six months. Last September, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> was hit with a suit on a separate set of complaints by a band of dealer franchises in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> federal court. `` Is this the last of this type of suit you're going to see?

 Preliminary laboratory tests showed nothing to indicate that a nuclear-powered Soviet submarine released radiation after it caught fire and sank, Norwegian scientists said Sunday. Early results of tests for radioactive contamination in air and surface water samples from the accident area showed no radiation from the sub, the government's <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radiation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. `` These tests checked to see if the Soviet sub released radiation on or near the surface of the ocean, but can not exclude the possibility of such a leak deeper in the ocean,'' said researcher Per Strand of the institute. He said the tests will continue. They involve examining scrapings from Norwegian Orion reconnaissance aircraft that flew in the region immediately after the accident Friday and seawater collected near the site. A Norwegian research vessel on Sunday will take new samples from deeper waters to assess the possibility of the sub having emitted radiation as it sank towards the seabed, <PERSON> Strand </PERSON> said. Norwegian military officers said the submarine caught fire and went down in international waters 120 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bear </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and about 310 miles west of <LOCATION> Tromsoe </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s northern As many as 50 crew members may have died, officials said. Defense Minister <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> Joergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Holst </PERSON> said he believed the risk of radiation contamination was slight. Soviet officials said there was no danger of contamination. They confirmed there were deaths but did not provide casualty figures or details about the explosion, the third serious Soviet sub accident in 2 -LCB- years. The vessel, one of the Soviets' most advanced, was capable of carrying more than a dozen long-range missiles, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. <PERSON> Vadime </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosanov </PERSON>, Soviet press attache in <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>, told Norwegian television the sub was carrying only torpedoes, but he declined to say whether the vessel was equipped with any nuclear weapons. The ship normally carries a crew of about 95. From observations by a Norwegian reconnaissance air crew, the Norwegian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> estimated 40 to 50 men were picked up by Soviet vessels, and it was unclear if all survived. `` It's a matter of mathematics,'' said Maj. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>, a military spokesman. `` You have a potential of 50 or more'' who died. The submarine reportedly caught fire while submerged. A Norwegian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement said that after the ship surfaced the fire spread from one section to several others and set off an explosion. The ship then began to list and sink. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> assured <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> the vessel's reactor was shut down before it sank and that there was no risk of radiation. `` According to the opinion of experts, the possibility of a nuclear explosion and radioactive pollution of the environment is excluded,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> wrote in a message to Prime Minister <PERSON> Gro </PERSON> <PERSON> Harlem </PERSON> <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON>. He sent similar messages to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the sub sank in water more than 4,500 feet deep. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted Defense Minister <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> as saying survivors were taken on board a Soviet warship that was bound for the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Murmansk </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Thorvald </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON>, criticized the Soviet failure to quickly inform <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> of the accident. `` It's clear that the information came too late,'' <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said in a radio interview. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the fire broke out at 11:41 a.m. Friday and the sub sank about 5 -LCB- hours later. A Norwegian spokesman said <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> was officially told of the accident nearly nine hours after the sinking and only after the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> contacted the Soviet Embassy. The Vienna-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the Soviets notified it of the sub accident early Saturday and that the Soviets said there was no danger of a nuclear explosion or radioactive contamination. Soviet officials were criticized for not providing accurate or timely information after the April 26, 1986, explosion and fire at the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear power plant that sent a cloud of radiation into the atmosphere, contaminating crops and livestock in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said the sub apparently belonged to a type nicknamed `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>.'' If that is correct, the ship was launched in 1983 and was built to carry 16 long-range missiles. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Beaver </PERSON>, an expert with <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> that the sub was highly advanced. `` As far as we can see, it's a new design which is there to test propulsion systems, sensor systems, weapon systems and even hull design. It's really a prototype for what has come after it,'' he said. The accident was in strategic waters frequented by the Soviet and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> navies. For the Soviets, the waters are the exit route of its massive <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>, stationed on the <LOCATION> Kola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Barents </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Foreign Policy Report to Bush Recommends No Major Initiatives Regarding
Soviet Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A major foreign policy report to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> advises no major new initiatives toward the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, an administration official said Saturday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked his advisers to `` take another look another time at the whole situation'' after receiving recommendations on relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> relations, said the official. The trio of reports are part of a major foreign policy review <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> initiated as he took office in January. In relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, `` I do n't see anything new,'' the official said, adding that there apparently was `` not much to change right now.'' The reports were given to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during meetings of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> over the past 10 days, the official said. The reports recommended some changes, including new measures involving an easing of pressure on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the official said, adding that regarding <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the most likely option was to break off diplomatic relations with the government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The official did not give further details. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in Sunday's editions that the president's advisers suggested that he maintain a middle course allowing him to view the policies of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> skeptically while responding with some bold foreign policy initiative of his own. The administration experts recommended a `` status-quo plus'' stance toward the many changes occurring under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the Times said. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said in its Sunday editions that the three reports determined that the administration should closely follow current policies toward <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> set by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported that some senior administration officials expressed frustration with what they considered a complacent view of world affairs reflected in the reports. However, it said other officials praised the process that produced the reports, saying they were less rancorous than interagency meetings conducted during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. One official said the report on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> urged that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy `` should not be designed either to help or hurt'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. The Times said the classified analyses were prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the Pentagon and the staff of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. They concluded that changes in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would continue throughout the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration even if <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> were replaced with another Soviet leader, the Times reported. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and some of his top assistants, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adviser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scowcroft </ORGANIZATION> and Deputy Security Adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, have been skeptical of some of the changes in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But that approach has been criticized by some experts as too cautious at a time when the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is undergoing monumental change that could dramatically alter American-Soviet relations, the Times reported. `` The real debate in the administration will be between the two centrist positions _ the stand-pat school and the seize-the-opportunity school,'' Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., told the Times The report to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> suggested that the president could pursue dialogue for the two superpowers to combat terrorism jointly and slow the spread of chemical weapons, the Times said.

<HEAD>Democrat Readies Ethics Complaint Against Gingrich</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Democrat circulated an ethics complaint among his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> colleagues Friday charging <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Minority Whip <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> with nine alleged violations of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules. The complaint, drawn up by Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, will be filed formally with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee early next week, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. Committee members were given advance copies of the complaint Friday, he said. Under House rules, the formal filing of such a complaint by <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> will force the ethics committee to take a vote on whether to launch an investigation of <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Republican. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s action was seen as the beginning of a Democratic counteroffensive against <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, who last year filed the ethics complaint that resulted in a lengthy investigation of Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. The ethics committee, known formally as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Official </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION>, is nearing the conclusion of its investigation of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and is expected to decide as early as next week whether to charge him with violations of House rules. The nine allegations in <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s complaint center on an unusual promotional deal for <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s 1984 book, `` Window of Opportunity.'' Details of the deal were disclosed last month, just before <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans elected <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> to their number two leadership position. On Friday, <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said the complaint was `` clearly another Democratic smear, and in this case a pathetically, poorly done one.'' He said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s complaint was poorly researched and riddled with factual errors. `` It is certainly Mr. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s right to file with the ethics committee,'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said. `` In this case, it so clearly is an unresearched and unprepared document, and it so clearly demeans and distorts the ethics process that I hope that respectable and responsible Democrats will intervene.'' The deal involved 21 investors who put $ 5,000 each into a partnership formed to promote the book. In return for their investment, the partners were promised half the publisher's profits, but the publisher ended up losing money on the book and the investors got a tax writeoff <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Marianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, who co-authored the book, has said she received less than $ 10,000 of the $ 105,000 raised by the partnership for arranging the deal and coordinating the promotional effort. She also received a $ 26 tax benefit from her share of the partnership. Mrs. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said last month that the ethics committee had been consulted before the partnership contracts were signed to ensure that the arrangement did not violate any House rules. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> contends in the complaint that the promotional deal may have violated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules limiting outside earned income and gifts that a member can receive. He said the deal also may have violated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules governing the use of campaign funds and government resources and requiring disclosure of travel reimbursements.

 Singer-songwriter <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Moody </PERSON>, a former Grand Ole Opry regular whose country music career spanned five decades, died in a <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> hospital Friday. He was 74. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION> had been in and out of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> for treatment of an aortic aneurysm, but never fully recovered from surgery several weeks ago to correct the problem, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Missy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubner </PERSON>. `` He performed the night he went to the hospital.

<UNK>Three U.S. Servicemen Discover Suspected Rebel Bomb Trap</UNK>

 Three American soldiers found what was believed to be a communist rebel bomb trap on a road near <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said Friday. Capt. <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Eggleston </PERSON> said the servicemen detected the suspected trap Thursday in the village of <LOCATION> Sapang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bato </LOCATION> when they found a wire running across a road that leads to a firing range near the base. The base, run by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, is about 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> met with a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation evaluating human rights in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and said she regretted that her government's rights record was viewed as no better than that of <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. In the southern <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest and a village official were shot to death by a soldier, church officials said. Ms. <PERSON> Eggleston </PERSON> said the American soldiers were on their way to the firing range when they spotted the wires on the road and turned back to report their discovery to base authorities. When American and Filipino troops went to the area, they found that the wires had been removed. Local police said the incident could have been a rebel plot since members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> operate in the area. In October 1987, communist rebels killed two American soldiers, a retired <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> soldier and a Filipino of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> descent in almost simultaneous attacks near <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. There had been no attacks on Americans since then. In <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Teodoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> told a group of attorneys from <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> that her government's human rights record has improved despite criticism that violations are similar to those under <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' 20-year rule. The lawyers were completing a 12-day tour of the country. `` The fact is we have restored democracy and that is the most important factor,'' she said. <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON>, in a telephone interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, agreed. `` She reaffirmed her own commitmnet to human rights, but I think the problem is how to translate this commitmnet to the lower levels of the government out in the field,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and other human rights groups have accused the military of continued human rights violations during Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s administration. On <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> island, the Rev. <PERSON> Dionisio </PERSON> <PERSON> Malalay </PERSON> and a village councilman were gunned down Thursday in the town of <LOCATION> Tabina </LOCATION>, about 520 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, a church official in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> said. The Rev. <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Calaar </PERSON> said <PERSON> Malalay </PERSON> was talking with councilman <PERSON> Rufino </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> when a Philippine Constabulary soldier and a militiaman passed by and started an argument with <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>. Malalay tried to intervene and the soldier shot him, <PERSON> Calaar </PERSON> said. The militiaman then shot <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, he said.

 A former city attorney was sentenced Friday to 90 days in jail and four ex-commissioners got two years' probation on convictions for guaranteeing themselves jobs in settling a federal voting-rights lawsuit In addition to the jail sentence, attorney <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was fined $ 5,000, said <ORGANIZATION> Vermilion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> DeArmond </PERSON>. `` He was the prime mover in the conspiracy,'' he said, `` the guy who orchestrated the whole thing.'' Former commissioners <PERSON> Wilbur </PERSON> <PERSON> Scharlau </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> each were sentenced to two years' unsupervised probation, fined $ 1,000 each and forfeited their pension rights and jobs with the city. The sentences were handed down by Circuit Judge <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Komada </PERSON>. But the penalties were stayed and the defendants released on bond pending appeal of the case, <PERSON> DeArmond </PERSON> said. The men were convicted in February of conflict of interest, conspiracy and violation of a municipal code that bars entering into a contract for personal gain. All but <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> also were convicted of official misconduct. The case stems from a 1987 lawsuit filed under the federal Voting Rights Act. The parties reached a settlement that guaranteed the commissioners city jobs for three years after the city adopted a new form of government. The lawsuit alleged that <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>'s longtime mayor-commissioner form of government discriminated against blacks. The city held at-large elections of the commissioners who headed city departments and formed the City Council. Under the settlement, council members represent newly outlined city wards. Aldermanic elections were held in December 1987 and two blacks were among those elected _ the first blacks to serve on the council since the old system was adopted 60 years earlier. The settlement also specified that <PERSON> Scharlau </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> would have jobs as department heads for three years in the new system.

 Crews tackling the worst oil spill in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history got good news from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on who's in charge of the cleanup and bad news from a weather forecast that could put untainted shoreline in jeopardy.

 Activists were thronging to the nation's capital today for a demonstration that organizers hope will cement public opinion once and for all in favor of a woman's right to an abortion March leaders say the demonstration on Sunday will launch a campaign that includes nationwide distribution of a videotape aimed at countering the anti-abortion movement's trademark video, `` Silent Scream.'' The 20-minute videotape `` Abortion: For Survival'' includes footage of a woman undergoing an abortion to show the procedure is `` safe and simple'' and the indiscernible remains taken from the uterus in a first-trimester abortion. The videotape `` puts it where it's at,'' said <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Smeal </PERSON>, president of the Fund for the Feminist Majority. `` It talks about abortion as a public health necessity and essential for the well-being of millions of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women.

 From the jeweled party dresses of peasants to <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> the Great's homemade boots, historical fashions from imperial <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> are being shown in an exhibition from <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hermitage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> put on by <PERSON> Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> Saint </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON>. Until May 31, Parisians will be able to view 200 costumes, 46 paintings and nine engravings covering <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>'s prerevolutionary period from 1700 to 1914. The Jacquemart-Andre Museum, formerly a dingy mansion, has been refurbished to shine as splendidly as the czar's Winter Palace. Saint <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON>, who was honored with his own fashion retrospective in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> two years ago, was also celebrating the 225th anniversary of the Hermitage Museum. `` This is a great example of glasnost,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Pietri </PERSON>, the American curator of the show, referring to the `` openness'' policy of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` Several years ago we would n't have been able to get seven court dresses as we did this time,'' he said. `` The Russians are justifiably proud of these well-preserved costumes. They have done a fabulous job of preserving their heritage.'' A small room devoted to <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON>, who made <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> -LRB- now <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> -RRB- into an 18th-century imperial city, displays several outfits that clothed the 6-foot-9 czar, a giant with sloped shoulders. He might have worn the splendid red and blue cavalry dress outfit during the battle of Poltava as he beat a path to water, opening up land-locked <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> to the sea. Standing alone, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>'s plain homemade boots bear witness to his do-it-yourself creativity as a young man who built boats as well as boots to escape boredom before he came to power. Among the imperial costumes of <ORGANIZATION> Catherine </ORGANIZATION> 1, who plotted and succeeded in marrying <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> the Great, were two outfits for reviewing the troops. One was green, for the <ORGANIZATION> Preobrajenski </ORGANIZATION> order, named after a hero, another red and blue equestrian outfit for passing the cavalry in review. Unlike her towering husband, <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON>, who was empress only two years -LRB- 1725-27 -RRB-, was short and fat, wearing a big cloak to cover up most of her girth. The Russian love of Oriental opulence is woven throughout the show, with silver and gold threads, amazing brocade embroidery, iridescent taffetas, jet beads, sequins and pearls. Red velvet, always a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> favorite, is shown generously throughout. But the enormous rubies, emeralds and amethysts the Russian royals lavished on themselves have now been replaced by glass stones. Only in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> could one find the exquisite antique shawls on view, woven so finely in stained-glass colors that the threads are barely perceptible. The price was heavy for the young girls who wove the fabrics, who often went blind. Yet the French fashion influence is obvious as well. `` Peter the Great decreed that European styles would be worn at court,'' said <PERSON> Isabelle </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Courreges </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Saint <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON>. `` Everything about dressing was decreed, even the length of the trains.'' Many of the 19th-century outfits are nearly line-for-line copies of what Parisians were wearing, from high-waisted French empire styles to crinoline skirts and bustles. One tableau of `` The Imperial White Nights'' is a stunning succession of gossamer-light silvery embroidered dresses. Going along with the modern dawn-to-dark philosophy, are two convertible dresses with separate tops, circa 1880. The daytime versions sport frothy jabots for modesty at the the neck, while the evening tops have daring decolletages. The show's mannequins are given an amazingly lifelike appearance with period curls and coifs fashioned out of stiffened `` silk paper,'' the work of two Parisian hair stylists. While women might envy the extraordinary beauty of the elaborate dresses, men could covet some of the marvelous silk dressing gowns worn in off-hours. Outfits from the top Russian couturiers <PERSON> Lamanova </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brissac </PERSON> and <PERSON> Boulbenkova </PERSON> are displayed alongside models by <PERSON> Poiret </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, favorite <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> designers at the turn of the century. Children are not forgotten in the show. A lavish silver-embroidered salmon pink velvet suit was a gift of <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> to her adored grandchild, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Touching </PERSON> outfits for children that might have been worn by <PERSON> Anastasia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alexis </PERSON> _ offspring of the last Czar <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> _ are just as elaborate as the grown-ups' clothes: a short silvery dress for the little girl, an embroidered blue velvet suit for a boy. A group of peasant `` fete'' dresses topped by cockscomb `` kokoschnik'' -LRB- halo-headdresses -RRB- is just as rich-looking as the court styles, though with informal touches such as gay sashes and suspenders with lace-trimmed `` sarafan'' or apron dresses. The glittery folklore was reminiscent of the `` rich and happy peasant'' styles admired by Saint <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON>, and the inspiration for his 1976 Ballets Russes collection.

<HEAD>Tough To Read Tea Leaves In Murky Concoction Of Economic Stats</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Forecasters gazing into their crystal balls say the economic picture is still fuzzy but they have started to get an image of how people are reacting to rising interest rates. A few businesses probably do n't like what they've seen so far. Car makers and big retail merchants furnished figures this past week that cast shadows of doubt about their situations. Sales of cars and trucks in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> skidded an unexpectedly steep 18.3 percent in late March, auto manufacturers reported, and many retailers did n't ring up as much business last month as they had thought they would. The news was unsurprising given the direction interest rates have taken lately. Expensive purchases normally financed with loans _ like cars _ were predicted to shrink as consumers became obliged to spend more on things such as mortgage payments. So widely anticipated was the spending slowdown that the nation's Big Three automakers cranked up their promotional vehicles before the latest results were even in. They have been touting rebates and cut-rate financing deals, including <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s zero percent financing, to tempt customers back into the showrooms during the important spring car-buying season. Historically, March and April are the months when shoppers gear up for extra summertime driving by paying a visit to dealerships. Many may have stopped by to browse in late March but fewer than usual bought. Conventional wisdom says the incentives will breathe some oomph into auto sales, but after a short while they'll lose gusto again once bargain-hunters have had their fill. When many of nation's major retailers toted up March sales they were disappointed. Some blamed bad weather or the fact that they had one less selling day in this year's five-week period than they had last year _ which can make a big difference. Retail industry analysts agreed with those points. But in sifting through the numbers they came up with evidence that consumers are losing enthusiasm to spend money on the types of things they bought in abundance during much of the six-year economic expansion. `` I think we have a fundamental switch in consumer spending,'' says <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist at the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Consumers are spending more on services, such as travel, recreational pastimes or personal health and fitness plans `` The kind of items bought at the chain stores are less prominent in the consumer basket these days,'' according to <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>. A calculation by the securities firm <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> indicated sales of specialty apparel, hard goods such as home furnishings, and other general merchandise, rose just 4.6 percent in March, down from February's 7.6 percent growth. In order words, sales barely kept ahead of inflation. Retailers are justifiably reluctant to generalize based on only one month's performance. The transition from winter to summer can be an unsettled time for the weather, so shoppers frequently do n't buy clothes to freshen up their wardrobes or get new gardening gear, for instance, until they're sure warm temperatures have come to stay April could be a cruel month for car makers and general merchandisers if customers do n't act on the traditional weather cue and go out shopping. In other business and economic news this past week: _ The government reported what was desribed as an ambiguous set of statistics about the labor market The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the unemployment rate fell to 5 percent in March, a new 15-year low, from 5.1 percent the month before, even though the number of new jobs added to the economy fell to the smallest amount since August. _ <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> agreed to be acquired by an investor group led by former baseball commissioner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> for about $ 464 million But the deal, which would give <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s 30,000 employees a 30 percent stake in the airline, wo n't become final until after parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> brings Eastern out of federal bankruptcy protection, among other things. _ As junk bond enthusiasts capped an annual get-together in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and toasted <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s pioneering efforts in the high-yield, high-risk business, the former head of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION>'s junk bond operation pleaded innocent at his arraignment in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> federal court on a raft of racketeering and securities fraud

<HEAD>Another Inflation Test Awaits Wall Street</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 In a stock market intensely focused on economic statistics, `` producer prices'' are the magic words for the coming week on Wall Street. The government is due to report Wednesday on the March producer price index for finished goods. Stock and bond traders will be watching closely to see whether the index, a measure of inflationary pressures at the next-to-last point in the distribution chain, shows signs of letting up. Increases of 1 percent in the index for both January and February shook up the markets when they were reported, and fanned fears of increasing inflation and higher interest rates. `` The index is the most worrisome inflation indicator at this time,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Letter </ORGANIZATION> observed. `` Another large increase could prompt further credit-tightening moves by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>.'' If advance estimates by private economists are right, a measure of relief is on the way. The consensus view is that the increase for March will be down to about half a percentage point _ still a bit high, perhaps, but at least moving in the right direction. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenbaum </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which is looking for a gain of either 0.4 percent or 0.5 percent, says the expected improvement lies mainly in food and energy prices, which were primary culprits in the increases of the two previous months. The adverse price effects of the oil spill near <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, wo n't show up in producer prices until the April figures are out, he said. Of course, there are no guarantees against an unpleasant surprise. The February figure came in well above expectations. But whatever the ups and downs of the figures over the next month or two, many economists argue that inflation is likely to subside significantly as the year passes. `` We think the stage is being set for a deceleration of inflation later in 1989,'' said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Applegate </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Tucker </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Anthony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; R.L. <ORGANIZATION> Day </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The recent inflation figures, while certainly worse than expectations, are also history. They lag, not lead.'' <PERSON> Applegate </PERSON> points out that such traditional early-warning indicators of inflation as the price of gold and the growth rate of the money supply are sounding no alarms at all. He also observed that the stock market has risen, on balance, since the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> began to tighten credit a year ago, suggesting at least a cautious belief that the central bank might succeed in restraining inflation without inflicting severe pain on the economy. In the past week, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 11.18 points to 2,304.80. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index gained 1.40 to 166.93; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market added 3.98 to 410.71, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index was up 2.28 at 330.59. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 166.93 million shares a day, against 146.91 million the week before. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON>, economist at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, says he believes the rise of 3 percentage points in short-term interest rates over the past year is `` starting to bite. But we do n't expect a recession. `` Rather, we believe that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s aggressive preemptive attack against inflation is working. `` While consensus expectations are like to continue to bounce between the extremes of boom and bust, we expect that the economy will continue to chug along somewhere down the middle.''

<HEAD>Giant Hydroelectric Plant Will Be Towed Up The Mississippi</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY FOSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The vessel is anything but traditional but a ceremony Saturday will employ the standard champagne bottle christening for the world's first pre-fabricated hydroelectric plant. `` We're inflicting a little bit of shipyard tradition on it,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Wismar </PERSON>, the man who oversaw construction of the 12-story structure at <ORGANIZATION> Avondale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>. `` After all, it will be making a heck of a trip.'' Three tugs will push the 456-foot long <LOCATION> Merrimac </LOCATION>, which resembles a 12-story gray box, 208 miles up the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in late April or early May, depending on river conditions, <LOCATION> Wismar </LOCATION> said. The structure _ actually a power plant enclosed in a dam _ is so massive it will have to be partially sunk near <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> to allow it to pass under a bridge, but <PERSON> Wisner </PERSON> said no trouble was expected during the four - to five-day journey `` We will ballast it down to get under the bridge, probably by about 50-feet or five stories ... We have installed a temporary ballast system and 24 pumps to pump the water back out when we're past the bridge,'' <LOCATION> Wismar </LOCATION> said A 106-foot deep hole has been prepared at the flooded site of the new plant between the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and Red Rivers about 40 miles below Vidalia. Once the plant is floated onto the site, a levee will be rebuilt, the water drained off and the plant permanently grounded. The eight-turbine power plant is expected to begin generating electricity by 1990. The brainchild of former Vidalia mayor, <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the plant is intended to produce cheap electricity for the 6,800 Vidalia residents and help generate jobs and prosperity for the town, which has been hit hard by depressed oil and farming industries. `` When we started all of this we had 22 percent unemployment in our area,'' <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said Thursday. `` What I really wanted to do back them was just try to stabilize energy prices,'' he said. `` ... I think we can do that when the plant gets going and I think it will attract some industry to our area.'' Skyrocketing oil prices in past years sent rates for electricity from local oil-fired power plants soaring. Rates never receded when oil prices did and expectations were that if oil prices rose strongly again in coming years the electric rates again would follow suit. The plant will produce enough electricity for over 200,000 homes. Vidalia is entitled to between 6 percent and 15 percent of the electricy, enough to supply its residents. When the debt for building the $ 500 million facility is paid off in 41 years through plant revenue, <ORGANIZATION> Vidalia </ORGANIZATION> will begin receiving a third of the money from the sale of power and can set local electric rates. The other two partners are <ORGANIZATION> Catalyst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dominion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Catalyst is a wholly owned subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Merrimac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a privately-held corporation principally owned by <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, son of the noted corporate raider <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>. Merrimac and its related companies have 18 operating facilities in 13 states and 10 more projects under construction. Local officials expect the population of Vidalia to double in coming years as more businesses move to a 280-acre industrial park aimed at capitalizing on the new source of power. City officials and a lot of what <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> called `` regular residents'' planned to journey to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> for Saturday's ceremonies, he said `` It's been 13 years, and I think they want to actually see it so they'll really believe it's going to happen now,'' <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Despite Ueberroth Deal, Eastern's Future Up in the Air</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>'s $ 464 million deal to buy <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and share ownership with its unions is a major step toward untangling the strikebound carrier's problems. But can <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> and his team _ or another potential suitor who might emerge _ resurrect <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> as a competitive airline? Once any buyer gets the company back into operation, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s new managers will have to repair its battered service reputation, regain customers who deserted the virtually grounded airline and compete head-on with such aggressive rivals as <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> that already have muscled further into Eastern turf Cheaper fares _ at least for the first few weeks Eastern is back into the air _ are a strong possibility to lure back passengers, observers believe. Eastern `` is moving off dead-center,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Joedicke </PERSON>, an airline analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Whether it will fly or not, I do n't think anybody can tell this early.'' The arrival of the buyout group led by former baseball commissioner <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> has galvanized <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s embittered employees and lifted their rock-bottom morale. Picketing pilots and flight attendants at airports up and down the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> cheered news of the sale Thursday while Machinists sang `` Take Me Out to the Ballgame'' at a packed union hall in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s home base. But beyond the euphoria, <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> admitted there are two major hurdles his group must vault before <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> can again fly a full schedule: approval of new work agreements with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unions and approval of the buyout by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> creditors and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bankruptcy court. Eastern filed for bankruptcy protection and reorganization on March 9, five days after the start of a <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union strike that won the support of pilots and flight attendants, virtually grounded the carrier and drained its cash reserves. `` There are no miracle workers standing in front of you,'' <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> said in announcing the deal with <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Under the proposed buyout, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> employees would get a 30 percent stake in the carrier in exchange for some $ 210 million in pay cuts and work-rule concessions. The <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> group almost immediately began talks with the unions to beat a midnight Tuesday deadline set in the deal for reaching agreements. The airline's attempt to wring $ 125 million in concessions from its Machinists _ who in turn demanded a pay raise _ had precipitated the strike. If <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> succeeds in wresting concessions from the unions that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> was unable to get, and if the court and creditors approve, his real challenge will still lie ahead. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, for example, has been quick to capitalize on <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s troubles. The Dallas-based carrier announced Thursday that it plans to add 11 flights in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and 13 in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> _ traditionally a stronghold of Eastern. The new schedule gives <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nine new flights a day out of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and seven new flights daily out of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. Officials of American said the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> strike against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> accelerated their expansion plans. Competitors have been moving in on Eastern long before the strike began. In the past five years its leading rivals _ <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, American, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> _ together have added some 1,600 new flights in Eastern markets east of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. Some rivals have raised fares on competitive routes since the Eastern walkout began. <ORGANIZATION> Archrival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, says it has n't raised fares but has tightened fare restrictions as a result of Eastern's paralysis. `` A lot of things have to be changed'' at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Maldutis </PERSON>, who follows the industry for <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Maldutis </PERSON> is one of a number of experts who expect the airline to offer special discount fares to attract customers once it gets off the ground Other carriers, such as <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s sister <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, have sharply cut fares following strikes. The fare cuts are bound to be temporary and unlikely to be matched by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s competitors, analysts believe. `` Initially, there will be some incentive of that type -LRB- cheap fares -RRB- put in ... just to get people back to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. After that, he warns, `` It's going to be a slow, steady process of winning their customers back and keeping costs down ... They're still going to be losing money hand over fist at the beginning. With improved marketing strategy and service, a revived Eastern might start to break even by year's end, <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON> suggested. The airline has lost $ 1.5 billion over the past decade and has piled up debts totaling $ 3.2 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that the sale to <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>, if approved, would have a `` positive effect'' on the credit positions of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and Eastern. However, the credit-rating agency cautioned, `` Eastern has lost market share to competitors and will be even more dependent on price-sensitive leisure traffic without its shuttle,'' which it has agreed to sell to developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> for $ 365 million. `` Eastern has a relatively old fleet and high non-labor fixed costs. The airline will be vulnerable to competition and would be hurt badly by a recession,'' S & amp; P stated.

<HEAD>American Software Companies Sue Italian Firms For Copyright Infringement</HEAD>

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> software consortium has accused three Italian firms of pirating American programs in an unprecedented copyright infringement suit, company officials said Friday. The suit, filed Thursday in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Software </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, accuses the European companies of copying without authorization software produced by <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ashton-Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Torrance </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The Elettrocarbonium SpA, <ORGANIZATION> Montedison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION> and its affiliate, <ORGANIZATION> Monefibre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION>, were named as co-defendants in <ORGANIZATION> BSA </ORGANIZATION>'s suit, but exactly what if any compensation the group was seeking was not specified. <ORGANIZATION> BSA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said the group would likely file additional lawsuits against several other companies in the months to come. `` The level of unauthorized copying of software in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> _ not only by dealers but by organizational users _ is one of the most egregious in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said in a prepared statement. The breach had cost companies trying to develop and market legitimate software hundreds of millions of dollars, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said. Technical experts found evidence of widespread software duplication during inspections ordered by the Italian courts and conducted last week at two of the accused firms, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said. He said more than 90 percent of the software inspected at <ORGANIZATION> Montedison </ORGANIZATION> was reproduced without authorization and 80 percent of the software inspected at <LOCATION> Elettrocarbonium </LOCATION> consisted of unauthorized copies. Officials at the Milan-based <ORGANIZATION> Montedison </ORGANIZATION> and its affiliate have denied the charges. <ORGANIZATION> BSA </ORGANIZATION> officials did not know whether <PERSON> Elettrocarbonium </PERSON> had also denied the allegations. <ORGANIZATION> BSA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Pilar </PERSON> <PERSON> Cloud </PERSON> said the accused companies pirate the software by buying a single copy of a program and then duplicating it internally and reselling it. `` It's a fairly common practice internationally, but it's very illegal,'' Cloud said. `` BSA hopes to put a stop to it.'' Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> BSA </ORGANIZATION> was founded in 1988 to promote free and open trade in legitimate business software while protecting intellectual property. The consortium's membership also includes <ORGANIZATION> Aldus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Autodesk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Sausalito </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Redmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> WordPerfect </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Orem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>.

 Former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> junk bond chief <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and his brother have pleaded innocent to a massive racketeering and securities fraud indictment but their lawyers will be back in court next week to settle on bail. Looking tan and smiling, <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, 42, dressed in a navy blue, pinstriped suit entered his plea Friday before a standing-room-only crowd at federal court in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. Outside the courthouse later, dozens of applauding supporters, some wearing hats that read `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> We Believe in You,'' cheered him and shook his hand as he left without comment. `` Mr. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> looks forward to the opportunity to have his story come out in court where you have due process and the truth will emerge,'' said one of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s lawyers, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Liman </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON> denied reports that prosecutors asked it to bar employees from holding a courthouse rally for <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>. But the firm issued a statement sympathetic to <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> supporters. `` Some individuals have chosen to express their support for <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> at this very difficult and emotional time for him,'' <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> said. ` We understand their desire to express their feelings.'' Supporters also rallied for <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s annual high-yield bond conference being held this week in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> where the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> high yield bond department is headquartered. Also pleading innocent before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Kimba </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> at federal court in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> was <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON>, 40. A third defendant, former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> trader <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON> was absent due to a skiing accident and will be arraigned April 25. All three were named in a 98-count federal securities fraud and racketeering indictment handed up by a grand jury March 29. Both Milkens were released without bail after Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said prosecutors and defense lawyers `` made substantial progress'' during talks to reach an acceptable bond for the defendants and their assets. The racketeering charges seek $ 1.85 billion in forfeitures from each of the three defendants, which amounts to their total combined earnings at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> from 1984 to 1987. The government reportedly had asked the three defendants to post a $ 1 billion bond to avoid pretrial restraints on their assets. Under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act, assets found by the jury to be the result of racketeering activities are subject to forfeiture proceedings and prosecutors could ask the judge to freeze the <ORGANIZATION> Milkens </ORGANIZATION>' assets to guarantee their availability in the event of a conviction. Ms. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> scheduled another court session for Tuesday morning, at <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>'s request, to finalize bond arrangements. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, dressed in a gray suit, said, `` I plead not guilty'' in a loud firm voice when asked by the judge. In addition to the potential $ 1.85 billion in forfeiture, all three defendants face possible maximum fines of $ 3.7 billion each if convicted on either of two racketeering charges. Prosecutors, however, concede that upon conviction, a judge is unlikely to impose maximum fines or maximum prison sentences, which would be 520 years in <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s case. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, took a leave of absence from his job as head of the junk bond division, where he reportedly made more than $ 1 billion over four years, including $ 550 million in 1987. The racketeering indictment followed a more than two-year investigation of Wall Street's fifth-largest investment firm that was triggered by information supplied by convicted stock speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> in December agreed to plead guilty to six felonies and pay a record $ 650 million to settle securities fraud charges with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office. The plea deal is conditional on settlement of separate civil insider trading charges filed by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>. Sources familiar with the negotiations said the agreement could be completed next week. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, though, is challenging the criminal deal on the grounds that is violates his rights by forcing <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to fire him and withhold his 1988 pay of more than $ 100 million.
