 Ethiopian guerrillas on Thursday claimed they captured three garrison towns in northern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> Korem </LOCATION>, the site of a major government food relief station in the drought-stricken region. The towns were taken Wednesday, according to <PERSON> Yemane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kidane </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Tigrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> official. He said nothing of casualties. <PERSON> Yemane </PERSON> said a joint force of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and the newly formed <ORGANIZATION> Ethiopian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> took <LOCATION> Korem </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Wollo </LOCATION> province, while <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> forces simultaneously captured the garrison towns of <LOCATION> Amba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alage </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kasad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gudu </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Tigre </LOCATION> province, <LOCATION> Wollo </LOCATION>'s northern neighbor. The inaccessibility of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s northern region makes independent verification of government or rebel claims difficult. In <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s capital, <PERSON> Addis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ababa </PERSON>, government spokesman <PERSON> Teklu </PERSON> <PERSON> Tabor </PERSON> refused to comment. Western sources said they had heard no reports of any of the towns falling. Widespread crop failures last year have left 1 million people in need of emergency food aid in <LOCATION> Wollo </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Korem </LOCATION>, 250 miles north of <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, has been a major government food distribution station. Government relief workers there have been handing out one-month rations to about 6,000 people a day. Fighting in <LOCATION> Tigre </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s northernmost province, <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>, has crippled relief operations aimed at feeding an estimated 3.2 million drought victims in those provinces. There are 7 million drought victims nationwide. <PERSON> Yemane </PERSON> said the rebel operation was aimed at thwarting a big offensive President <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> is preparing for Tigre. The push started in <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and stalled, said <PERSON> Yemane </PERSON>, repeating claims made by the <ORGANIZATION> Eritrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. The secessionist <ORGANIZATION> Eritrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> has been fighting for 27 years in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s longest civil war. The <ORGANIZATION> Tigrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> took up arms against the <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> government in 1974 demanding greater autonomy. <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> inherited the insurgencies 14 years ago when he, with a group of army officers, overthrew Emperor <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Selassie </PERSON>. The government and the two rebel fronts all are Marxist. <PERSON> Yemane </PERSON> rejected Zambian President <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON>'s plea at the summit in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> of the Organization of African Unity that the rebels make peace with the government. `` There will be no peace in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> unless <LOCATION> Mengistu </LOCATION> is destroyed,'' <PERSON> Yemane </PERSON> said.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met privately with Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> recently to discuss political ramifications of the attorney general's ongoing legal problems, according to a published report. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, citing unidentified sources in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is vacationing, reported in Saturday editions that the secret meeting took place at <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s request shortly before May 16 The newspaper said it could not be learned what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had told <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Veterinarian Uses Auto-Body Resin, Fiberglass To Patch Up Snapping
Turtle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICHESTER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A veterinarian who used auto-body resin and fiberglass cloth to patch up a wounded snapping turtle says his 22-pound patient is `` crawling around nicely.'' A woman who found the turtle in a pool of blood off Route 28 corralled it into a box and brought it to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Messenger </PERSON>. The snapper had been hit by a car on the highway, and by the time it got to Messenger, it had lost a lot of blood and chunks of its shell were missing. Despite Messenger's experience with exotic animals _ including a cobra from which he removed a mouth tumor _ he had never worked on a snapper before, let alone a 20-year-old equipped with jaws that could nip off a finger. `` It was very challenging,'' the veterinarian said Thursday. After cleaning out the wound and covering it with gauze, Messenger injected antibiotics into the turtle's tail to fend off infection. Then he let the turtle rest for a couple days before operating on Wednesday. After trimming away dead and damaged tissue, and using a saw to cut off damaged bone and shell, Messenger used auto-body repair resin and fiberglass cloth to repair the damaged shell. `` The prognosis is very good,'' Messenger said Thursday. `` He's crawling around nicely. Messenger said he will keep the turtle for a couple of weeks to watch its recovery, then let it loose near to where it was found. Meantime, he said, he will have to find food for it. `` I think I'm going to go out fishing,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 The regime of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has used detentions, beatings, threats and sexual harassment to intimidate Panamanians and quell what appeared only a month ago to be a rising wave of protest. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> does n't have to resort to slayings or to arranging for people to `` disappear,'' as has happened in some Latin American dictatorships. Panamanians themselves are the first to admit they are unaccustomed to violent abuse and are easily cowed by it. `` I took part in demonstrations until they detained me,'' said a 27-year-old lawyer, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals. She was released after a half hour, but not before being insulted, threatened and fondled by policemen. `` We are not <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. We do n't have violence in our blood,'' said <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, secretary-general of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> was detained, interrogated and beaten May 5 when he returned from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where he had gone to take part in a conference. He was expelled to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> the next day and allowed to return on Monday. `` There is a triumph of terror,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in an interview. `` The regime is waging psychological war, and it's winning. The Defense Forces, which includes police and armed forces and is under <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s command, did not return repeated telephone calls Thursday asking for a response to these allegations. Only three people have been killed in political violence since the U.S.-backed opposition campaign to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> began 11 months ago. There are no `` disappeared,'' the enigmatic status that military regimes in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> conferred on tens of thousands of opponents in past decades. But there is a secret police, G-2, whose members have demonstrated ruthlessness. The corps is informed by street spies called `` toads'' whose pervasive infiltration of everyday life is taken for granted. `` We're not fighters, but a folkloric people; beach, sun and sea,'' said a young professional jailed and mistreated for a week last month. `` I myself am that way. It's in our genes.'' The man said he was suspected of opposition activity and taken from his home after midnight by several agents to G-2 headquarters. He was stripped and his wrists handcuffed behind his back. Asthmatic and frail, he was forced to stand under a cold shower for half an hour, punched in the face and abdomen and beaten on the legs with a rubber hose, he reported. Then he was beaten on the toes with a blackjack, a pain he describes as `` terrible.'' Still nude and handcuffed, as he was to remain for 15 hours, he was thrown into a cell where he was told he would be raped by an inmate. Panamanian rights activists say a sexual element to physical or psychological abuse of detainees is common. They report that arrested people are frequently threatened with rape or sodomy. The young man was not sexually abused, he said. But when he was taken from the cell several hours later, he was blindfolded, his mustache was burned with a lighter and the barrel of a revolver was placed at his temple. `` They told me the cemetery was just down the road,'' he said. `` My life is the university, work and my girlfried,'' said the man, who fears reprisal if his name appears in print. `` Those seven days were like a parenthesis, a long nightmare.'' `` The day after I got out, there was a -LRB- anti-government -RRB- march. I did not even think about going,'' he said. `` Our security forces are more clever than the Argentines -LRB- of the 1970s -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeden </PERSON>, a lawyer who in the past year has represented dozens of people arrested on political charges. `` Fear is stronger than cadavers. People get used to cadavers, but they do n't get used to fear.'' He said that since a failed coup attempt in March, the prevailing paranoia has spread to the Defense Forces. He said the 18 officers and soldiers under arrest in connection with the attempt have been subjected to treatment as least as humiliating as that given civilians. `` The officers know that if they cast a funny glance at <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> or one of his inner circle, they will be under surveillance themselves,'' said <PERSON> Weeden </PERSON>. `` There's even more fear inside the armed forces than outside,'' he said. Except for the coup plotters, political detainees are rarely held more than a few days or a week. Most are required to pay between $ 150 and $ 350 for their freedom, though payments of up to $ 10,000 have been reported. Opposition leaders and human rights activists call the payments `` ransoms.'' Weeden thinks the lull in protest and street demonstrations is passing, a valley to be followed by a surge. <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> said he came back to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> even though his wife pleaded with him by telephone not to. `` I'm showing my face and going ahead to help smash the terror,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mathias </PERSON> <PERSON> Rust </PERSON>, the West German aviator who a year ago slipped across one of the world's most secure borders and landed a plane at Red Square, remains jailed at Lefortovo Prison with hopes fading for an early release. The dramatic May 28, 1987, flight shook the foundation of Soviet security and oiled the way for the ouster of Defense Minister <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokolov </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Koldunov </PERSON>, but Soviet citizens still grin at the audacity of the young pilot and his success in putting one over on the mighty Kremlin. Soviet jets scrambled when Rust crossed into restricted airspace over the republic of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, but the Soviet Air Defense forces took no action to halt the flight. Then, with apparently no warning to security forces in the nation's capital, the single-engine <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> swept toward the heart of Soviet power and buzzed <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> landmarks such as <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s tomb and Spassky Tower. Rust, now 20, was sentenced Sept. 4 to four years at a general-regime labor camp on charges of malicious mischief. By mutual consent with the Soviet government, he is serving his time at the infamous Lefortovo Prison in eastern <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, which in the past contained <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniloff </PERSON> and U2 pilot <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON>. A source close to the case, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Rust asked to remain at Lefortovo rather than transfer to a less restrictive penal institution because the little-used <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> facility is more easily accessible to his parents and West German diplomats who are allowed to make regular visits. At Lefortovo, Rust has been allowed more visits than he is officially entitled to. His parents, <PERSON> Karl-Heinz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Monika </PERSON> <PERSON> Rust </PERSON>, and his 16-year-old brother <PERSON> Ingo </PERSON>, have visited Lefortovo at least five times since June. Under Soviet corrections regulations, prisoners are allowed one visit every three months. A representative of the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> is allowed to visit once each month to bring mail, books and special foods to augment the prison diet. Rust's appeal of his four-year sentence was turned down late last year. The young amateur pilot from suburban <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> has issued a personal request for clemency that does not require a formal reply. To date, there has been no reply. Soviet officials have commented privately that Rust will likely serve at least half of his term, to show that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> does not take such stunts lightly and to discourage any similar incidents in the future. Rust was accused during his two-day trial of endangering the lives of thousands of airline passengers when he piloted his borrowed <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> 172-B from <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> through the flight paths of foreign airliners headed for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Sheremetyevo Airport. Witnesses testified that he could have injured some of the hundreds of pedestrians at Red Square on the cool, sunny evening when he landed. Rust told the court he felt `` remorse and deep repentance'' and never intended to endanger or insult anyone. Before landing in the square, Rust piloted his blue and white craft at a low altitude through more than 500 miles of closely guarded Soviet territory. The dramatic stunt was followed by a short-lived moment of glory for Rust as tourists and Muscovites crowded around the plane that came to a rest between St. Basil's Cathedral and the red-brick wall surrounding the Kremlin. They asked for the pilot's autograph and took his picture as he reclined against the fuselage before his arrest. Less than 48 hours later, the ruling Politburo met in special session and sent <PERSON> Sokolov </PERSON> into retirement and fired <PERSON> Koldunov </PERSON> for negligence.

<HEAD>Walters Art Gallery Reopens After $6 Million Overhaul</HEAD>

 Three years after the original 1904 Walters Art Gallery closed for a $ 6 million overhaul, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>'s Renaissance palace museum has been restored to the glory that railroad magnate <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> envisioned for one of the greatest private art collections in the world. The renovation has created for <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>' precious jewels, bronzes, paintings and sculpture _ what gallery director <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> calls a `` seamless museum environment'' that is easy on the eye and alluring even to those not trained in art history. `` In a lot of ways, we think the public is going to see the collection for the first time,'' <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> said recently, pointing proudly to carefully concealed display spotlights designed to lure viewers. `` We direct people directly to the object through the lighting.'' The massive stone building with a marble-columned court fashioned after the 17th-century <PERSON> Palazzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Balbi </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Genoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, is one of six comprehensive museums in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> bequeathed it to the city upon his death in 1931, along with the 22,000-piece collection. The leaking roof, blackened marble, drab painted walls and poorly lighted rooms <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> inherited when he left an art history post at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and arrived here are gone. In their place stands a pristine and colorful complex of rooms featuring gleaming stone; rich, silk moire; red, blue and gold cotton damask; polished woods, glass, lucite and plaster. The works themselves were carefully conserved to bring out colors and features hidden for centuries. The renovated gallery holds some of the 30,000-object collection spanning 5,000 years of history. A 1974 addition that stayed open during the renovation holds many of the works, while thousands more lie in storage. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, who made his fortune with the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION>, left the collection _ along with a $ 3 million endowment _ to his native city `` for the benefit of the people.'' The works include such masterpieces as one of three surviving 14th-century Italian perspective paintings called `` View of an Ideal City,'' an early life-size Italian crucifix from the school of <PERSON> Cimabue </PERSON>, the first <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> to come to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and one of only 12 known paintings by <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Goes </PERSON>. Now, however, their future is assured by a climate and light-controlled environment that is so high-tech that special louvers regulate the amount of natural light let in by skylights, and storage spaces for metal works vent outside to prevent oxidation from destroying other valuable pieces. <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> jokingly calls the project a `` modest calling.'' `` We wanted to create the finest facility possible for this collection of Renaissance, Baroque and 18th-century paintings and sculpture and decorative arts,'' he said. `` To do that was a special project. The building is a work of art. We had to respect at every turn the character of this landmark structure,'' said the medievalist who moved from the rarified atmosphere of art history theory to a comfortable position as ceaseless champion of his world-class museum. <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> is satisfied with the effort, financed with $ 1 million in city funds, $ 1 million in state funds and another $ 4 million in contributions. In fact, he considers the workmanship he got for the money a bargain, pointing out how the wood in new doorways matches original woods and marble-painted sculpture bases mimic the marble columns for a consistent look. Going room to room, <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> marvels at the miraculously preserved royal jewel cabinet in wax and wood made for <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Antoinette </PERSON>; a collection of European porcelains considered second only to the British royal collection at <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION>; and some of the nearly 1,000 pieces of jewelry spanning the styles from ancient <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> to art nouveau. The installation includes a 19th-century alcove modeled on a French goldsmith's shop for <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>' delicate Faberge enamels, an iris corsage ornament created by <ORGANIZATION> Tiffany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and an ivory orchid comb by <PERSON> Lalique </PERSON>. The gallery went up between 1904 and 1909, and before <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>' death, he would open the doors a few times a month, charge admission and donate the proceeds to charity just as his father, who began the collection, had done More recently, the gallery has been drawing 150,000 to 200,000 visitors a year, including 1,500 museum members who celebrated the official opening on May 15. The first visitors to the reopened gallery included former employees as well as local visitors seasoned by a lifetime of trips. One after another, they stopped <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> to thank him for restoring the collection to splendor. `` Just hearing these people convinces me we did the right thing,'' he said.

<HEAD>Professor's Dream Girl Plans To Move To Illinois</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A 61-year-old college professor who fell in love with a Scottish bank teller's machine-recorded voice soon will get a chance to hear that voice live when the woman of his dreams moves to his hometown. `` It sort of means reducing a fairy tale come true to reality,'' <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferry </PERSON> said Thursday night. `` It could be losing some of its magic to see her grocery shopping.'' But actually, <PERSON> Ferry </PERSON> said, both he and his wife <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> are delighted that <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Masterson </PERSON>, a British radio talk-show host, has accepted a job with a radio station in this central <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> city of about 94,000 residents. It's all because of a newspaper column Ferry wrote after he heard a teller-machine recording with her voice. `` I think I'm in love with a woman I've never seen,'' Ferry wrote in his Feb. 4 column for the <ORGANIZATION> Decatur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Review newspaper. `` My infatuation is with the talking teller at the Money Network station at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> downtown,'' he said. Intrigued, the newspaper tracked down Ms. <PERSON> Masterson </PERSON>, 30, now a talk-show host in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and arranged for her to visit <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> last month. She and Ferry met _ with <PERSON> Mrs </PERSON>. Ferry, his wife of 25 years, looking on. Ms. <PERSON> Masterson </PERSON>, who is single, had made the teller-machine recording three years ago in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> NCR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, which makes automatic-teller products. `` I think he's smashing,'' she said, after meeting Ferry, an education professor at <ORGANIZATION> Millikin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. For his part, <PERSON> Ferry </PERSON> said that what began as a romantic fling in a newspaper column has become a friendship. `` I said I was in love with a voice _ and I was,'' Ferry said. `` But I'm in love with my wife. I would hope that <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> is a good friend. `` I do n't really expect her to stay in <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>. I think her voice is so impelling that she will get offers and offers.'' Ms. <PERSON> Masterson </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> earlier this week that she has accepted a broadcast job with WDZ radio and will arrive Sept. 5. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, vice president and general manager of WDZ, said he began talking with Ms. <PERSON> Masterson </PERSON> about the job soon after she made a guest appearance during her April visit. He said Ms. <PERSON> Masterson </PERSON> will have a midday show Monday through Friday, with the format still to be worked out.

 Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s speech to the National Assembly Thursday was a mixture of defiance, nationalism and a brand of patriotic populism that has characterized <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> military leadership for two decades. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictments on drug trafficking charges, had been expected to give a status report on negotiations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to end the hostile face-off between the two countries. But he dealt little with the talks, which appear to have collapsed, and concentrated instead on Panamanian sovereignty. The general suggested that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> politicians look to problems and ethical issues at home before trying to solve them in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> also accused American presidential candidates of `` using the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> flag to win votes.'' Here are some excepts from the speech and a question-and-answer period that followed: `` Pardon the ignorance but we can not understand how these rich candidates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> do n't use the flag to solve the problems of the blacks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, of the poorer classes, of the minorities, of those who have no heat, of the foreigners ... those are pretty themes for democracies.''

 Former Philippine President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> ended two-day's hospital treatment for chest pains Thursday, saying he will ask <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials to let him return to his homeland for the funeral of his mother. `` I'd like to go home and preside over the funeral rites of my mother,'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said from a wheelchair during a news conference before he was discharged from <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said his application for permission for him and his family go to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and return to the <LOCATION> Unites </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at will would be submitted Thursday or Friday at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Immigration and Naturalization office in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. When asked whether the application would be a request to return permanently to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> replied, `` Well, what else? I would like the ordinary rights of a citizen.'' Philippine President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, saying <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> poses a threat to national security, has repeatedly rejected his pleas to return for the funeral of his mother, <PERSON> Josefa </PERSON> <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON>, who died May 4 at age 95. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> should reconsider because, `` I've told them I will not bother them ... but will hold back the people from starting violence. She alone will not be able to hold them back.'' <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> Western Region Commissioner <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezell </PERSON> said he favored allowing <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return, but said the final decision rests with Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. `` We believe there is a humanitarian aspect that has to be considered,'' <PERSON> Ezell </PERSON> said. `` Whether or not you agree with everything that's happened, there is still a factor that <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is a human being who had a mother who has passed away.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is under `` a prevent departure notice,'' which means he needs permission to leave the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> district director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said he did not know how long it would take for the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government to respond to his latest request. He said no date has been set for the funeral. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was accompanied by his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, several aides, a nurse and his physician, Dr. <PERSON> Azucena </PERSON> <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON>, who said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> would be able to travel. <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' chest pains were caused by arthritis or inflammation in the area of the left sixth rib. She said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> improved dramatically by resting and was being treated with painkillers.

 Muscovites give <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> strong support for his overall program of change in their country, but only about half say they have seen tangible benefits of his program of economic change, a poll has found. Only 40 percent of participants in a poll conducted for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said they expected their families' standard of living to improve in the next five years, according to the poll published in Friday's Times. And 18 percent of 939 adults in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> households with telephones predicted their standard of living would worsen, the poll said. An estimated 84 percent of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> households have phones. The margin of error for the poll was plus or minus 4 percentage points. The poll found strong support for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s overall program, with 78 percent supporting his domestic policies completely and 19 percent less than completely. The Times said they especially liked his calls for greater democracy and openness.

<HEAD>Feds Threaten Discrimination Suit Over LA County Supervisors'
Districts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal officials plan to sue <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> for violating the voting rights of racial minorities by diluting their influence when county supervisors redrew district boundaries in 1981, a source said Thursday. Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> informed the county by letter last week that he authorized the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to sue the county for allegedly discriminating against minorities in the 1981 reapportionment, said the source, who is familiar with the case but asked not to be identified. The Board of Supervisors must remap its five districts every decade and to divide the population evenly among them. But the 1981 plan allegedly diluted the influence of Hispanics and other minorities, the source added. County Counsel <PERSON> DeWitt </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> was called for comment Thursday, but did n't immediately return the call. There has not been a Hispanic supervisor in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s 138-year history The county's only black supervisor, <PERSON> Yvonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Brathwaite </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, was appointed to the board in the 1970s and subsequently lost a bid for election. According to the 1980 federal census, there were more than 2 million Hispanics and 943,000 blacks among the county's 7.5 million residents. By 1985 there were 2.4 million Hispanics and 964,000 blacks, according to projections by the county <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Burstion-Wade </PERSON> confirmed <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s civil rights division, sent a letter to the county last week, but said she could n't comment on its contents In voting rights cases, such letters are sent to allow the target of a potential lawsuit to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and `` avoid the cost and time of litigation, which does n't help anybody,'' she said by phone from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` However, if statutory violations can not be resolved, then certainly litigation is a real possibility.'' Asked what kind of relief the government seeks in such cases, Ms. <PERSON> Burstion-Wade </PERSON> replied: `` The relief would be to protect minorities from disenfranchisement.'' <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicano </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said he understood the federal complaint against the county would involve alleged discrimination against Hispanics. `` We have always felt that the Latino community has been without power in that they have been fragmented, and they have not been able to exercise their voting ability,'' <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON> said. `` We are aware that county counsel has received a letter from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Deane </PERSON> <PERSON> Dana </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement. `` He is reviewing it and will be advising the board. Until that process is complete, we will not have any comment beyond that.'' <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON>'s letter first was revealed publicly in Thursday editions of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, which cited anonymous sources. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> filed a similar lawsuit in 1985 that forced the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to shift a district from the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> to the city's largely Hispanic east side. The suit led to the election to the City Council of former Assemblywoman <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Molina </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> based its 1985 complaint on the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which prohibits redistricting that causes minority residents to have `` less opportunity than other members -LRB- of the community -RRB- to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.'' The lawsuit claimed that the city's 1982 plan splintered the political influence of Hispanics by spreading them thinly over many districts.

<HEAD>House Passes $1.1 Trillion Budget For 1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is moving with unusual speed toward final approval of a $ 1.1 trillion federal budget for the 1989 fiscal year, thanks to a little bipartisan cooperation and a lot of creative arithmetic. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved the spending plan by a 201-181 vote on Thursday shortly after <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators reached agreement on a compromise document after six weeks of haggling. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is expected to give quick approval to the measure after the chamber returns early next month from its Memorial Day recess. The budget meets the spending ceilings for domestic, defense and international affairs programs set at last fall's budget summit by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and congressional leaders. It also obeys the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law's $ 146 billion deficit target for fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1. If the red ink grows beyond that level, the law calls for automatic spending cuts to reduce the deficit to $ 136 billion. `` This, I believe, is a balanced approach,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, D-Pa. The numbers used in the document were shoehorned into the budget summit and Gramm-Rudman limits by lawmakers intent on avoiding fights over spending and taxes in an election year. The legislators used relatively rosy economic assumptions produced by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, rather than more pessimistic projections calculated by the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. As the economy worsens, government spending grows and its revenue shrinks, producing more red ink. In addition, when their numbers threatened to spill over the budget summit's constraints, the lawmakers fiddled slightly with the definitions of the spending categories they used, allowing them to claim they had abided by their pact with the White House. Even with that craftiness, the budget might still surpass the $ 146 billion limit set by Gramm-Rudman. The law requires a fresh look at the spending plan's projected deficit in August, using updated readings of the economy's performance Rep. <PERSON> Delbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, had told him Thursday that `` it would be a miracle'' if the automatic spending cuts are avoided. Despite that warning, 26 Republicans joined 175 Democrats in voting for the measure. Final congressional approval early next month would be unusually quick. The legislators, however, already have upheld their annual tradition of missing the April 15 deadline set in law for completing the budget. The measure contains $ 299.5 billion in new defense spending, $ 18.1 billion for international affairs and $ 148 billion for domestic programs for 1989. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 8.1 billion increase over spending this year is below the amount needed to keep pace with inflation. Education, health, social services and job training programs would all be given enough money to match inflation increases. Some other programs _ including AIDS research and treatment, anti-drug initiatives, space and air traffic control _ would be boosted enough to surpass the costs of inflation. The election-year measure would allow an additional $ 1.4 billion in anti-drug spending later this year if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> decide that an emergency exists. The extra money would have to be covered by spending reductions in other areas or by new revenues. In legislation passed in December, $ 14 billion in new taxes for fiscal 1989 already have been written into law. The budget approved Thursday includes no other additional revenues. The two chambers had differences of about $ 1 billion _ small ones in budget terms _ over how much money should be spent for science, space and education. In their compromise, the lawmakers agreed to $ 13 billion for space and science and $ 37.2 billion for education. They also agreed to a 4 percent pay raise for military personnel and federal civilian employees to take effect in January. The raise would apply to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, who already earn $ 89,500 annually. If included in forthcoming appropriations bills, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would earn $ 93,080 a year, a raise of $ 3,580. The budget does not require the president's signature, and is used as a guideline by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as it passes the 13 appropriations bills that actually provide money for federal spending. But this year, its value seems even more questionable than usual because the two chambers have already begun work on their spending measures.

<HEAD>Soviets Express Optimism That Global Ban May Soon Be Near</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PORTON, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet experts accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of undermining progress on a global chemical weapons ban, but still expressed optimism that 20 years of talks would soon culminate in an agreement. Leaders of the 13-member Soviet delegation told a news conference that the talks sorely need a political initiative from <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and British leaders. However, just days before <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> get together in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for their fourth summit, the Soviet chemical weapons experts took a tough line against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> resumption of chemical weapons production. `` Such steps undoubtedly run counter to the aims of a chemical warfare convention,'' said <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazarkin </PERSON>, chief Soviet negotiator at the 40-nation <ORGANIZATION> Geneva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Disarmament, where the chemical weapons ban talks have been taking place. The news conference Thursday ended the Soviets' three-day visit here, the first time they have been at a chemical warfare facility in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuntsevich </PERSON>, deputy commander of the Soviets' chemical troops, said current <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production of binary weapons _ in which elements that are harmless on their own become lethal when combined _ is dangerous, `` uncontrollable and unverifiable. He said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to end an 18-year moratorium on chemical weapons production last December raised Soviet suspicions that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> plans to supply binary weapons to its <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies. Still, <PERSON> Nazarkin </PERSON> appeared more optimistic than his British counterpart at the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks, Ambassador <PERSON> Tessa </PERSON> <PERSON> Solesby </PERSON>, that a verifiable agreement on the development, production and stockpiling of chemical weapons can be reached soon. `` The international negotiations in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> have actually entered the decisive stage of development ... We firmly believe that this convention will be achievable soon,'' <PERSON> Nazarkin </PERSON> said. `` In order to overcome the differences that still remain,'' he said, `` what we need is impetuses to solve the problems at a political level, not a technical level.'' But <PERSON> Solesby </PERSON> said getting <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> to give the negotiations a political push will not solve the main problem of verification. `` It is not a matter of lack of political will. ... It's the technical difficulties that remain,'' she said. The Soviets and their British hosts stressed the historic significance of the three-day visit to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Porton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Down </LOCATION> in southwest <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. But they disagreed on the size of the Soviet stockpile and the wisdom of setting a timetable for reaching a final agreement. <PERSON> Nazarkin </PERSON> said `` the successful outcome of negotiations depends on a time limit to settle and tackle all the unresolved problems.'' <PERSON> Solesby </PERSON> said: `` We do not feel artificial time limits are helpful.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said last year that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has a 50,000-ton stockpile. Western estimates have put it at 300,000 tons. <PERSON> Nazarkin </PERSON> insisted the Soviets had not lied about the size of their stockpile and said inspectors may see it as soon as an agreement is signed. He accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of inflating their estimates to justify the start of binary weapons production. He said the Soviet stockpile was now at parity with the American stockpile, which he also estimated at 50,000 tons. But <PERSON> Nazarkin </PERSON> expressed concern that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> binary weapons production could change the balance. The Americans have not disclosed the size of their stockpile but Western estimates put it at 30,000 tons. <PERSON> Solesby </PERSON> said <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> started producing binary weapons to counter Soviet production and replace its own aging stockpiles. During their visit to the 7,000-acre Porton Down facility, the Soviets held wide-ranging talks with British experts and watched <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> soldiers respond to a simulated enemy nerve gas attack. In July, a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> delegation will visit the chemical warfare facility at <LOCATION> Shikhany </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. Last October, specialists from the <ORGANIZATION> Geneva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> visited <LOCATION> Shikhany </LOCATION>, where they were shown chemical weapons which seemed to date from the 1950s. The following month, Soviet inspectors visited a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> chemical weapons disposal plant at <LOCATION> Toole </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, where they were shown techniques for destroying old gas munitions.

<HEAD>Data Shows Most Laid-Off Workers Did Not Have New Jobs Lined Up</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than three-fourths of the workers who lost their jobs to plant closings or mass layoffs last year did not have new jobs lined up when they went off their companies' payrolls, according to new government data Of the 406,887 victims of plant closings or large layoffs in 29 states in 1987, 78 percent, or 319,343, filed claims for unemployment insurance benefits, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The government tracked those people through state employment offices and found that 85,548, or more than one-fourth of them, exhausted their unemployment benefits _ an average $ 139 a week with a 26-week maximum in most states _ before finding new work. The report was hailed by advocates of the 60-day advance notice requirement that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> cited as a major reason why he vetoed the 1,000-page trade bill on Tuesday. `` With that kind of advance notice, many of these people would have had an opportunity to seek new jobs while currently employed and would likely not have had to draw unemployment insurance,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaluskey </PERSON>, an economist for the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>. The advance notice provision was approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> after surveys by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> showed that two of every three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> workers caught up in such layoffs get no warning. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> said in a report last year that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's reliance on `` voluntary'' notices is `` not providing workers with the ... ` best practice' minimum of two or three months to adjust successfully to job loss.'' The academy estimated that advance layoff notices would reduce by 25 percent the time a laid-off employee is out of work, saving hundreds of millions of dollars in unemployment benefits. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, however, said when he vetoed the trade bill that the layoff notice requirements would `` cost jobs and damage our economic growth.'' Business groups supportive of the bill in general had urged <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to veto the measure because of the layoff provision, which <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lesher </PERSON> called `` the camel's nose under the tent'' in a broad union agenda for more government control in the work place. The House on Tuesday immediately overrode <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto, with Democrats rejoicing that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had given them an issue for rallying voters in the November election. Democratic presidential front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` do n't understand that for working families ... there is nothing more painful than losing a job.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which passed the trade bill on a 63-36 vote that was short of what would be needed to override <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto, was expected to take up the measure again early next month. The report Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> was the first comprehensive examination of the mass layoff phenomenon ever released by the government. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 ordered government statisticians to start conducting the survey after the nation's unemployment rate soared to 11.4 percent and the rolls of the unemployed grew to 12.5 million during the first two years of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s administration. Since then, the jobless rate has dropped to 5.4 percent _ the lowest since 1974 _ with fewer than 7 million people now out of work in the longest peacetime economic expansion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. Of the 29 states surveyed in 1987, two _ <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> _ accounted for one-fourth of the total layoffs. Five other states _ <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> _ accounted for another fourth. The 29 states were <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. `` Slack'' or `` seasonal'' work was listed by employers in the survey as accounting for about half of the layoffs. The other biggest reasons cited for them by employers were completion of contracts, 7 percent; business ownership changes, 4 percent; and import competition, 2 percent.

 For the first time in its uniquely American history, <ORGANIZATION> Ringling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Barnum </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> <PERSON> Circus </PERSON> is staging a colossal three-ring assault on the land of sushi and sumo wrestling. `` We are coming to entertain you!'' boomed <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Holst </PERSON>, the show's associate producer and former ringmaster, at a <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> news conference Thursday Flanked by five clowns, two jungling acrobats and a hula-hoop artist, he smiled and intoned, `` It is our hope and our interest that you will smile and laugh, and hide your eyes in fear.'' For 15 weeks starting in July, Japanese kids of all ages will be dazzled by daring trapeze acts, animal tamers, 25 clowns, 16 elephants, 14 lions, and assorted camels, llamas, dogs and chimpanzees under a big top. Coordinating trans-Pacific transportation for beasts, about 300 humans and 100 tractor-trailer loads of lighting and sound equipment and supplies in the circus' first overseas trip are enough to astound. <PERSON> Holst </PERSON> estimates Ringling Bros. spent at least $ 10 million for the production. The big top goes up this summer in <LOCATION> Sapporo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION>. Organizers hope to attract as many as 1.2 million Japanese and already are planning a 25-week run in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> next year. `` We are not interested in the short-term profit,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gold </PERSON>, Ringling marketing supervisor. `` We want to build a tradition. The Japanese public may have seen a circus before, but they've never the ` Greatest Show on Earth.''' Japanese got a sneak preview this week when <PERSON> Ringling </PERSON>'s promotional team unleased the clowns, jugglers, and hula-hoopist in full costume on the streets and television airwaves of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> `` Humor is universal,'' said blue-haired <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudert </PERSON>, whose nose was painted red. `` At first people are kind of surprised. But they really like slapstick.'' The ringmaster will continue to herald the acts in English, hoping Japanese audiences will pay close attention to his arm as he points to the various rings. Acts among the 130-member troop will include the Human Cannonball and the Globe of Death, in which two men on motorcycles race simultaneously inside a large chain-link ball, sometimes with their wives standing in the middle. `` We do n't know if what we're bringing will offend people,'' Gold acknowledged. `` Like today, -LRB- the Japanese sponsor -RRB- wanted to take the clowns around to some newspapers. I said, why do n't you take four, and I'll take one with me. `` He said no _ in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, four is an unlucky number. It means death,'' <PERSON> Gold </PERSON> said. He shrugged and raised his eyebrows. `` I did n't know that. Ticket prices will run $ 40 a head _ about the cost of a ticket to a rock concert here _ compared with a maximum of $ 12 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We cost maybe twice the price of a movie,'' Gold said. `` But where else can you see 250 people and animals risking their lives?''

 Conventional wisdom says President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will benefit politically by the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit. But conventional wisdom is n't infallible. Consider the following: <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is enormously popular at home, but, as he prepares to leave office, little of that support appears to be transferring to Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> faces problems at home, but most stem from his stumbling efforts to reform Soviet society. His rivals on the ruling Politburo appear to agree on the need to improve relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, reduce international tension and fix the Soviet economy. It is the nature, speed and consequences of the fix that divide them, say the experts. Open elections and reliable public opinion polls are still a thing of the future in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and instead Western analysts will be watching a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference at the end of June to determine how much confidence <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> inspires in his countrymen. Numbers, if not answers, are easier to come by in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Opinion polls show Americans overwhelmingly back arms control agreements, if they are negotiated carefully. A survey this month in the bipartisan Americans Talk Security series said 77 percent of those polled backed the treaty to eliminate medium-range missiles. The treaty, signed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at their <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> meeting last December, now appears headed for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ratification in time for the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit. The survey said 82 percent backed a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty to cut superpower strategic arsenals by half. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> both say a START deal is possible by the end of the year, but they remain divided over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plans for a missile defense system, verification issues, and limits on heavy land-based missiles and air - and submarine-launched cruise missiles <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s success in bargaining with the Soviets to date may improve his treatment in history books, but it does not seem to help <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who according to a <ORGANIZATION> CBS-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll last week was trailing the probable <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The poll gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 49 percent to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 39 percent. An <ORGANIZATION> ABC-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll this week gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 53 percent and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> 40 percent. One prominent <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporter, Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, said that `` the vice president is going to be running on a very powerful peace and prosperity platform. But the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people have found that so successful that they are looking at other issues. The very success of the Republicans has bred a public nonchalance to the big issues of our time.'' Critics of the Republican administration attribute progress in arms control to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> rather than to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who entered office declaring that the Soviets had broken every treaty they had signed with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` One of the calling cards of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is that these people have brought the Soviets into line by setting out tough policies and sticking to them,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendelsohn </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a liberal <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> group. `` But that's not what happened,'' said <PERSON> Mendelsohn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, he said, changed because he decided it was in the best Soviet interests. Opinion polls indicate broad support for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s approach. The Americans Talk Security survey showed that 68 percent of those polled favored caution in dealing with the Soviets, compared with 28 percent who advocated seizing the opportunity presented by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> may be losing his fight to stack the June party conference in his favor, said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Laqueur </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Of the 5,000 delegates to the conference, said <PERSON> Laqueur </PERSON>, 3,500 will be made up of government and party officials thought to oppose <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform efforts, and most of the rest are being selected to regional party organizations, many of them also hostile to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` The outlook is for a conservative membership,'' said <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>. And that could stymie <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s perceived drive to win a comfortable majority on the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the policy-making body which until now has put the brakes on his more radical ideas.

<HEAD>SEC Seeks Jurisdiction Over Chicago Futures Markets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is declaring its independence from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration by pushing its own proposals in the regulatory turf war that has followed the October stock market crash. A sharply divided commission voted 3-2 to ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for jurisdiction over the stock index futures markets in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, an area now regulated by a sister agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Members voting for the proposal noted that the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> already regulates the trading of stocks and stock options and said that it was only logical that the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> also oversee trading of futures contracts based on stocks. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> has already lost on the issue in an interagency working group formed to develop administration policy on market reform. The panel, whose members represented the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>, issued a report last week calling for no major legislative initiatives. Democrats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> reacted with dismay to the working group's recommendations, which all but preclude the chances of a market bill this year Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, called them `` pitiful. However, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s move to stake out an independent position pleased Democrats looking for a means to rekindle sentiment for change. `` The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> today distinguished itself from the do-nothing strategists of the rest of this administration,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee with jurisdiction over the stock markets `` The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> has demonstrated intelligence, courage and common sense,'' he said in a statement. Aides to <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> are drafting a bill that would transfer jurisdiction of equity-related futures from the commodity commission to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. However, two members of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> do not want that authority. Commission member <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischman </PERSON> argued that each commission was best qualified to oversee the separate markets. `` We come from different backgrounds. ... We wear different spectacles,'' he said. Commission member <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grundfest </PERSON> said he agreed with the goal of more consistent regulation, but said that seeking to take over part of the commodity commission's jurisdiction would only cause rancor and provoke a `` firestorm'' in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, where separate committees oversee the two agencies. `` I think we could have and should have proceeded on the path of cooperation. That could have gotten us a lot of what we wanted to achieve. ... We have instead embarked on a path I would describe as regulatory imperialism,'' he said. However, commission Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> control of stock and stock futures regulation flows logically from the recommendations of an earlier presidential task force, composed of members of the financial community. The so-called <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> task force, headed by investment banker <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, said the futures and stock markets are economically one. `` I think it's time we move to what I think is a rational way of regulating that interlinked market,'' <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said. He was supported by Commissioners <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aulana </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> voted unanimously to offer four other recommendations to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and decided to withhold one for futher discussion. In one, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> said it should have emergency power to call trading halts, delay the opening of markets or close them early. The commission would have to seek permission from the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to continue a trading halt beyond 24 hours, and the president would have the power to overturn any emergency action by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. If enacted, the emergency authority would reverse the current arrangement, which requires the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> to seek presidential permission before calling a trading halt. The commission also asked for authority to require the reporting of securities trades of larger than $ 5 million. That is intended to make it easier for the agency to track index arbitrage, a form of computer trading involving the simultaneous sale of large groups of stocks and futures contracts.

<HEAD>Behind Arms Treaties Lie Difficulties In Monitoring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence satellites took months in 1983 to find a site in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> where the Soviets were building an early warning radar system in violation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The incident illustrates the difficulties of monitoring arms control deals, an issue at the heart of debate over the treaty signed at the summit last December to eliminate medium-range nuclear missiles. The discussion will become even more heated as the two sides discuss a proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty to slash longer range arsenals by 30 percent to 50 percent. Despite the unprecedented on-site inspection provisions of the <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate-Range </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> pact, to monitor it `` we are going to rely about 95 percent on National Technical Means,'' or satellites and listening stations, said former arms control negotiator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhinelander </PERSON>. The task is complex, said the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., because `` if you are going to hide a missile, you are very unlikely to hide it in a site where other side has the right of on-site inspection You are going to put it somewhere else where it is concealed.'' On the question of test monitoring, a congressional scientific study said Thursday that seismic technology is sensitive enough to confidently monitor all but the smallest Soviet underground nuclear tests. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> are expected to sign a pair of protocols designed to improve test monitoring procedures. The study by the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION>, an arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said `` seismology now provides a means to monitor underground nuclear explosions down to low yields, even when strenuous attempts are made to evade the monitoring systems.'' But finding hidden missiles appears to be beyond the capabilities of the two KH-11 photographic satellites the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is thought to have in orbit now. To fill the gap, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on May 17 approved a compromise with <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, who had been seeking billions of dollars in additional money over several years to boost the number and quality of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spy satellites. Soviet defectors, among them <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Myagov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Suvorov </PERSON>, have said the Soviets track <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence satellites and try to fool them by covering up sensitive activities or by deploying dummy armaments. And the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has made similar allegations about the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In the 1970s, the Soviets were irked to find that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> maintenance workers had covered Minutemen missile silos with tents, blocking them from satellite inspection in violation of arms control accords. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side said it was raining. Probably it was flooding, because the tents stayed up for three months,'' said <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Falin </PERSON>, a non-voting member of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and frequent spokesman on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations. <PERSON> Falin </PERSON>, interviewed recently in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, cited the tent incident as an example of the need for trust in verifying arms control accords. <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said the Soviets have `` little incentive to cheat'' on the pact eliminating their 707 medium-range missiles, which are kept at known sites. But, he said, `` when you get to START, where you are reducing down by maybe 5,000 missiles, you have a much higher incentive to cheat'' because of the difficulty in many kinds of weapons spread across the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` Our means are not adequate to cope with that kind of demand without some substantial modernization and upgrading,'' <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said in an interview. The amount of the spending increase and the exact hardware sought by <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> is classified, but he says, `` I am not just talking numerically. I am talking qualitatively as well.'' One likely improvement would be radar-imaging satellites, able to peer through clouds and darkness. `` Remember our technical means are not just charged with verifying arms control agreements,'' <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said. `` We also have to keep up with what is going on in around the world. We have other needs,'' such as monitoring events in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, keeping track of conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and around the globe, and watching weapons tests. Former <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> staff member <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Codevilla </PERSON> argues that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> needs more and better satellites to provide targeting information on two new classes of Soviet mobile missiles, the SS-24 and SS-25. `` What we have now is good for looking at places of known interest with means that are themselves known and that have very limited areas coverage,'' said <PERSON> Codevilla </PERSON>, now at the <ORGANIZATION> Hoover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. In the 20 minutes it would take an ICBM to fly from <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, a mobile missile could be moved out of the intended blast area. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Codevilla </PERSON>, needs to monitor Soviet missile sites around the clock to be able to change the course of missiles in flight. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Arkin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said that the overall product delivered by the satellites `` is, in a nutshell, not very good.'' The exchange of information between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators has produced far more information on <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> weapons systems than intelligence collection, said <PERSON> Arkin </PERSON>. For example, before the exchange of data in the INF negotiations, said <PERSON> Arkin </PERSON>, the Pentagon estimated the number of SS-20s at 441 and the number of SS-23s at 20. Soviet data provided last December put the figures at 405 SS-20s and 102 SS-23s, including one battery never spotted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence.

Toll</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The long Memorial Day weekend that begins today may claim the lives of 380 to 480 people in traffic accidents, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> has estimated. The three-day holiday period begins at 6 p.m. today, local time, and ends at midnight Monday for counting purposes. During last year's Memorial Day weekend, 416 people died in traffic accidents, the Chicago-based council said Thursday. The worst Memorial Day traffic toll in the last quarter century was recorded in 1968, when 629 people died. The lowest recorded toll, in 1982, was 341. About 390 traffic deaths on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> roadways would be projected for a non-holiday, three-day weekend this time of year, statistics clerk <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said Thursday.

<HEAD>Value Of Farm Exports To Reach Four-Year High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New estimates by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> put the value of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural exports at a four-year high of $ 33.5 billion this fiscal year, up from $ 27.9 billion in 1986-87. Actual quantities of shipments may reach 145.5 million metric tons, up from 129.2 million tons last year, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. Export values dropped to a decade low of $ 26.3 billion two years ago but improved slightly to $ 27.9 billion in 1986-87. The tonnage of shipments dropped to 109.5 million tons in 1985-86 before recovering in 1986-87. Despite this year's gains, the current estimates are still far below the record of $ 43.8 billion and 162.3 million tons in 1980-81 before world economic conditions, high interest rates, foreign competition, a rising value of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar and other factors triggered the slide. The new foreast also was up by $ 1 billion and 3 million tons from <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s previous estimate on Feb. 25. Officials attributed the boost to a growth in animal products, horticultural products and soybeans. The boost in tonnage `` reflects improved prospects for wheat, feed ingredients and soybeans,'' the report said. The value of animal products was boosted $ 600 million from the February forecast to a record of $ 5.6 billion this year, due to `` stronger-than-expected demand for hides, red meats and animal fats,'' the report said. `` Most of the increase in volume stems from larger grain exports as the Export Enhancement Program and tighter competitor supplies boost the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share of world markets,'' the report said. `` Also, higher prices are expected for grains, oilseeds and cotton.'' Under the <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> arrangement, selected countries _ including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ have been getting wheat and other designated commodities at prices subsidized by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. Imports of agricultural products this fiscal year were forecast at a record $ 21 billion, up $ 500 million from the February estimate. Last year's imports dropped slightly to $ 20.6 billion from $ 20.9 billion in 1985-86, the previous high mark. But as a result of export values climbing more rapidly, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural trade balance _ the difference between exports and imports _ is expected to rise sharply to $ 12.5 billion from $ 7.3 billion last year. However, the 1987-88 balance would still be far less than the $ 19.1 billion edge <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm exports had over imports in 1983-84.

 <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Plowman </PERSON> says he has no plans to carry out a massive reorganization of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s primary science agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Plowman </PERSON>, who will collect an estimated $ 126,500 a year to head up the agency, has been rumored as having been tabbed to revamp the agency, including the pruning of a number of high-level jobs. But <PERSON> Plowman </PERSON>, who is head of the department of animal, dairy and veterinary sciences at <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday that he has no such intentions. `` They've been reorganized to death,'' he said. `` We're going to work with what we've got.'' <PERSON> Plowman </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> job appointment was announced on April 15 by Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> at a salary of $ 77,500 a year. It was subsequently disclosed, however, that <PERSON> Plowman </PERSON> _ who retired from the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agency in 1984 after 27 years to go to work for <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> _ will be on loan from the university under a lawful arrangement that will permit him to continue drawing his federal retirement income, estimated at $ 35,000 a year. Additionally, he will get $ 14,000 a year in per diem to help with relocation and the higher costs of living in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Technically, the university will pay <PERSON> Plowman </PERSON>'s $ 77,500 salary as head of the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agency, but the department then will reimburse <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> State for that amount. However, if <PERSON> Plowman </PERSON>, 59, at some point in the future decides to rejoin <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> permanently, he will have to give up his retirement income, at least until retiring again from the federal government.

 A decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to loosen up acreage controls on 1989 wheat production `` indicates the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> intends to be a grain seller, not a grain storer,'' says the president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Johannsen </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Bayard </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, wheat farmer, referred in a statement released Thursday to an earlier <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> announcement that producers would be required to idle no more than 10 percent of their wheat base acreage to qualify for 1989 program benefits. The acreage set-aside was 27.5 percent for 1988. But <PERSON> Johannsen </PERSON> said the smaller land-idling requirement `` requires a continuing federal commitment'' to operate the Export Enchancement Program, or <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, which has helped reduce surplus <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat stockpiles. Under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, selected foreign countries _ including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ have been able to buy huge quantities of wheat at subsidized prices. `` We intend to work closely with <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to see that existing export assistance programs are used effectively and that the past oversupply of wheat not be allowed to reoccur,'' he said. `` For 50 years _ and often to its detriment _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has held virtually all the world's surplus grain,'' <PERSON> Johannsen </PERSON> added. `` With the 1989 wheat program, we shift that burden to our competitors.''

 Fourteen years ago <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosnovsky </PERSON> and her sister <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> <PERSON> Keiss-Kuna </PERSON> applied together to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Only one got out. The other's struggle for an emigration visa is a poignant symbol of the human rights issue to be raised in the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit next week. In separate interviews, the two sisters sounded the same note of skepticism about the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> commitment to improve conditions for Soviet Jews, despite sharply rising emigration figures. `` We are hostages. We are like goods for sale in the political negotiations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Keiss-Kuna </PERSON>, 46, said in an interview in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> last month. `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> sells human rights. But it is not cheap for him,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Rosnovsky </PERSON>, 48, who brought her campaign on behalf of her sister to <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> on Thursday. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> until Sunday to rest and prepare for the summit. Mrs. <PERSON> Rosnovsky </PERSON>, an Israeli, came to the Finnish capital as part of a delegation sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Soviet Jewry to draw public attention to the issue. Mrs. <PERSON> Keiss-Kuna </PERSON>'s name is on a list, which includes as many as 300 Soviet Jews, that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> want to bring to the attention of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, said Mrs. <PERSON> Rosnovsky </PERSON>, a violinist with the Israeli Philharmonic Orchestra. She showed a reporter a March 1 letter from Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> in which <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> pledged `` to persist in our efforts to make the Soviets live up to their human rights obligations.'' But he cautioned: `` I can not offer you any specific encouragement in the case of your family.'' She said that on Monday her sister and another <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> activist were stopped from boarding a train for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, where they were invited to meet <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> along with several dozen other `` refuseniks,'' or Jews denied exit visas. Two Soviet officers `` followed her to the train and then took her to the police -LRB- station -RRB-'' where she was detained for three hours. `` Now they follow her all the time,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Rosnovsky </PERSON>. She said she spoke to her sister Wednesday by telephone. `` She's not a soldier. She's just a woman ... But she's stubborn She will fight,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Rosnovsky </PERSON>. Last month 1,086 Jews left the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the highest monthly figure in seven years. But it fell far short of the 1979 peak level when about 4,000 departed every month. The Israeli government has said about 400,000 of the three million Soviet Jews took initial steps toward emigration, but only a few thousand followed through with formal visa requests. Mrs. <PERSON> Keiss-Kuna </PERSON> last month said she was denied permission to leave because she worked as a radio engineer and could possess sensitive knowledge. She calls the authorities' continued refusal to let her leave `` absurd'' since she was fired from her job 13 years ago. Mrs. <PERSON> Keiss-Kuna </PERSON> asserted that the improvement in emigration was part of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s efforts to improve his image without changing his repressive policies. `` He is very, very clever to get so much good publicity for such little steps,'' she said. `` It is very easy to take a few steps with Jewish people. everybody knows the support we have, so they -LRB- the Soviets -RRB- made some steps and everybody applauded.' Mrs. <PERSON> Rosnovsky </PERSON> has been battling for her family every since she left them behind in 1974. She said her father was allowed to leave in 1976 following the intervention of <PERSON> Golda </PERSON> <PERSON> Meir </PERSON>, then retired as <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> prime minister, with contacts in the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Internationale </ORGANIZATION>. Her mother spent more than three years in a psychiatric prison, but was released a few years ago and came to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

 A West German surgeon believed to be the first in the world to repair livers outside the body says the procedure offers a temporary reprieve for victims of one of the bleakest forms of cancer. `` It's the best possible retaliation -LRB- against cancer -RRB- for these patients, and they are improved dramatically,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Pichlmayr </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hannover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pichlmayr </PERSON> said Thursday he has performed out-of-body liver operations three times, including twice this month. There was no other option for the patients, two women and a man suffering from malignant liver tumors, he said. In each case, <PERSON> Pichlmayr </PERSON> removed the liver, worked on it for four to five hours, then put it back in tumor-free. All three patients are doing well, although it's likely the tumors will reappear, <PERSON> Pichlmayr </PERSON> said. `` It's the fate of all tumor patients. But we surgeons have to do our utmost to take care'' of them, he said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pichlmayr </PERSON> said he is giving the patients time and perhaps a chance for a longer life. He said he's also giving them hope. `` That's a very important reason,'' he said. `` We've improved the quality of life very much.'' Until <PERSON> Pichlmayr </PERSON>'s efforts, so-called bench surgery had involved only kidneys, a well-established procedure to correct vessel problems or remove cysts and benign tumors. Kidneys are less delicate than livers and a patient can do without them longer. `` It represents a very interesting and positive step,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>'s Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON>, who performed the world's first liver transplant in 1967. `` My hat's off to him. It's a monumental effort,'' said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Najarian </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Najarian </PERSON> said he has transplanted donor livers into four patients with cancerous liver tumors. Only one is still alive. Unlike <PERSON> Pichlmayr </PERSON>'s patients, there was no evidence the cancer had spread at the time of surgery. `` You're just buying time,'' <PERSON> Najarian </PERSON> said. Liver cancer is among the more deadlier forms of the disease, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahaney </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. If detected early, patients have a 10 percent to 30 percent chance of surviving five years. If not, they have a mere 3 percent chance. Pichlmayr first performed out-of-body liver surgery Feb. 5 on a 40-year-old woman whose liver had more than doubled in weight because of tumors. He considered transplanting a new liver into the woman, but ruled it out because he believed her cancer had spread, and that it would have been a waste of one of the scarce donor organs. <PERSON> Pichlmayr </PERSON> also decided against the conventional method of removing the cancerous sections of the liver while it remained in the body because of the tumor's size and central location. <PERSON> Pichlmayr </PERSON>, who described the procedure in a West German medical journal in April, removed the woman's liver by cutting and clamping its numerous vessels. He connected two main veins to a pump that served as a bypass and kept the blood coursing though her body. After five hours and 19 minutes outside the body, the liver was reinserted as a transplanted organ is. The woman has since returned home, <PERSON> Pichlmayr </PERSON> said. `` She's gained weight again and at this moment she's very healthy,'' he said. `` She was suffering extremely, and I think she would not be alive now.'' <PERSON> Pichlmayr </PERSON> performed the operation again May 6 on a 48-year-old woman and May 11 on a 58-year-old man. `` The lady is at home, quite well,'' he said. `` The man is still in the hospital, but is good.'' Three days before his first out-of-body liver surgery, <PERSON> Pichlmayr </PERSON> performed the world's first split-liver transplant, in which one donor organ was divided and each half transplanted into separate patients.

 Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> told a packed <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> session that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' take-it-or-leave-it attitude forced the collapse of talks about his leaving power `` The world must know that the conversation sustained with the envoy of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> broke down when he presented us with an ultimatum in which <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> had to immediately accept his last offer,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said. `` I know it and I say so because I was there. -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State -RRB- <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was n't there,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said in his speech Thursday to a cheering crowd in the 500-seat assembly chamber. Outside the chamber of the 67-member assembly, hundreds of people listened to his words through a loudspeaker. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who commands <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s 15,000-strong Defense Forces and is his country's de facto leader, did not elaborate. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> on Wednesday announced the breakdown of talks and blamed <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The general said Thursday that <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> had accepted several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposals, but added: `` Even this was n't sufficient. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> desired an ultimatum.'' In exchange for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s stepping down, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had offered to lift economic sanctions it imposed on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> after the general was indicted on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug trafficking charges in February. It also offered to have the indictments dismissed. The White House still recognizes the presidency of <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, whom the Noriega-dominated <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> deposed Feb. 26 after <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire the general. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> appeared before the assembly to answer questions about what the government insists on calling `` conversations,'' not negotiations, on a possible arrangement under which he would relinquish power. Asked whether his resignation had been discussed, the general replied: `` The commander does n't abandon his ship in stormy weather.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has become a pawn for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> political candidates and charged them with `` using the flag of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in whatever way is convenient for them.'' He said some candidates want `` to bury files that weigh on their shoulders,'' but did not explain. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the likely Republican presidential nominee, has been accused of having detailed knowledge of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s alleged links to Colombian cocaine traffickers before the general was indicted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> denies the allegations. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on Thursday repeated his conditions for stepping down: Extra troops sent to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> must be withdrawn and the position of <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, who took over as president after <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s ouster, must be guaranteed. Earlier, <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> told a women's organization that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators told <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in March to be out of the country in 48 hours or face the consequences. When <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> refused, <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> said, the Americans softened their manner. He did not elaborate on what was meant by `` consequences.'' <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> said the final <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> offer was to drop the drug charges against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in return for his giving up command of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> on Aug. 12 and leaving <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in September. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also had promised to release $ 50 million in Panamanian assets frozen in American banks if a national unity Cabinet was chosen that picked a president `` who could not be <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>.'' Meanwhile, President <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> offered to mediate a solution to the impasse. <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Thursday that <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is experiencing `` a radicalization against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that is dangerous for the region and that moreover is causing grave damages to the Panamanian nation.'' He said he had spoken with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Panamanian officials on `` the possibility of a plan aimed at finding a space for dialogue in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to consolidate a democratic process.'' <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> met on Thursday with <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION> also told reporters he recently held conversations with <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s opposition <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> said Thursday that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators failed to strike a deal with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> because of a growing division in the Panamanian military of which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was not aware. `` Errors by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were not the only factor although they were a factor,'' he said.

 To convince a jury that the government authorized his role in the Iran-Contra affair, businessman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> may want to question <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> about his congressional testimony on the subject. To show jurors that his direction of an aid program for the <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> Contras was sanctioned despite a congressional ban, <PERSON> North </PERSON> may want to ask <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> about his congressional statements on the operation. Like his one-time business partner <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, businessman <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> may need to use <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s testimony during a trial. Normally, a defendant can try to prove his innocence in a criminal conspiracy trial by questioning a co-defendant about his prior statements. But the Iran-Contra case has developed an apparently unprecedented legal tangle that could make it impossible for the defendants to exercise that right. The dilemma is so serious that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said Thursday it may be impossible to prosecute the defendants on the conspiracy charges that form the heart of the case. The testimony of defendants <PERSON> North </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staffer; <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, the ex-national security adviser; and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> was given to joint congressional committees under a grant of limited immunity from prosecution. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> office, did not testify under immunity, but he has filed legal briefs contending the immunized testimony of North could prove his innocence. The immunity grant to three defendants means independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> can not use the immunized testimony against them, and he would be precluded from using it against <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> if all four are tried together. But left unclear Thursday was whether the defendants could question each other about the congressional testimony. `` As I see it, it is a practical impossibility to try the conspiracy counts in the context'' of rules on immunity, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said. `` If you try them together you violate the immunities.'' But <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> added that trying the defendants separately `` makes a conspiracy trial a farce. None gets the benefit of the other's testimony. The judge said he did not want to conduct four separate trials under a separation motion sought by the defense. `` Four individual trials is ridiculous,'' he said. He added that he `` searched hard to find a case _ and I have n't found one _ where it's fair to say that three of four defendants have been broadly immunized by governmental action. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> made no ruling on the immunity issue, but said he hoped to resolve the matter and other defense motions by the end of June. The judge scheduled a closed hearing for June 13 to determine if any lawyers for the State, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Departments </ORGANIZATION>, the White House and <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> used the defendants' immunized testimony to prepare officials for questioning by <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s grand jury. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he wanted to determine if any of the many government officials <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> intends to call as trial witnesses were influenced by immunized statements made by the defendants. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, a former federal judge representing <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, said the immunity grants wo n't prevent a fair trial. If <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> wants to question <PERSON> North </PERSON> about his congressional testimony, `` all General <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> has to do is ask Colonel <PERSON> North </PERSON> for the same facts, and out it comes,'' <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> argued that most of the witnesses <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> intends to call at trial were so influenced by the immunized statements `` you ca n't unscramble from what the witnesses know now, having seen, read and analyzed that testimony, from what they knew before.'' The four defendants are charged with conspiring to corrupt the sale of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> by diverting profits to the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> during a time when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> banned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to them. The four are also are charged with theft of government property and wire fraud in connection with the alleged diversion. In addition, <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> are charged with making false statements and obstructing investigations by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> into covert assistance given the Contras.

<TEXT>
 Government scientists are planning to spend a month studying the skies over <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> to learn how much effect summer storms have on acid rain. The project, which will start on June 1 and continue for four weeks, will use both radar and airborne measurements to see how long and how far storms carry pollutants, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` If you're going to get a handle on pollutants that are put into the atmosphere and what their impact will be downwind, you have to know what happens to them aloft,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said Thursday. `` How much of the pollutants fall out within a 10 - or 20 - or 50-mile range of the source he asked. `` How much of it gets carried aloft and moved further along? What are the conditions that cause it to either fall out early on or get carried along for some distance? A scientist always has to know why.'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said that the study being undertaken by his agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, federal research laboratories, several universities and the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION> will provide `` a body of knowledge from which the policymakers can reach decisions on acid rain.'' During the four-week study based at <LOCATION> Willard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Champaign </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, one team of scientists will use flying laboratories to see how storms redistribute pollutants, while another team will use a new radar technique to observe the movement of pollution in the troposphere, seven to 10 miles above the ground, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. He said a team from the oceanic and atmospheric administration's <ORGANIZATION> Aeronomy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, will be conducting a related study to test two kinds of Doppler radars, one for monitoring upper-level winds and the other for winds near the surface At the same time, the Illinois Water Survey will use its rainfall-collection network to determine how much pollution is contained in rainfall from local storms.

<HEAD>EPA Adds 100 Counties To List That Might Need Pollution Controls</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal government is telling more suburbanites that urban air pollution could be spreading their way and they might have to accept new controls. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday designated more than 100 additional counties that must be considered in drawing up new plans to control air pollution, mostly in urban areas. Most of the counties are on the edges of 107 metropolitan and rural areas already designated as failing to meet federal standards for ozone, carbon monoxide or both. Not all the new counties are suburban. <LOCATION> Nantucket </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, an island 30 miles off <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION>, was added to the list of those that must be considered when new carbon monoxide control plans are drafted by the state. The counties were picked not because their air is polluted _ in most of them there are no measurements _ but because census data suggest they could be contributing to area-wide pollution, such as through heavy auto commuting. Some counties will be dropped as planning goes forward, but those that remain could find their industries facing additional controls and their residents required to submit their cars for pollution inspections. `` Clearly what I'm doing is not sufficient to deal with the problem,'' <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> told a news conference. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said he was doing nothing that would pre-empt congressional revisions to the Clean Air Act aimed at eventual compliance with federal standards, something originally expected in 1977. He said, as he had before, he hoped <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would tell him what to do next. But if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> does not act by Aug. 31, when an eight-month prohibition on sanctions against recalcitrant areas expires, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said he will require states to come up with new controls, as he outlined last November. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> had planned to forbid construction of major new pollution sources in 14 cities when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> temporarily barred the action last December. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> lists 68 areas as failing to meet federal ozone standards and 59 as not meeting carbon monoxide standards, with 20 not meeting both. Thursday's decision adds 125 counties to the 225 counties in the ozone areas and 115 counties to the 96 counties in the carbon monoxide areas. There is some overlap in the two lists of counties. Thursday's designations came in expected formal notices to 44 state governors and the mayor of the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> that <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> was disapproving air pollution control plans, or revoking previous approvals, for the non-complying ozone and carbon monoxide areas. <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> have no non-complying areas and are not affected. States have 60 days to submit schedules to complete new plans, which can take two years; to fulfill promises in old plans; to begin new assessments of actual pollution as opposed to computer estimates; and to add monitors where <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> says they're needed.

<HEAD>Rent Voucher Program to Be Extended to Rural Families</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some rural families will soon be able to take advantage of a federal program that is helping 110,000 urban residents pay their rent, sometimes with cash left over for the renter. Housing and Urban Development Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> announced Thursday that <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s housing voucher program was being extended into 50 public housing districts in 13 states. Initially, the program will aid only 2,178 rural families, but officials say they hope it can be expanded to other housing districts and states. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> has asked for funding to issue an additional 100,000 vouchers in fiscal 1989. The largest numbers of rural vouchers will be available in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s announcement <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoenberger </PERSON>, deputy federal housing commissioner, said areas in those states and in nine others were chosen because they had public housing authorities that appear most ready to set up the rural programs in cooperation with the <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The voucher program, which began as an experimental alternative to public housing in 1984, became permanent under a law signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> earlier this year. Qualified low-income families may be given housing vouchers worth the difference between 30 percent of their family income and the local `` payment standard'' for adequate housing in the area where they live. Officials said that <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> expects to be funding more single-family dwellings in rural communities than it does in cities, where most recipients live in apartments. The program contains what <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials call a `` shopping incentive,'' allowing renters to rent whatever kind of housing they want, rather than limiting them to public housing projects. `` We think it's a program with a great amount of sensitivity to it,'' <PERSON> Schoenberger </PERSON> said. He said that the vouchers allow people to receive aid without subjecting themselves to the social problems that often plague public housing projects. In a typical situation under either the rural or urban programs: A family might be earning $ 10,000 a year, meaning that it would be expected to pay 30 percent of its income or $ 3,000 in rent. If <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> determines the `` payment standard'' for an adequate unit for the family to be $ 5,000, the family would receive vouchers worth $ 2,000 a year. Recipients then can decide whether they want to pay $ 5,000 and use all of the voucher, stay in a $ 3,000 unit and use the additional funds for other needs, or pay more than $ 5,000 to further improve their lifestyle. In public housing, renters do n't see any of the assistance given by the government. Under the voucher program, an arrangement can be made to return money to the renters if they can find a unit that rents for less than the subsidy. <PERSON> Schoenberger </PERSON> said that there already may be a line of applicants for the rural vouchers in some housing authorites, but in others, there could be an `` opportunity to pretty much walk into the door and take advantage of it.'' Under the program, select <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> housing authorities will assist 441 famlies; <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, 422 families; <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, 380; <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, 225; and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, 130. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will each be allowed 100 vouchers, while <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> will each serve 50 rural families, and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> will help 30.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> said he remains confident that a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee will refuse to recommend that he be impeached on charges of conspiring to solicit a bribe. On Thursday, at the end of five days of hearings before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Judiciary subcommittee on criminal justice, <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> said: `` I have n't heard anything new so far. These are old charges. They all came up in my trial.'' Asked how he would assess the hearings to date, <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> replied: `` <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> five, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> nothing.'' The subcommittee hearings will continue next Wednesday. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, who still sits on the federal bench in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, has been accused by an investigative panel of the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> of taking part in a bribery scheme with his close friend, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. Borders. Borders was convicted in 1982 of arranging a $ 150,000 bribe for <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> from two <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> racketeers, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON>, in exchange for a promise of lenient sentences. One year later, a separate trial jury acquitted <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> of conspiring with Borders to solicit a bribe from the Romano brothers. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> is also charged with compromising an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation into zoning code corruption in the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area in 1985. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who directed the Hastings-Borders investigation, testified at Thursday's subcommittee hearing that <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was a target from the beginning of the probe <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> also said that <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> and Borders were n't illegally lured into taking the bribe even though an undercover <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent gave $ 120,000 to Borders before he was arrested on Oct. 9, 1981. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> began the investigation after an informant, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dredge </PERSON>, had bragged that he controlled several judges, including <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> and another federal jurist who was not identified. He said the undercover operation took place because `` we were only trying to prove or disprove what -LRB- Dredge -RRB- said.'' In answer to a question, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> `` was a target from the outset. His name was mentioned by Borders.

<HEAD>Democrats Agree to Drop Contested Plan to Ban AIDS Discrimination</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Democrats pushing for expanded AIDS testing and counseling say they had to drop a bitterly contested provision protecting AIDS victims from discrimination to get their bill moving. The bill, which provides $ 400 million next year and each of the following two years for AIDS testing, won voice vote approval on Thursday from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> health subcommittee. The measure now goes to the full <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for a vote, probably early next month. A similar bill is pending in a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee. The bill was welcomed by some in the gay community, even without the ban on discrimination, because of its provisions for counseling and confidentiality of test results. `` Even without the non-discrimination provision, it's worth having,'' said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gay </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lesbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. Subcommittee chairman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif., said that the anti-discrimination provision was dropped because `` unfortunately, that policy is caught up in such controversy that we will not be able to pursue it at this time,'' Asked what went into the decision to drop it, an aide replied, `` Counting votes. <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, D-Ore., said that they hoped they could eventually win a ban on discrimination against AIDS victims and carriers The discrimination ban not only would protect AIDS victims, but also encourage voluntary testing, <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON> said, because `` many Americans will be reluctant to come forward for voluntary testing if they are then open to blatant discrimination on the basis of the results.'' `` We've got to keep pushing. That's the one key missing part,'' he added. <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON> and <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> said that federal laws and policies clearly state that discrimination by the federal government and its contractors is not allowed. But `` there are some real questions about the private sector,'' <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON> said. The bill authorizes new and expanded testing programs run by states, localities and private groups. Testing would have to be voluntary and accompanied by counseling. Anonymous testing and use of pseudonyms would be permitted to the extent possible under state laws. Under the measure, health professionals or others who violated confidentiality standards outlined in the bill, intentionally or negligently, could be fined up to $ 10,000 for each offense. On its third and final day of deliberations Thursday, the subcommittee agreed to an amendment saying that money in the bill can not be used for counseling `` that promotes or encourages, directly, homosexual or unsafe heterosexual activity or intravenous substance abuse.'' The amendment also says that counselors must supply `` the most current scientific knowledge available ... provided that any informational materials used are not obscene.'' The amendment arose after conservatives in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> complained that the Gay Men's Health Crisis in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which receives federal money, produced an educational comic book and videotape that explicitly depicted homosexual acts. The panel also approved amendments requiring testing of people convicted of intravenous drug use, prostitution or a crime related to sexual assault, and making it a crime for a person to contribute to a blood bank or have sexual relations if he knows he has AIDS or carries the AIDS virus. Amendments requiring testing of marriage license applicants and hospital patients were rejected. The subcommittee also refused to require that public health authorities be given the names, addresses and phone numbers of people who do n't have AIDS but test positive for the virus that causes it. AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is transmitted through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring. There is no known cure for the disease, which damages the body's immune system.

<HEAD>House Members Lash Out at `Zero Tolerance' Drug Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> blames the public outcry over the new federal `` zero tolerance'' anti-drug policy on wealthy Americans whose boats are being seized by the government. Customs Commissioner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON>, in his first appearance before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> since the policy began, said Thursday that seizures of vessels at sea after discoveries of miniscule amounts of illegal drugs were affecting `` arrogant stock brokers and smooth lawyers who think they're above the law.'' <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> told members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and navigation subcommittee that complaints were coming from `` rich people who have a lot of pull with the media, who have a lot of pull with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' The policy, he said, `` is supported by the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' Joining <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> was Admiral <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, commandant of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, who disputed lawmakers' complaints that his service was squandering money from its already tight budget. <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> told the legislators that the arrests and seizures were occurring only during routine patrols and inspections, saying, `` I am not wasting resources in this policy.'' Most members of the subcommittee, however, rejected the officials' claims and insisted that zero tolerance was a case of an overzealous government going too far. `` In the minds of the public, this is a government policy gone awry,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, the panel's ranking Republican. `` It symbolizes unfairness.'' The subcommittee's chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutto </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., was one of several lawmakers who complained that the seizure of fishing boats after crewmen were found to have tiny amounts of drugs was depriving innocent owners of a means to earn a living `` Innocent persons are being hurt more than users,'' he said. Some members of the panel engaged <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> in heated exchanges. Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, complained to the Customs official about a small boat seized in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> after paraphernalia such as rolling paper and rolling machines were discovered. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said that such implements could be perfectly innocent and told <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON>, `` You're not helping the cause here at all. In fact, you're hurting it.'' Under the policy, Customs and <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officers finding small amounts of illegal drugs during searches conducted at sea have begun arresting people and seizing boats. The new procedures have resulted in the temporary seizure of such boats as the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> II </ORGANIZATION>, owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, after a crewman was found to have a tiny amount of marijuana. In addition, the $ 2.5 million yacht <ORGANIZATION> Ark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> and the Monkey Business _ the pleasure boat that former presidential candidate <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> sailed on with model <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> _ were seized after small quantities of drugs were discovered. Under new guidelines issued late last week, authorities finding small amounts of drugs on board vessels beyond the 12-mile limit now are seizing boats only if they appear to be involved in transporting drugs into the country. Some lawmakers defended the policy. Rep. <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Herger </PERSON>, R-Calif., conceded that zero tolerance needs adjustments but said he believed the policy is sound Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Clement </PERSON>, D-Tenn., said, `` My constituents want a tough policy, and that policy is that no amount of drugs is OK.'' <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said that the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has made 1,500 seizures _ mostly of automobiles crossing into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ since zero tolerance took <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> said 44 boats have so far been seized, 13 of which have already been released. The Customs Service implemented the policy on March 21, and the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> followed suit on April 11.

<HEAD>House GOP Rebuffed in Effort to Renew Military Aid to Contras</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 House Republicans staged a legislative ambush in an attempt to renew military aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contra rebels, but were rebuffed amid fears that such a move would upset delicate negotiations in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. In a surprise move, Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., sought Thursday to amend an intelligence bill to permit President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to dip into the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s contingency fund to finance future covert military aid to the rebels The measure was defeated, 214-190. Since 1983, the law authorizing intelligence operations has contained a prohibition on use of the spy agency's contingency fund to buy weapons and other supplies for the Contras. The ban was imposed after lawmakers became angered at the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s role in aiding the Nicaraguan war. <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>'s amendment would have dropped the prohibition from the law. At present, the rebels can receive only humanitarian aid _ food, clothing and medicine _ from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> under a $ 17.7 million program approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year. Proponents of the move argued that things have gone badly for the rebels since <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> voted earlier this year to end military aid. The two sides are nearing the end of a two-month truce agreed to during talks at <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The Contra supporters said that the Nicaraguan government has taken advantage of the cease-fire to weaken the rebels and has failed to live up to promises made in a regional peace accord reached last year. Instead, they argued, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have harassed peaceful anti-government demonstrators, arrested labor leaders and denied press freedom. Giving <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> the power to resume covert military aid any time after Oct. 1 would add pressure for the <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> regime to release political prisoners, restore civil liberties and hold free elections, supporters of the amendment argued. Opponents of the move noted that a new round of negotiations between the two warring sides was taking place in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> and said that there was still hope that a lasting peace could be achieved. `` I can not think of a more pernicious, ill-timed amendment,'' said Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, D-Mich. `` At the very minute that the Contras, who have struggled for three weeks to put their own act together, ... meet with the government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, an amendment is offered to put the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> back into this war. In another attempt to pressure the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, a group of conservative lawmakers announced plans to seek new military aid for the rebels if the <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> government fails to meet its obligations under the peace accord by the time the formal truce ends on May 31. Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, while declining to give precise figures, said the package would include substantial military and humanitarian aid, sufficient to last the Contras a year to 18 months.

<HEAD>Gore Would Bring Southern Strength To Democratic Ticket</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: One in a series of occasional profiles of vice presidential
prospects.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> remains on the list of possible <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidates for the vice presidency despite calling the job a `` political dead end'' when he was seeking the No. 1 spot on the ticket. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s prospects of joining the ticket declined in the estimation of some Democrats as a result of his attacks on both <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the final weeks of his presidential campaign. He would bring to the ticket, however, credentials as a Southerner with proven popularity in the region. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> ended his 1988 presidential hopes after the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary in April, his campaign a failure outside of the region-wide victories in the Super Tuesday primaries. At 40 the youngest of the potential vice presidential nominees, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> remains in the speculation in part because of those Southern successes. Some observers contend that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, needs a Southerner on the ticket if he is to carry any states in the region that is often crucial to Democratic electoral strategy. Other Southerners getting frequent mention are Sens. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> insisted throughout his campaign that he had no interest in the No. 2 job. He did not flatly rule it out, however. `` I have no interest in it _ might very well turn it down, indeed, and probably would,'' he said once. `` I think Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will demonstrate again this year that it is a political dead end,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> met privately with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> recently. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> insists he is not considering the selection of a running mate until he has collected a majority of convention delegates. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has nearly 400 Democratic National Convention delegates. He has asked them to remain committed to him, but he has been losing delegates nearly daily to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. When his presidential hopes reached a stage of desperation, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> turned up his attacks on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and accused him of foreign-policy blunders born of inexperience and lack of knowledge. He turned attacks on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, too, on foreign policy _ and blasted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as `` afraid to say a single word about <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> backed <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and picked up the criticism of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> with a vengeance. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> aides were dismayed by <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s attacks. Even <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> seemed to cringe, although he did not take public issue with his newfound supporter. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> is the son of a veteran <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> politician, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, who spent 32 years in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> before losing his seat in 1970, with his opposition to the Vietnam War an issue. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> enlisted in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and served in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. He was born and educated in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, attending the elite <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albans </ORGANIZATION> prep school and then <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>. His wife, <PERSON> Tipper </PERSON>, was a high school sweetheart, and she has become well-known in her own right for leading public crusades against violent and sexually explicit lyrics in music aimed at young people. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> worked as a newspaper reporter in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, and entered both divinity school and law school, not completing either. He quit law school after two years when the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat his father once held came open, and won election in 1976. He won election to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1984, when Republican <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> declined to run again. Although he has a congressional voting record decidedly more liberal than some of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>'s other members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> positioned himself in the presidential race to the right of most other Democratic contenders.

<HEAD>Latest ABC-Post Poll Gives Dukakis 13-Point Lead Over Bush</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic presidential front-runner, holds a 13-point lead over <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee-to-be <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, according to a poll published today. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leads <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> 53 percent to 40 percent, the survey by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> indicates. The poll also found that the vice president's unfavorability rating is nearly four times as great as that of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is viewed unfavorably by 37 percent and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by 10 percent, the newspaper said. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor is favorably rated by 67 percent of those surveyed, to 50 percent for the vice president. The survey also indicated that the `` gender gap'' plays a part in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' lead at this stage. Among women voters, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> holds a 2-1 lead, 61 percent to 33 percent. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has the advantage among male voters, but only of 4 percentage points, the newspaper said. The survey of 1,172 randomly selected registered voters nationwide also suggested, however, that the support of both candidates is `` soft'' and could easily shift between now and the November election. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' edge over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> widened when compared to a similar Post-ABC poll conducted in March. In that survey, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had a 5-point lead. Several other polls conducted in recent weeks have given <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a double-digit lead. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, 57 percent of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporters said they backed the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor largely because they do n't want <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to become president The Post noted that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has the backing of most <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> supporters, but said that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s disapproval rating stands at 46 percent On specific issues, the Post-ABC survey indicated that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has a 2-1 edge when the two are compared on the topic of national defense, and scored a bit better than <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on fighting inflation and keeping taxes down. But on virtually all other issues, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was ahead. The Democratic contender was seen as likely to do better at keeping the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> out of war, helping the poor -LRB- by a large margin -RRB-, reducing the drug problem, protecting the Social Security system and keeping unemployment down. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was also given an edge in issues like providing leadership, reducing the threat of nuclear war, bringing down the deficit and maintaining high ethical and moral standards in his administration. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp has played down the recent favorable poll results. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, however, has reacted to the surveys by pointing out that the election is months away and the situation could change dramatically once the two have secured their respective parties' nominations and are campaigning directly against one another. The telephone interviews for the survey were conducted from May 19 to May 26. The margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points, the newspaper said.

<HEAD>Heart Disease Death Rates Highest In Northeast, Lowest Out West</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Heart Disease-List</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If you live in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, your chances of dying from a heart attack may be twice as great as in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, according to a study that finds `` significant'' geographic differences in heart-disease death rates. The national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that heart-disease rates were generally highest in concentrated, urbanized areas of the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, while the West had the lowest rates. `` We're talking about thousands of deaths difference between the low states and the high states,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Remington </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> researcher. Heart disease is the leading killer in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, taking more lives each year than all other causes combined, according to the American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. In 1985, 540,800 Americans died of ischemic, or blocked-artery, heart disease _ most commonly heart attacks, according to <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> statistics. <PERSON> Remington </PERSON> said the stress of urbanization itself is probably not to blame for the high rates in the densely populated <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, but many people in those regions probably have lifestyles that could lead to more heart attacks. `` Just living in a big city does n't appear to be a risk factor,'' he said. `` But more desk jobs, and greater reliance on automobiles, all are part of a sedentary lifestyle that contributes to greater risk of a heart attack.'' He said lack of exercise contributes to weight gain, higher cholesterol levels, stress and high blood pressure _ all factors in heart disease. `` Lack of exercise can be directly connected to all these factors,'' <PERSON> Remington </PERSON> said. Another likely cause of significant state-to-state discrepancies, <PERSON> Remington </PERSON> said, is the prevalence of cigarette smoking. `` These -LRB- Northeast and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> -RRB- states are the states that have high rates of cigarette smoking,'' he said. `` And we do know that cigarette smoking is the most important preventable cause of heart disease. Most deaths from smoking are heart attacks _ not lung cancer.'' In contrast, `` the lowest rates of smoking are in the West,'' he said. The five worst states for men and heart disease _ <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> _ are all in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> or </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, where other states with the highest rates were clustered, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> reported. The best rates are clustered near <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. The five lowest heart disease death rates for men were in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. Similar geographic patterns were shown for women, although males historically suffer most from heart disease. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> had the nation's worst rate, with 320 out of every 100,000 men dying of ischemic heart disease in 1985. The national average was 249 per 100,000; in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the rate was 151. <PERSON> Remington </PERSON> said other possible causes for the geographic disparities include cholesterol levels and differences in medical care, for which no firm state-by-state data are available. Sociodemographic differences and population shifts also might play a part, the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said in its weekly report. However, heart disease death rates for all ages and geographic areas have decreased in the last two decades, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said, citing previously reported research. <PERSON> Remington </PERSON> noted that much of the nation had similarly high heart disease death rates in the 1950s, `` then <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and the Western states began declining. There's something about it. ... In certain states, it started earlier.''

<HEAD>Another Justice Official Reportedly Leaving</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Another adviser to Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> is about to leave his <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> post, according to a published report. Meanwhile, a majority of people surveyed in a new poll say they have a negative impression of the attorney general. Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> is talking with private law firms and is expected to announce his resignation before independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> issues a report on his yearlong criminal investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s financial dealings, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in Friday's editions. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> is expected to release his report within the next few weeks. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> played a leading role in the unsuccessful efforts to win confirmation of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and was among a small group of trusted aides who helped <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> investigate the Iran-Contra affair in November 1986. Two other top department officials, Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and criminal division chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, quit recently out of concern that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s continued tenure was hurting the department's operations, morale and public image. The Post, which quoted unidentified sources, said that <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> did not return repeated telephone calls on Thursday seeking comment.

<HEAD>Two Dead In Blast, Indian Government Bans Use Of Shrines By
Extremists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two Indian laborers died today of injuries suffered when a bomb went off in a crowded market in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, a northern Indian state racked by Sikh separatist violence. In another development, the federal government issued an ordinance banning the use of temples and shrines for political activity or the harboring of wanted criminals. President <PERSON> Ramaswami </PERSON> <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON> issued the ordinance on Thursday, aimed at ending Sikh extremists' use of the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> as a base for their separatist activities. The bomb, apparently hidden in a rickshaw, went off Thursday night in the town of <LOCATION> Phagwara </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Karpurthala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. The Press Trust of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> news agency said 30 people were injured, most of them laborers from nearby work camps. The news agency said three of the victims were in serious condition at local hospitals. It quoted police as saying the bombing was the work of the <PERSON> Barbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalsa </PERSON> gang, one of a dozen Sikh extremist groups operating in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state. The news agency quoted <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Swaran </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> as saying police raided a number of the radicals' hideouts in a search for the bombers Sikh radicals, who have been waging a guerrilla war for an independent homeland in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> since 1982, recently stepped up attacks on Hindu migrant workers in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. Government officials say that one-third of the estimated 700,000 Hindu migrants have fled to their homes in eastern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, threatening to undermine <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>'s agricultural economy. The new ordinance was described by the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> newspaper as `` the first step toward separation of religion from politics.'' Legislation to make the rule permanent will be introduced in the next session of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, government officials said. Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has a majority in both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, and the legislation is expected to be enacted quickly. Violations will be punishable by imprisonment of up to five years or a $ 770 fine. The ordinance was announced after the <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> committee of elders that governs the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> and other Sikh shrines said it could not cooperate with police in keeping the sites free of extremists. Police and paramilitary troops have maintained a cordon around the Golden Temple since May 9, when Sikh radicals inside the shrine fired on police inspectors outside its walls. A siege ended May 18 with the surrender of the last of about 200 Sikh extremists and sympathizers from the shrine. Forty-six deaths were reported during the confrontation, most of them Sikh militants. The <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported today that the government has decided to go ahead with a plan to tear down scores of shops and homes close to the shrine. The creation of a `` security corridor'' would improve the ability of police to patrol around the complex and prevent extremists from entering through numerous alleys around it. Sikh militants have killed more than 1,170 people in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> this year in hit-and-run attacks. Last year, 1,030 people died. Sikhs, whose religion was formed 500 years ago as an alternative to <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> and Islam, claim they are discriminated against by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s majority Hindus. Sikhs make up less than 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million population but are a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Government Plans Talks On Northern Ireland; Protestant Given Life
Terms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> indicated it wants to talk with <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s main political parties about returning some local control to the province. Strife-torn <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> has been administered directly from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> suspended the provincial parliament there in March 1972 because of sharp differences between the majority <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> and minority Roman Catholic communities. In <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, meanwhile, a deputy commander of an outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> paramilitary group was sentenced Thursday to three life terms in prison after confessing to three murders and 41 other terrorist crimes. Lord Justice <PERSON> MacDermott </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> McClean </PERSON>, 40, and said the defendant had pleaded guilty to terrorist crimes that could never have been proved if he had not confessed to police. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the Secretary of State for <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, said in a statement Thursday night that he would consider further how progress might be made towards giving some power back to <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s provincial authorities. The announcement by <PERSON> King </PERSON>, the Cabinet member responsible for the province, followed a series of separate talks in recent months involving him and political leaders from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Earlier Thursday, <PERSON> King </PERSON> met with the province's two main Protestant politicians, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Molyneaux </PERSON> and the Rev. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Molyneaux </PERSON> is leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Official </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> is leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The liberal British newspaper The Guardian said <PERSON> Molyneaux </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> had agreed to talks with <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s moderate <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The Guardian said however that it has yet to be seen whether the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> wants to talk with the Protestants. In <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> Crown Court, Judge <PERSON> MacDermott </PERSON> said he believed <PERSON> McClean </PERSON>, a leader of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, had confessed because he wanted to clear his conscience. In addition to the murders, the charges for which <PERSON> McClean </PERSON> was convicted included manslaughter of a policewoman, six attempted murders, bomb making, causing explosions and illegal possession of guns. The prosecution said <PERSON> McClean </PERSON>'s first victim was a 62-year-old Protestant, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, who died during a gun and bomb attack on a <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> bar in 1973. <PERSON> McClean </PERSON> had admitted in a written confession to police that he and two other men attacked the bar because it was owned by a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> McClean </PERSON>'s two other murder victims, killed in random attacks against <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> targets, were a 45-year-old taxi driver in 1984, and a 30-year-old hospital chef last year. Both were Catholics. The policewoman died while on patrol in 1975 in a bomb attack at a bar at the east coast resort of <LOCATION> Bangor </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>After 15 Years Of War, U.S. Bombs Still Deadly, Aid Workers Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VIENTIANE, Laos (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A mother of 10 tending her garden, two workers digging a canal and several children are among the most recent victims of American cluster bombs dropped on <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> during the Vietnam War. It's been 15 years since the last American sorties were flown over this Southeast Asian nation, but the death toll continues to mount, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> relief workers say. Buried in the jungle of this land-locked nation, the fruit-shaped bombs, each about the size of a tennis ball, still maim and kill. Although total casualty figures have not been compiled, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Mennonite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> say hundreds have lost their lives or limbs to the devices since the end of the war. Since January, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> aid workers say, the bombs have killed 10 people and injured 12 others on <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>' Plain of Jars. In May, five bombs were found by a joint U.S.-Laotian team searching for the remains of Americans missing in action at a crash site in <LOCATION> Savannakhet </LOCATION> province. Nicknamed `` guavas'' or `` oranges'' by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops or `` bombies'' by the Laotians, the anti-personnel devices were dropped during the 1964-73 air war over <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumpf </PERSON> of American Friends says the Laotian government has not worked to clear the bombs. <PERSON> Rumpf </PERSON> said the once strategic Plain of Jars remains perhaps the most dangerous zone and large tracts of land can be farmed only at great risk. During the war, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> dropped thousands of bombs on the area, turning it into a moonscape. Laotians say two tons of bombs fell for every human being on the plain. The area was a key communications and transport route between <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and was used by Communist forces as a supply route. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Mennonite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> _ the only <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> aid organizations allowed into communist <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> to date _ operate here on a small scale. Local officials reportedly are eager for outside help, but the central Laotian government has rejected tentative offers for official <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> assistance. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for its part has given the cold shoulder to such proposals for aid. <PERSON> Rumpf </PERSON> has spent five years in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> since the 1975 communist victory over the U.S.-backed <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION> government. His group has provided farmers with 20,000 shovels, said to be far safer than hoes, which tend to set off the bombs on impact. The Mennonites have offered to supply Laotians with a custom-built tractor with a special detonator for bomb-littered fields but volunteers to drive the machine have been lacking. Now, the Mennonites are awaiting word from <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION> authorities on a program to set up bomb-clearing teams in each district of <LOCATION> Xiengkhouang </LOCATION> province, where the Plain of Jars is located. The proposal was submitted a year ago. <PERSON> Rumpf </PERSON> said that with the passing of time the small bombs have become especially dangerous. Monsoon rains and erosion have driven some beneath the surface of fields while others `` float'' back up to the topsoil. Villagers find the weapons a good source of income. The innards of the bombs are sold to the Vietnamese as ball bearings for bicyles, and casings are turned into wick lamps. The metal from larger bombs is fashioned into household utensils. Statistics vary, but standard histories say more bomb tonnage was dropped on <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> than on any country in history. Sometimes cited is the figure 2 million tons _ more than the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unleashed in all of World War II. The Plain of Jars was ravaged, as were areas along the vital communist supply route, the Ho Chi Minh trail, in southern <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. Few buildings were left standing, farm animals were killed by the thousands and refugees swarmed from these regions.

<HEAD>Bull Killed After Terrorizing Residents</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A 1,500-pound bull terrorized residents for over two hours, flipping a dog, charging cars and an air conditioner and scattering backyard items before being shot and killed, witnesses and police said. `` The animal was highly agitated. It was intense negotiations from behind the car, I'll tell you that,'' said sheriff's Sgt. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyble </PERSON>. The black-and-white <PERSON> Holstein </PERSON>, who jumped a fence for the second time after it gored a cow to death about a week ago, went on a rampage Wednesday. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON> said the bull chased her inside and then came right up to her front door. `` He was pawing the ground and snorting. I was waiting for it to plow through at any time,'' she said. `` I had six kids in the house who were crying.'' Ms. <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON> said the bull flipped a neighbor's dog through the air but did n't hurt it. `` It scared the life out of everybody. There were people in their houses with loaded guns. They did n't know what it would do next,'' she said. The bull ripped through hedges, dented a car and a truck, tore down clotheslines and scattered boats, barbecue grills and lawn furniture, witnesses said. `` One of the neighbors told me the bull was looking at its reflection in a sliding glass door. And when a nearby air-conditioner compressor came on, he got startled and rammed the air conditioner with his head,'' <PERSON> Wyble </PERSON> said. The bull also attacked a sheriff's patrol car, although no damage was reported, <PERSON> Wyble </PERSON> said. Deputies used food to try to entice the animal into a nearby pasture, and county animal control officers tried to corral the bull for more than two hours to no avail, <PERSON> Wyble </PERSON> said. With the approval of Animal Control Division Director <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, a deputy fired four 12-gauge shotgun slugs into the animal's head, killing it, <PERSON> Wyble </PERSON> said <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said the bull had earlier caused problems but had been lured back into a fenced-in pasture. It jumped the fence again before entering the residential area here west of <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and was shot in the backyard of a home. `` We tried everything we could, but in the end it came down to a matter of public safety,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. The animal was owned by <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, who neighbors said is out of the country.

 Democratic presidential front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is increasingly shifting the focus of his campaign to the general election this fall, even though he's keeping up the pretense that the party's nominating strugggle is n't over yet. `` We have not carried <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in years,'' he told an enthusiastic rally Thursday night as he wrapped up a quick, trip in advance of the state's June 7 primary. `` But this is the year. We're going to carry it.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made his prediction of victory in the Republican bastion of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> _ going so far as to predict a victory over <PERSON> Georeg </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> there as well as statewide. His aides said they thought that was doubtful but said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> decided to stop in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> several weeks before the formal start of the fall campaign in hopes of minimizing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s expected local victory and thus make <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> easier to win. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor was wrapping up a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> swing today with stops in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> visit was in advance of the state's June 7 primary. But the decision to attend a barbeque in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which held its primary March 8, was made with the fall campaign in mind. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was expected to receive the endorsements of several locally prominent officials as he continues the process of unifying the party for the general election campaign. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' manuevering comes as fresh public opinion polls indcated he holds a substantial lead over the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice president. A <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Post-ABC survery published in Friday's editions reported the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor gaining the support of 53 percent of those polled to 40 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> dismissed the importance of the poll as he campaigned through <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Thursday insisting, for the record, that he still is concentrating on his final four primaries against <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> rival <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` It's not over yet,'' he said of his nominating struggle with his sole remaining opponent, even though he is expected to wrap up enough delegates on the final day of the primary season to clinch the nomination. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> used his time Thursday to depct himself as a progressive, future oriented candidate. He stopped at a company-sponsored day care center in <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, and issued a statement calling for expanded day care programs nationally. He told employees of a high-tech medical firm that he favors devoting a greater share of federal research and development funds to civilian work. He also made a brief tour of a facility in <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION> where lasers are developed for use in treatment of cancer and other disease, and he and his wife <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> used a laser beam to burn their names into a honeydew melon. In between, at a news conference, he renewed his demand for a `` full explanation'' of links between the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is under indictment on drug charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The vice president was asked a few weeks ago whether or not we were paying <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, he said ` I ca n't confirm or deny that.''' `` He's not running for press spokesman of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` He's suppose to be running for president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> should explain any links betwen the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` Who are the people that were involved in drug running and profit skimming and who was it in this administration who thought that made sense.''

<HEAD>Fetal Heart Rates Slow After Very Vigorous Maternal Exercise,
Study Finds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Exercise is good for pregnant women, but one-third of the 45 expectant mothers who pushed themselves to the limit in brief workouts slowed the heart rates of their unborn babies, researchers say. Whether diminished heart rates hurt fetuses is unclear, but it could deprive them of needed oxygen, researchers said in a study in today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Milder exercise does n't have the same effect, and the findings suggest that higher exercise levels than currently recommended are safe for pregnant women, said lead researcher Dr. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>. `` The study is encouraging that women can continue exercising during pregnancy at levels reminiscent of that before pregnancy,'' he said in a telephone interview Thursday. `` On the other hand, I would caution women against exceeding 145 to 150 heartbeats a minute -LRB- for their own heart rate -RRB- because we do n't know what effect it has on the fetus.'' The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Obstetricians </ORGANIZATION> and Gynecologists recommends that an expectant mother not exercise beyond a level that raises her heart rate to 140 beats per minute, <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> said. But that recommendation was largely precautionary, and `` we can give women a little more latitude than before,'' he said. The 45 women in the study were 4 -LCB- months to 7 -LCB- months pregnant, and had an average age of 29. Fetal heart rates were measured at moderate and maximum exercise levels by <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, physiologist <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sady </PERSON>, and other researchers at <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. They found that maximum exercise _ when women peddled stationary bicycles against increasing resistance until they were unwilling or unable to continue _ produced brief episodes of slowed heart rates in 15 fetuses. Two other fetuses experienced slowed heart rates linked to moderate exercise, they said. The researchers believe any oxygen shortage was mild because tests given the unborn babies 30 minutes after the initial measurements were normal. The slowed heart rates did not appear to give rise to later problems, the researchers said. Three of the 45 infants studied as fetuses died within five weeks of birth, but of apparently unrelated causes. Some of the study's subjects had exercised vigorously on a regular basis before becoming pregnant and some had not, but that did not appear to affect fetal heartbeats, the researchers said. Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a researcher at <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hershey </LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview that the most important consideration is tailoring the level of exercise to the individual.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's plans for random drug testing of all federal prison employees have been put on hold for three weeks more by a judge. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Weigel </PERSON> on Thursday extended the restraining order to June 16. The order had been sought in a lawsuit by the American Federation of Government Employees, the country's largest federal workers union. The testing was to have started last Monday. <PERSON> Weigel </PERSON> issued a temporary restraining order May 20, saying constitutional problems were raised by testing law-abiding employees not suspected of wrongdoing. The delay has triggered a hiring freeze by the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lepley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lepley </PERSON>, noting that the agency has tested job applicants since 1984, asked <PERSON> Weigel </PERSON> to exempt applicants from his order. The judge did not make an immediate decision. The program stems from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1986 order that federal employees in sensitive jobs receive drug testing. The prisons agency was one of the first agencies scheduled to begin testing and the first to order random tests for all employees on the theory that all hold sensitive jobs. The union, which claims 9,400 prison employees among its 750,000 members, contends in its suit that testing without suspicion of drug use by an individual violates constitional standards for unreasonable search. The suit also claims violations of federal laws forbidding discrimination against the handicapped and requiring that employee discipline be related to job performance. Union attorney <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said Thursday that the government's safety justifications were a smokescreen `` This program was not designed for safety,'' <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said. `` Testing was developed as a political reaction'' to administration frustration at its inability to curb drug importation, he said. `` Federal employees were an available scapegoat.'' <PERSON> Lepley </PERSON> acknowledged that testing does not directly measure inability to do a job, but said it could reveal the potential for abusing drugs, would discourage employees from using them and would help keep drugs out of prisons. Prison employees have a reduced expectation of privacy, he said. In a separate suit, the union has challenged the entire drug testing program, which would cover 345,000 employees in 40 agencies. Another suit was filed in the same court Thursday by an employee group, the <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, challenging plans for random drug testing of more than 9,600 teachers in schools run by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military dependents in 20 countries.

<TEXT>
 The government plans to renovate the ancient palace of the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> that overlooks the Tibetan capital of <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> _ at an estimated cost of $ 8 million, an official newspaper reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said portions of the <LOCATION> Potala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION> have been cracked or damaged by worms over the centuries. It said more than $ 1 million was spent on repairs in 1981, but that this was `` far from enough.'' The planned renovation will include repairs to 720 square feet of frescoes, the report said. The vast Potala Palace, which now includes hundreds of rooms stacked 13 stories high, was begun in the 7th century as a pavilion. It was greatly enlarged in the 17th century. It includes living quarters for the Dalai Lama, <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s traditional god-king, mausoleums of seven previous Dalai Lamas, ceremonial halls, treasure store rooms, government offices, a prison and a monastery Since 1959, however, when the current <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, only a few monks have been allowed to remain in the <LOCATION> Potala </LOCATION>, and it serves mainly as a museum for tourists. The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> fled <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> during a failed uprising by thousands of Tibetans against communist Chinese rule, imposed nine years earlier. Most of the temples and religious sites in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> were destroyed or badly damaged by radical bands of Red Guards during <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Cultural Revolution from 1966-76 <LOCATION> Tibetan </LOCATION> activists claim <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> is renovating the temples now to lure more foreigners to <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> and profit from their tourist dollars.

<HEAD>AZT Might Reduce Spread Of AIDS To Sexual Partners, Study Finds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 AZT could make AIDS patients less infectious to their sexual partners, according to researchers who found high levels of the virus-fighting drug in the semen of patients treated with it. However, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> researchers caution in today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> that larger and more detailed studies are needed to determine if AZT can reduce the risk of spreading the virus. `` Our worst scenario is that some patients taking AZT will decide that they no longer need to follow existing -LRB- safer-sex -RRB- recommendations,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Balfour </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> virologist and a member of the research team. Researchers are trying to learn whether the drug even lowers the amount of AIDS virus in the semen, said study author Dr. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, who is with the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. If so, said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, it raises the possibility that AZT could lower the risk of virus transmission to sexual partners. Health experts strongly urge people who even suspect that they may have the AIDS virus to forgo sexual intercourse, or at least to use a condom to reduce the risk of the virus spreading. At best, AZT probably would reduce, rather than eliminate, the risk of the virus spreading, and no one yet knows by how much, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> explained. The abstinence-or-condom recommendations are expected to continue as the first line of defense regardless of what further studies find, he added. Semen has been the primary means by which the AIDS virus has been transmitted since the epidemic began in 1981. Infected blood is the other major transmission route. AZT is not a cure for AIDS, but it's the only drug so far that has shown a clear-cut ability to extend some AIDS patients' lives. It is being taken by at least 25,000 people who have the AIDS virus, <PERSON> Balfour </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> study found that the level of AZT in six patients was typically several times higher in their semen than in their blood. These AZT levels would be enough to keep the virus from multiplying in a test tube, but <PERSON> Balfour </PERSON> said the results might be different in the body. In addition, the drug is n't designed to get rid of all the virus, only to keep it from growing, he said. Three of the patients in the study have AIDS, and three others were ill with less severe symptoms called ARC, or AIDS-related complex. The study was the first major look at how AZT concentrates in body fluids other than blood, the researchers said.

 The death toll from flooding in southeast <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> rose to 131, including five people who died after a new rainstorm in <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> province, official reports said today. The <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported that 91 people were dead and more than 650 injured in coastal <LOCATION> Fujian </LOCATION> province, up from the previous toll of 82 dead and 436 injured. <LOCATION> Fujian </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jiangxi </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Hunan </PERSON> provinces were hit with heavy rains May 19-21. Three people died in <LOCATION> Jiangxi </LOCATION> and 32 in <LOCATION> Hunan </LOCATION>.

The <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said heavy rains fell Tuesday and Wednesday in northern areas of <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> province, killing five people, injuring more than 370 and leaving three missing. Government officials rushed to the region to help relocate 8,000 people from heavily flooded areas, <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said. It said 12 inches of rain fell on one <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION>, Fugang, during the two-day storm, causing 2,150 houses to collapse and flooding 6,422 acres of farmland. The English-language <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said the rains damaged part of the <LOCATION> Beijing-Canton </LOCATION> railway line in northern <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION>. Rail service was halted for about six hours early Wednesday until repairs were made, it said. The <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> described damage in <LOCATION> Fujian </LOCATION> as much more devastating than previously estimated. It said nearly 100,000 homes collapsed and 823,745 acres of farmland were flooded, wiping out the crops in more than half the area. The news agency estimated direct economic losses in <LOCATION> Fujian </LOCATION> at $ 53.8 million. The heavy rains that have hit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s east coast have not helped drought-stricken inland provinces, especially those in north-central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> such as <LOCATION> Gansu </LOCATION>, where a drought has lasted nearly two years.

 A top Soviet arms control official today called on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to speed up negotiations on a treaty to cut long-range nuclear arsenals by making good on promises of compromise. <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s arms control department and a former chief negotiator at <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> arms talks, told the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had agreed to compromise on several key issues, but then backed off. `` As soon as an issue reaches the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> delegation in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, it gets stuck there,'' <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> complained.

 Iranian troops were busy building new fortifications east of this tiny frontier post after <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> drove them back into their own territory in a lightning attack east of the port city of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>. Reporters on a government-organized tour of the war front Thursday saw the bodies of dozens of Iranian soldiers scattered on this dusty plain along with their light weapons, rocket-propelled grenade launchers and hand grenades. A field hospital built in a trench and well protected with concrete walls was abandoned. Its equipment was scattered on the floor along with more bodies of Iranian soldiers. Reporters were shown a small number of Iranian prisoners of war, some in their mid-teens, others in their 60s. <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> officers would not let reporters speak to them. From this border post 10 miles east of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, Iranian troops were visible in the distance, hastily building new fortifications. The Iraqi officers said their forces, led by elite Presidential Guards, routed the Iranians in a five-pronged offensive launched Wednesday morning that lasted 10 hours. A senior officer, speaking on condition his name and rank not be divulged, said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> troops backed by tanks, artillery, jet fighters and helicopter gunships retook 50 square miles of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> territory. The attack was spearheaded by tanks, part of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s heavily mechanized armed forces, and faced more lightly armed but sometimes fanatical Iranian Revolutionary Guards and volunteers. The officer said those Iranian troops that were n't killed or wounded `` fled to the other side of the border.'' This observation post is where the Iranians pushed their troops into <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in a January 1987 offensive that eventually petered out just six miles from <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>. The southern city, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s second largest, is also its only sea port. Iranian army jeeps, trucks and ammunition stocks, some in good shape, were abandoned by the Iranians along tracks they had built to approach their main defense points. Western military analysts estimated that between 35,000 and 40,000 Iraqi troops took part in this week's offensive, but reliable casualty estimates were not yet available. Reporters counted 400 Iranian prisoners of war being held here. The analysts say about 25,000 Iranians were believed killed in the 1987 offensive and perhaps 10,000 Iraqis. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has gone on the offensive recently after more than two years of defensive tactics in the war, which began in September 1980. On April 18, <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> forces retook the <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, which had been in Iranian hands since February 1986.

 <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> built a special chapel for his wedding last month to <PERSON> Loni </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and hired a special caterer and a motorized stagecoach. But then he forgot where he put the marriage license. `` He called us the day before the wedding and said he could n't seem to find it,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> clerk of courts `` He wanted to know what to do.'' <PERSON> Dunkle </PERSON> had personally delivered the marriage license application to <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> at his Jupiter ranch March 2. The application is good for 60 days. <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Loni </PERSON> were married on the 57th day. All Reynolds had to do was get the minister and two witnesses to sign the license after the ceremony. That is, if he could find it. <PERSON> Dunkle </PERSON> told him a duplicate could be supplied. Marriage License Supervisor <PERSON> Lynda </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> stayed in the office all day April 29, the day of the wedding, waiting for <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> to call. `` I wanted to take the duplicate up there. I wanted to go to the wedding,'' she said. `` My phone did n't ring the whole day.'' Someone in <PERSON> Dunkle </PERSON>'s office later sent <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> a duplicate. One of Reynolds' assistants, <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, is mailing it around so the best man and another witness can sign it. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> are officially married, <PERSON> Dunkle </PERSON> said. They just ca n't prove it.

 <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> will be back on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> in separate new series this fall, but `` <ORGANIZATION> Cagney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Lacey'' are gone. Also canceled are `` Houston Knights,'' `` High Mountain Rangers,'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Eisenhower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON>'' and `` The <ORGANIZATION> Smothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hour </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` The decision to cancel the Emmy-winning drama ` <ORGANIZATION> Cagney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON>' was a close call and was not made until Tuesday,'' said CBS President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> LeMasters </PERSON> `` But the show had suffered the slings and arrows. We felt it was time for it to go off before it got beaten up more.'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Cagney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON>'' was canceled in 1983, but <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> brought it back after a letter-writing campaign by fans. The critically praised series `` Frank's Place'' is n't in the fall lineup, but <PERSON> LeMasters </PERSON> said it would return next season as soon as there is a protected time period where it can stay put. `` Kate & amp; <PERSON> Allie </PERSON>'' and `` <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> and the Fatman'' are also being held until later in the season. Taking `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s Place'' off the schedule was `` one of the toughest decisions I had to make,'' said <PERSON> LeMasters </PERSON>. `` It's an extraordinary show. But what it boiled down to was, would I put it on the schedule to be bounced around, or would I take the heat and hold it for an advantageous time period?'' Other shows that were new in 1987 that did make the second-season slate were `` Coming of Age,'' a mid-season replacement, `` Wiseguy,'' `` Beauty and the Beast'' and `` Tour of Duty.'' <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> has already announced that its new season will begin a month late, in October, because of the strike by the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. When it does get underway, there will be new comedies from <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON>, who played husband and wife in the popular 1960s sitcom `` The <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> Show.'' This time they'll have separate shows, but they'll air back-to-back on Wednesdays In her show, yet to be named, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> will play a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> divorcee. In `` The <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> Show,'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> plays a Broadway star trying to help his more cerebral son, played by <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON>'s real-life son, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, keep a struggling theater group going The network has added several new comedies to the schedule in an effort to draw younger viewers. Among these is `` Dirty Dancing,'' based on the hit movie of the same name. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Melora </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> will play the <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Swayze-Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Grey </PERSON> roles. <PERSON> Candice </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergen </PERSON> will make her television series debut in `` <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>,'' playing a big star from a popular network news show. Other news shows are: _ `` Close to Home,'' half-hour comedy starring <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Naughton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Royana </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mirian </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinovich </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, about a father and teen-age daughter -LRB- <PERSON> Naughton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Black </PERSON> -RRB- adjusting to life with mom, who has left to `` discover'' herself. _ `` Almost Grown,'' one-hour drama about three decades in the life of a marriage with emphasis on music, starring <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Daly </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> as the couple who meet and marry in the'60s. _ `` Paradise,'' one-hour drama set in the 1890s starring <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Horsley </PERSON> as a gunfighter who inherits his sister's four young children. _ `` TV 101,'' one-hour drama starring <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Robards </PERSON> as a journalism teacher who returns to his old high school to teach television reporting. `` <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON>,'' `` Close to Home,'' `` TV 101'' are the first series from <ORGANIZATION> GTG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>, Grant Tinker's new production company. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> was celebrating the retention of the all three hours of prime-time news programming. It had been rumored last week that either `` 48 Hours'' or `` West 57th'' would have to go. `` 60 Minutes'' is a top-10 show. But when the schedule was announced, all three shows were in the lineup, in their same time periods. <PERSON> LeMasters </PERSON> said the decision had nothing to do with the writers strike _ news show writers are in a different union _ and the shows were retained strictly on the basis of merit Here is the CBS prime-time schedule for the fall: Monday: `` <PERSON> Newhart </PERSON>,'' `` Coming of Age,'' `` <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>,'' `` Designing Women,'' `` Almost Grown.'' Tuesday: `` TV 101,'' `` CBS Tuesday Movie.''

<TEXT>
 Muscovites polled on the eve of the summit between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> showed a lingering mistrust of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policies and found <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> a puzzle, according to a poll published today. Of the 939 <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> adults surveyed this month for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, 52 percent said `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policies present a threat to the security of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' Twenty-nine percent said they did not. Residents of the Soviet capital find <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> puzzling, according to the telephone poll. More said their impressions were favorable than unfavorable, 24 percent to 18 percent, but about half did not venture an opinion. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> are to meet next week in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The respondents were firmly behind <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s drive to improve the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Seventy-eight percent supported his domestic policies completely, and 19 percent less than completely. However, many of those surveyed reacted warily to telephone questions from strangers in a country where historically a freely expressed opinion could mean time in a Siberian labor camp, the Times said. Others seemed to reply mechanically with responses they deemed politically correct. The interviews were conducted by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sociological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> on May 7, 8, 14 and 15. The margin of error for the poll was 4 percentage points, meaning results could vary 4 points either way. Respondents especially liked <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s calls for greater democracy and openness. Many said they wanted liberalization to include competitive elections, private publishing and tolerance of public demonstrations, the Times said. However, only about half said they have seen tangible benefits from his program of economic reform. Only 40 percent said they expected their expected their families' standard of living to improve in the next five years. Eighteen percent predicted it would worsen.

 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s foreign minister criticized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions against his country during an interview on American television, but his apartheid opponent, Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, called for tougher steps. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roelof </PERSON> `` Pik'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, the Noble Peace Prize-winning Anglican prelate, were interviewed separately on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nightline'' show Thursday. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> criticized the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for failing to take tougher steps against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to induce that country to abandon apartheid, the policy of racial separation. `` We are saying, ` Look, in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, many of the things that you hold dear are being treated with considerable disdain. Why do n't you do something that will indicate to the South African government and to the victims that you actually do mean what you say?''' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, meanwhile, claimed that `` in general, black South Africans have more effective civil rights than black Americans.'' `` You do not want to have a proper analysis of our dilemma,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said. `` You simply ascribe to us the worst motives. We appeal to the black Americans to try to understand that in many instances black South Africans enjoy better medical facilities, better housing facilities, better education and greater prospects of power-sharing than black Americans will ever enjoy.'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said that despite the South African government's relaxation or elimination of some apartheid policies, `` those steps have not come about as a result of any significant conversion on their part. ... Political power still remains very firmly in the hands of the white minority and until we deal with that problem we are playing marbles.'' Responding to a question about whether economic sanctions were effective, he said, `` if in fact sanctions are as ineffective as we are being led to believe, why are the South African government, the private sector ... jumping around like scalded cats, as if they had ants in their pants?'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> argued that the sanctions and the withdrawal of some industries `` mean robbing our black people of jobs, of sending their families into starvation.'' He claimed a poll had shown that 75 percent of his country's blacks opposed sanctions When asked why the government would not allow blacks to express such views by allowing them to vote, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> denied that blacks are being denied political power.

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigration official says <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> should be allowed to return to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> for his mother's funeral, a remark that drew a rebuke from a Philippine official. The deposed <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> president reiterated his desire to return to his homeland as he ended a two-day stay Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for treatment of chest pains. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezell </PERSON>, regional commissioner for the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, met with <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' chief spokesman, <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Aruiza </PERSON>, shortly afterward and said he thought <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> should be allowed to attend his mother's burial. `` Whether or not you agree with everything that's happened, there is still a factor that <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is a human being who had a mother who has passed away,'' <PERSON> Ezell </PERSON> said after accepting a letter from <LOCATION> Aruiza </LOCATION> requesting approval for the return. `` The politics _ the government decisions _ sometimes have to be weighed separately from that,'' he said. But, <PERSON> Ezell </PERSON> said, the final decision rests with <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has refused to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> back, calling him a national security risk. The Philippine consul general in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> criticized <PERSON> Ezell </PERSON>. `` I thought his behavior was rather irregular,'' said <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>. `` He is a public official who is supposed to react to a bureaucratic process; he did n't have to editorialize.'' <PERSON> Ezell </PERSON> said he sympathized with <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' situation because <PERSON> Ezell </PERSON>'s father died about a year ago Before his release from the hospital, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> told reporters that Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> should back down from her claim that he poses a threat. `` I've told them I will not bother them ... but will hold back the people from starting violence,'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said while seated in a wheelchair. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, 70, was accompanied by his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, several aides, a nurse and his physician, Dr. <PERSON> Azucena </PERSON> <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON>, who said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was fit to travel. <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> said arthritis or inflammation in the area of the left sixth rib caused <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' chest pains. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> improved dramatically with rest and was being treated with a painkiller, she said. <PERSON> Aruiza </PERSON>'s letter contained a list of 71 people for whom <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> wants officials to grant permission to go to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> for the funeral of <PERSON> Josefa </PERSON> <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON>, who died May 4 at age 95. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> district director, said the 71 also requested permission to re-enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> if allowed to travel to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is under `` a prevent departure notice,'' which means he needs permission to leave the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ezell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> said the letter would be forwarded to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for consideration. Included in the list were <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, his wife, son <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and daughter <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Araneta </PERSON>. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would not consider any <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> trip without the approval of the Aquino government. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deportation </ORGANIZATION>, 16 of the 71 on the list are covered by a `` hold order'' that prevents them from leaving the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> should they return.

<HEAD>Man Who Shot Ailing Wife Sentenced To Prison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A retired farmer who admitted killing his wife to end her suffering from Alzheimer's disease wept as he asked a judge to place him in a nursing home instead of sending him to prison. But the judge, apparently unmoved, on Thursday sentenced <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, 78, to serve at least 28 months of a 43-month prison sentence for the Feb. 29 shooting of his 71-year-old wife, <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON>, in an <LOCATION> Evansville </LOCATION> nursing home. `` I have n't got many years left, maybe not many days, either,'' <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said before sentencing, his voice faltering. `` I hope you will put me in a home, someplace where I can be of some good to somebody.'' <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> that he was `` so sorry'' for what happened to his wife of 45 years. He was to begin serving his time at the <LOCATION> Stillwater </LOCATION> state prison as soon as his transfer could be arranged from the <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail, said defense attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON>. `` He's a frail old man placed in a system with violent people,'' said <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON>. However, <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrott </PERSON> said, `` Justice was served by the fact he was imprisoned.'' With good behavior, <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> would be eligible for parole in 28 months. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> pleaded guilty several weeks ago to second-degree murder after <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said he would consider a prison sentence of no more than 43 months, or 28 months with good behavior. The agreement departs from state sentencing guidelines, which call for an 18-year sentence for second-degree murder. Ms. <PERSON> Carrott </PERSON> opposed even the 43-month sentence. Although she said she felt compassion toward <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, she said she believes sentencing guidelines should be followed. The prosecutor said defense attorneys did not confer with her on the plea arrangement, and said sentencing <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> to anything less than 18 years would set a dangerous precedent. However, <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>'s other attorney, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Reif </PERSON>, said, `` We're talking about a man who's never even had a traffic ticket before this I do not think sending him to prison at his age would serve society at all.'' During a pre-sentence hearing, <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said he snapped when he learned Feb. 28 that his wife had broken her hip and would have to be hospitalized. The next day, he took an old pistol to the <LOCATION> Crestview </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nursing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Home </LOCATION>, and shot her four times. `` I just cracked up. I just could n't take no more,'' <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said. Relatives said the <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> family was devastated by Mrs. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>'s death, but had forgiven <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>. `` He's still our father and we understand it was hard on him,'' said <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> <PERSON> Penuel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>'s youngest daughter.

<HEAD>Friend of Dann's Committed to Psychiatric Ward After Arrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINNETKA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A female friend of <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>, who killed one child and wounded six people during a shooting rampage, has been charged with making harassing telephone calls similar to the ones <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> was accused of, police said. <PERSON> Sheri </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, 34, of suburban <LOCATION> Highwood </LOCATION> was arrested at the local convenience store where she worked and later surrendered a .357 Magnum handgun she kept in the hotel room where she lived, <LOCATION> Winnetka </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Timm </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> was charged with threatening her former husband over the telephone, <PERSON> Timm </PERSON> said. Before her death Friday, <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> had also been accused of threatening her ex-husband. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> was arrested late Wednesday by a local-county task force investigating <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>'s background, <PERSON> Timm </PERSON> said. She was involuntarily committed to a psychiatric unit at Rush-Presbyterian-St. <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> for `` We should let the psychiatrists examine her and then decide what should be done,'' said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state's attorney's office. Last Friday, <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> started a small fire in a home, shot six children at <ORGANIZATION> Hubbard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, killing one, and then shot and wounded a 20-year-old man at a nearby home. She then shot and killed herself. At a news conference, <PERSON> Timm </PERSON> identified <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> `` as a very close friend of <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>.'' He said <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s ex-husband had warned that `` she might be a threat to him, to herself and this community.'' `` It was extremely obvious that this was a serious situation. We are concerned with the safety of the <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> family. ... We wanted to prevent another tragedy,'' <PERSON> Timm </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> had been roommates about a year ago and also had a distant family connection, said Assistant State's Attorney <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>. <PERSON> Timm </PERSON> said there is no evidence that <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> had any connection with <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>'s violent rampage or helped her make threatening calls. `` We are in the process of determining the extent of Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s involvement with <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Timm </PERSON> said. In another development Thursday, an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> apparently acted alone in obtaining the poison she used to lace about two dozen packages of snacks and juice that she sent or delivered to acquaintances before going on her <LOCATION> Winnetka </LOCATION> shooting spree. `` Nobody else has surfaced as an accomplice based on the investigation we did here,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinmetz </PERSON>, supervisor of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s Madison office. Authorities are investigating whether <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> sent her former husband, <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>, an envelope containing fruit juice that was found Wednesday at a Highland Park post office. Also Thursday, one of the children shot by <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> was released from <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, and the most seriously injured victim, 8-year-old <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, was upgraded to fair condition. Two other children were in good condition at the hospital. Two other shooting victims were in fair condition at <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> was arrested on two outstanding warrants _ on a new charge of threatening the life of her ex-husband, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, and their children, who live with their father, and an old charge of failing to appear on a drunken driving charge in <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Timm </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s ex-husband signed the complaint against her because he was concerned about his family's safety and feared that <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> might harm herself, <LOCATION> Winnetka </LOCATION> Police Sgt. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalvaitis </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>New Program Criticizes Militarism, Calls For Purge Of Bureaucrats</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> says the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has in the past wrongly stressed military over diplomatic solutions to world problems and that its foreign policy is no longer dogmatic. A position paper approved by the 300-plus member body also sharply criticizes the role the party has come to occupy in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> society, saying bureaucrats are too often impeding the effectiveness of government bodies. It proposes limiting party officials to two five-year terms, with exceptions that could include <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, and says elections for party jobs should be by secret ballot with more than one candidate. The report will serve as the foundation for an extraordinary party conference that begins June 28, the first such gathering since 1941. Its details were distributed Thursday by the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency. Approved Monday, it sets the agenda for a possible showdown between reformers led by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and conservatives resisting change. The report says foreign policy before <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power `` trailed behind fundamental changes that occurred in the world and missed chances to reduce tensions and enhance understanding among nations.'' Praising changes made by the Soviet leader, it said <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> foreign policy now addresses problems of a world faced with nuclear destruction while `` not imposing any conditions or dogmas on anyone.'' The new Soviet approach has led to a `` definite improvement'' in relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and a `` fresh discovery'' of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in other countries, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> report says. `` In our bid for military-strategic parity we occassionally failed to use opportunities available to attain security for our nation by political means, and, as a result, allowed ourselves to be lured into an arms race which could not but affect this country's social and economic progress and its standing on the international scene,'' the report says. On domestic policy, the program strongly reflects <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s priorities for increasing citizen involvement in public affairs and making individuals more accountable Its passage shows that the man who rose to party chief in March 1985 was able to muster the vital support of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was named to present the party program at the meeting next month at which 5,000 delegates will pass judgment on his reforms. The program indicates the Communists still lay claim to being the most important force in Soviet society and the only legal political party. But it says Communist authorities have seriously weakened local governing bodies and the party itself by seeking to dominate nearly all aspects of life. `` The rights and powers of the representative bodies have been curtailed and they remain under unwarranted tutelage from party committees,'' the report says, with governing councils often left to rubber-stamp decisions already made at higher levels. The result has `` sharpened many social development problems,'' the report said. `` It is vital to change this situation radically.'' The report says changes must extend to the Supreme Soviet, the nominal parliament which finished a three-day session in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> on Thursday. Party documents call for an increase in the number of days the governing councils work, urge that members be relieved of work obligations to attend such sessions and that the meetings be open to the public and the media. The report indicates that those who do not support <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms will be purged from the 19 million-member party <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in January 1987 called on the party to implement procedures to ensure that new blood is brought into the leadership, but he ran into resistance.

<HEAD>Cardinal Renews Opposition To Euthanasia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cardinal <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernardin </PERSON> urged Roman Catholics and non-Catholics to oppose efforts to legalize euthanasia, but said opponents must work for alternatives for the incurably ill such as hospices. `` As individuals and as a society, we have the positive obligation to protect life,'' <PERSON> Bernardin </PERSON> said in a speech Thursday to the Center for Clinical Medical Ethics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals </ORGANIZATION> and Clinics. `` We have the negative obligation not to destroy or injure human life directly, especially the life of the innocent and vulnerable.'' <PERSON> Bernardin </PERSON> suggested that funding for hospice programs in hospitals or patients' homes could come from insurance or public sources. `` In this way we can eliminate many of the legitimate concerns that may motivate people to consider euthanasia, which otherwise would be unacceptable to them and society,'' he said. The cardinal said his position against mercy killing does not include keeping alive by extraordinary medical procedures or machines `` those who should be allowed a natural death.'' He said he was `` convinced that we are not morally obliged to do everything that is technically possible'' to keep terminally ill patients alive. `` In other words, there are cases where we would not be obliged to provide nutrition and hydration. He said the challenge was to develop a public policy `` to protect against an attitude that could erode respect for the inviolable dignity of human life.'' But such a policy should not create categories or priorities of people `` whose lives no longer need be protected,'' he said. The cardinal said his remarks were prompted by the increased public discussion of euthanasia following advances in medical technology that can artificially prolong a patient's life. The issue has been widely debated since the Chicago-based Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> published a letter in January by an anonymous doctor describing the mercy killing of a terminally ill cancer patient. `` The fear, then, of the pain and discomfort of a life prolonged inappropriately has led to an erosion of the natural instinct to preserve one's life,'' the cardinal said. `` In certain critical decisions involving living and dying, many perceive that the focus of concern many no longer be the good of the patient'' but what will best protect the doctor and hospital from legal action, he said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense ministers today pledged to renew efforts to share equitably in the costs of their common defense. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been complaining that the European allies are not pulling their weight. `` We are determined ... in ensuring that each of us contributes in the most effective and equitable fashion'' to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s joint defense efforts, the ministers said in a statement at the end of their two-day meeting here. They authorized <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> to launch an in-depth review of the responsibilities of the 16 member nations to determine what changes, if any, must be made. The study is to be completed by the end of the year. In their statement, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and the other <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> defense chiefs also expressed support for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in his summit talks next week in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The review of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s burden-sharing arrangement comes amid increasingly harsh criticism from some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lawmakers, criticism the <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies counter by saying their contributions are being grossly underestimated. `` The important thing about burden-sharing is that it not degenerate to a finger-pointing exercise,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> told reporters after the meeting. He said all <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations are committed to maintaining their defense spending and making better use of available funds. The ministers also asked <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to host a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jetfighter wing that <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> wants off its soil within three years. `` All of us hope that the Italian government and parliament will be able to accept'' the 72 nuclear-capable F-16 jetfighters, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General Lord <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> said. A favorable Italian decision is expected soon. The planes, <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> said, represent `` a considerable portion of our strength in the southern region.'' They make up the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s 401st Tactical Fighter Wing, now based at the <LOCATION> Torrejon </LOCATION> air base near <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. The Pentagon has said it will have to disband the unit unless a final decision on moving the planes to another <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> base is made by August. <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> told reporters that hesitation by the allies in arranging the transfer of the F-16s `` would have had the most appalling effect'' on alliance relations and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressional attitudes toward <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. A decision on a specific Italian site for the planes is to be made later. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> estimated the cost of relocating the planes at about $ 500 million. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, under an accord reached in January with <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, must remove its F-16s from the <LOCATION> Torrejon </LOCATION> base by 1991. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were hopeful the decision to keep the F-16s in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> would help blunt congressional complaints the Europeans do n't pay enough for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> spends 6.7 percent of its gross national product to maintain the alliance, compared with a 3.3 percent average for the Europeans. The European allies argue a comparison of money figures is unfair because some of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s contributions to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> are hard to quantify. These include the fact that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and other countries suffer extensive environmental damage from the intense concentration of troops and armaments on their soil. The Europeans have released figures showing that of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s active duty forces, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> provides 90 percent of the troops and artillery, 80 percent of the tanks and jetfighters and two-thirds of the major warships The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense ministers said they have found no evidence <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is changing `` the doctrine and structure of Soviet forces.'' The ministers said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> continues to maintain military forces in excess of its defensive needs. `` Soviet military expenditures are estimated to represent some 15 to 17 percent of its GNP. The continuing growth of Soviet military capabilities provides a persuasive reminder of the need for a credible defense'' on <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s part, the ministers said in their communique. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said, `` Despite their rhetoric, we have yet to see any change'' in Soviet military outlays or in the composition of Soviet forces.

<TEXT>
 The body of a reputed mobster was found in a body bag floating in the <LOCATION> Hackensack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, with two bullet holes behind his ear and a credit card left behind to signal his identity, authorities said. The body of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> DiGilio </PERSON>, a flamboyant ex-boxer who was a friend of heavyweight champions <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON>, was found in the river by the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Carlstadt </LOCATION> on Thursday, said <LOCATION> Bergen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>. `` Sometimes when you live by the sword, you die by the sword,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronster </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attorney who prosecuted <PERSON> DiGilio </PERSON> in a recent waterfront racketeering case. The corpse was decomposed beyond recognition, but <PERSON> DiGilio </PERSON> was wearing the same clothes he had on when his wife reported him missing May 7 and authorities were able to confirm his identity through fingerprints, <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> said. After the 55-year-old <LOCATION> Bayonne </LOCATION> man was reported missing, authorities said their sources indicated the reputed Genovese crime family soldier had been the victim of gangland violence. The former longshoreman was a colorful figure who frequently spoke with reporters, successfully acted as his own attorney in the racketeering case, often invited his boxing friends to the courtroom and filed a harassment suit against federal officials. Authorities believe that flamboyance may have prompted mob colleagues unhappy with the attention to seek <PERSON> DiGilio </PERSON>'s elimination. <PERSON> DiGilio </PERSON> was also to be sentenced on a state loan-sharking conviction May 19. His body was found inside a zipped mortician's bag, with two bullet holes behind the ear, state police said. A Visa card was found between <PERSON> DiGilio </PERSON>'s legs so that whoever recovered the body would be able to identify it, said <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>. Mob experts have said it was likely <PERSON> DiGilio </PERSON>'s death would be made known to serve as a warning to others. Authorities alleged the former middleweight boxer controlled loan sharking and labor rackets on the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> waterfront, and had extended his influence into <LOCATION> Bergen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> to the north. Last April, a jury acquitted him of extorting money from a stevedore company on the <LOCATION> Bayonne </LOCATION> waterfront in exchange for labor peace. <PERSON> DiGilio </PERSON> was convicted of loan sharking last October after remaining free for 10 years through a series of delays, most of them connected to claims of ill health and mental instability. He was cleared in 1986 of violating a probationary sentence for his 1975 conviction for arranging the theft of his <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> file, his only other conviction. He served nine months in jail for the file theft.

 A `` little miracle'' who barely filled an adult's hand when she was born 17 weeks premature last January should be able to leave the hospital in about two weeks, doctors say. <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> seems to have escaped the problems that often plague premature babies, doctors said Thursday. <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, who weighed just 15 -LCB- ounces at birth, now weighs 3 pounds 15 -LCB- ounces and measures 16 \ inches She has color in her cheeks, can hold her head up and cries frequently, although very softly. When she was born, doctors were uncertain whether she would survive more than a few days. Had things gone according to plan, <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> would have been born today. `` She's really a little miracle,'' said <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, a nurse in the neonatal intensive care unit at <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>'s home since birth. <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> should go home in about two weeks, said Dr. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoekstra </PERSON>, a specialist on newborns at the hospital. The smallest premature infant to survive in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> weighed 15 ounces, according to <PERSON> Hoekstra </PERSON>. Although <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>'s eyes are not fully developed, doctors do n't believe she will have any problems with sight She has not experienced any hemorrhaging in her brain, another common problem with premature babies, and does n't appear to have any serious breathing difficulties, though she lived on a respirator for 77 days. Her skin, thin at birth, has developed and will protect her from infection, <PERSON> Hoekstra </PERSON> said. It appears she will live a normal, healthy life, although her progress will be monitored by doctors periodically until she is 7, <PERSON> Hoekstra </PERSON> said. Five years ago, <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> probably would not have lived long enough to go home, <PERSON> Hoekstra </PERSON> said. He said technological advances and better-trained doctors have made it possible to treat infants such as <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>'s grandmother, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>, said she ca n't count the prayers she and family members have said for <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> in the past four anxiety-filled months. <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>'s medical bills stand at about $ 224,000, and will be covered by insurance, hospital officials said.

 <LOCATION> HELSINKI </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, emerging from pre-summit isolation, today appealed to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to enter the Western `` House of Democracy'' by embracing the values enshrined in the 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> agreement. Sounding the human rights theme he will stress in their talks in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s `` glasnost'' and the openness that has flourished in his three years at the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> helm. But while dissidents are released from labor camps and books and movies criticizing the communist system gain currency, the president said, `` Soviet practice does not _ or does not yet _ measure up to <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> commitment.'' In the 1975 accord with 34 other nations, the Soviets pledged to provide more liberty for their people and those in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. And yet, 13 years later, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, the cases of divided families and blocked marriages remain on the <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> agenda, while Russians trying to emigrate are subjected to artificial quotas and arbitrary rulings. `` And what are we to think of the continued suppression of those who wish to practice their religious beliefs?'' the president asked. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spoke in a prepared speech to a Finnish audience in <LOCATION> Finlandia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Final Agreement was signed in 1975. He said he welcomed every sign that the Soviets and their allies are ready to adopt Western values. `` The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> is a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> whose doors are open to all,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. As he spoke, Jewish groups gathered in the Finnish capital to mount public pressure on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in behalf of Sovie Jews waiting for exit permits and those seeking wider latitude to teach and practice their religion. A Friday evening Sabbath service was planned outside a Lutheran church in an ecumencial display of unity.

 Before the speech, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, had lunch with Finnish President <PERSON> Mauno </PERSON> <PERSON> Koivisto </PERSON>. As photographers spun into action, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> plucked yellow daisies from the luncheon flower arrangement. The president proudly wore one as a boutonniere and Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> pinned one on <PERSON> Koivisto </PERSON>'s lapel <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> played down the significance of the Soviet decision to cancel one of his meetings with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` We only had four meetings at our summit in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' he told reporters. `` We have to recognize that their government has normal business that has to be conducted and we have to schedule accordingly _ that's what we did when the summit was in our town. Asked if he thought there was anything more important than his visit with the Soviet leader, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` I do n't think there's anything more important as far as I'm concerned, but they have business to do. The president, responding to questions about Soviets objections to some of the people he planned on meeting with in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, responded simply, `` We do the best we can.'' In other summit-related developments. _ A top Soviet arms control official in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> called on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to speed up negotiations on a treaty to cut long-range nuclear arsenals by making good on promises of compromise <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s arms control department and a former chief negotiator at <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> arms talks, told the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had agreed to compromise on several key issues, but then backed off. `` As soon as an issue reaches the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> delegation in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, it gets stuck there,'' he complained. _ And an aide to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> charged that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is violating a peace accord by continuing to ship arms to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s anti-communist <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas. `` They are arming, quite openly, those who want to go on in their civil war,'' said <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Primakov </PERSON>, who is head of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economy </ORGANIZATION> and has acted as a key adviser to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spoke, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Jewish activists for Soviet Jews urged the president to remind the Soviets that human rights were indirectly linked to progress in arms control. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abram </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewry </ORGANIZATION>, said Jewish emigration is a `` test of whether arms reductions can succeed.'' Any agreement `` depends on trust and credibility,'' he told a news conference. `` No one asks for direct linkage.'' <PERSON> Abram </PERSON> called the improvement in Jewish emigration figures `` insignificant compared with those who wish to leave ... It's smoke and mirrors as far as the the right to leave is concerned. The council, an umbrella organization of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Jewish groups active for Soviet Jewry, brought a 50-member delegation to <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> to draw attention to the issue. The 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> agreement signed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and 33 European nations including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> initially was viewed skeptically by <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> political conservatives because it implicitly accepts East European boundaries set after World War II in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s favor. But in the years since, the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> agreement has served as a Western platform for chastising the Soviets for deficiencies on human rights. Meanwhile, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> today moved toward ratification of the historic treaty that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed at their December summit eliminating medium range nuclear missiles. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders said they had the votes to approve the pact. White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was set to rush the treaty to the president for a ceremonial exchange of the ratification documents with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Human rights is one of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s themes in his fourth summit with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The president plans to meet Monday with Soviet activists and refuseniks to underscore his concern. Word reached the presidential party Thursday that the Soviets had questioned the participation of one of the religious groups scheduled to meet with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at the <PERSON> Danilov </PERSON> monastery on Monday. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he did not know which religious group the Soviets objected to. The meeting, said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, `` is still on as far as I know.'' On the official level, the Soviets have shown no concern over the meeting. At a press conference Thursday to discuss the summit, Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> said, `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president ... is certainly free to decide who of Soviet citizens he finds interesting and useful to meet with outside the framework of the official events.'' But, he added, `` This American move is hardly aimed at improving mutual understanding between the <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> and U.S.S.R.'' Refuseniks demonstrating in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Thursday said they want human rights to figure prominently in the Reagan-Gorbachev meetings. A <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> refusenik, <PERSON> Roald </PERSON> `` Alec'' Zelichonok, said in a telephone interview that <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> secret police has warned him against accepting an invitation to meet <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Monday. <PERSON> Zelichonok </PERSON>, who has been refused permission to emigrate for more than 10 years, said he received a letter and telephone call Tuesday from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> inviting him to take part in the meeting with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Shortly after the embassy phone call, he said, a <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> officer telephoned and said `` in light of security measures around <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, my departure for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will not be permitted.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in a pre-summit interview with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> journalists, said he hopes to work out an agreement with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to give <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> psychiatrists access to Soviet mental hospitals. Human rights groups have charged dissidents are committed and mistreated. Other advances in human rights at the summit were hinted by Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> in a meeting in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. American officials said they reforms would probably ease restraints on religious practices and education.

 Following the collapse of its negotiating effort, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is promoting a more active role for the Central American democracies in encouraging Panamanian leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to surrender power. `` I think it's an excellent idea,'' said Undersecretary of State <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON>, noting that several Central American countries `` have a tremendous storehouse of experience in the transition to civilian democratic rule.'' <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s third-ranking official, spoke Thursday evening on the `` MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour'' after a day marked by high-level consultations in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and in a number of Latin American capitals. Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said earlier that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassadors from around the hemisphere were instructed to sound out host governments on their ideas for negotiating a solution in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was the subject of a senior level meeting Thursday at the White House as well. A unilateral <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort to negotiate <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out of power failed on Wednesday when the Defense Forces commander and de facto ruler backed out of a deal his representatives had negotiated with <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON>. During a photo session in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> today with Finnish President <PERSON> Mauno </PERSON> <PERSON> Henrik </PERSON> <PERSON> Koivisto </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> indicated that he and his advisers have reached no decisions about how to proceed on the Panamanian problem. `` We have had no opportunity to consider where we go,'' he said in response to reporters' questions. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also side-stepped a question as to whether he would use military force in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` I ca n't answer as to what might be the possibilities,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, saying it would be wrong to talk about options. Pressed to respond to <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>' refusal to rule out the use of military force, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said again, `` I wo n't comment on the possibilities.'' As part of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan to restore <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> rule in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> next year, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was to step down this August and go into temporary exile. In return, federal drug smuggling indictments against him were to be dismissed. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s rejection of the plan ended the negotiations and appeared to breathe new life into a Central American initiative in which Guatemalan President <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> apparently would play the key role. Panamanian Ambassador <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, who is allied with the anti-Noriega forces, told reporters after a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials that diplomatic contacts had been made with <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION> after the collapse of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort. <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION> assumed power two years ago as the first elected civilian president after more than 30 years of military or military-dominated governments in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. His <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> ambassador, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON>, told the `` NewsHour'' program that the `` Central American family'' should initiate an effort to resolve the Panamanian crisis. Joining with <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> in any such effort would be the governments of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, all democracies with close links to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The administration has resisted significant involvement by other hemispheric governments in the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> issue, but has now shifted its strategy somewhat after calling a halt to its own initiative. While <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> indicated there would be a reduced <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> role in the future, he noted that the federal indictments against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> imply continued <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> participation in any effort to reach a settlement in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Although <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has little overt support in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, hemispheric nations have indicated deep reservations about the administration's approach to the problem. One example of this was a meeting of 26 Latin American countries two months ago at which a resolution was passed criticizing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Midnight was the switching hour for thousands of suburban <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> customers whose telephone service went up in flames on Mother's Day. At 11:59 p.m. Thursday, a technician punched a computer button at the fire-damaged <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION> switching station, hooking up half of <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>'s 35,000 Hinsdale-area customers to a new digital switching system. With that action, these customers should have normal service again, 2 -LCB- weeks after the May 8 fire at the switching station, a key part of the phone network for northern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bannon </PERSON> said Thursday. `` There might be some shakeout wrinkles, but these people should have state-of-the-art telephone service,'' including clearer lines and such options as call waiting and call forwarding previously unavailable through the 20-year-old equipment at the station, <PERSON> Bannon </PERSON> said. The new equipment, which normally takes 50 weeks to put into service, was installed in just two weeks by about 250 <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> employees working day and night, <PERSON> Bannon </PERSON> said. The rest of <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>'s Hinsdale-area customers will continue to have problems calling outside the area and getting long-distance service until they can be connected to the new equipment in early June, <PERSON> Bannon </PERSON> said. They remain hooked to the old equipment, which sustained smoke and fire damage but has been kept operational as a stopgap measure. `` The system is getting better, but it is upsetting,'' said <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Burr </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, whose phone line was one of those on the old equipment. `` You reach a point after a while where you are grateful for anything.'' The fire disrupted service for hundreds of thousands of residents in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s western suburbs and totally cut off the 35,000 customers for at least a week. <PERSON> Bannon </PERSON> said virtually all of the long-distance circuits and special business lines transmitting computer data that had been routed through the <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION> station had been restored, although it would still take a few more days to correct some scattered problems.

 Riot police fired volleys of tear gas and a special martial arts unit charged students today in the harshest response to a demonstration in 10 days of of anti-government protests. President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo earlier today ordered a crackdown on radical groups to safeguard the Olympic Games, which open in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> in September. Riot squads moved in quickly when radical students and dissidents attempted to march on City Hall. Police dispersed the protesters with tear gas and chased them through the streets. Radical students hurled a few firebombs and rocks at police but most ran when police charged. Police seized and dragged away dozens of protesters. Some of the protesters were repeatedly punched and kicked. `` Avenge the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> massacre!'' and `` Down with the military dictatorship!'' students screamed. They also shouted, `` Drive out the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>!'' The march was the latest to mark the anniversary of the 1980 civil uprising in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, during which about 200 people were killed. Students accuse <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> of complicity in the government's suppression of the 1980 protest About 7,000 riot police with shields, truncheons and tear gas rifles were deployed in the center of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Squads of riot police stood guard on street corners as columns of police swept through the street. The demonstrations also have been anti-American, with protesters charging that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supports military rule in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and that it forces the partition of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. Meanwhile, a radical student who set himself on fire died from severe burns, a student committee announced today. The committee said <PERSON> Choi </PERSON> <PERSON> Duk-soo </PERSON>, 20, a law student at <ORGANIZATION> Dankook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, will be be buried Monday in a `` Democratic People's Funeral'' at a still undetermined site <PERSON> Choi </PERSON> doused himself with a flammable liquid and set himself ablaze at a campus just south of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on May 18, the anniversary of the 1980 uprising. Classmates said <PERSON> Choi </PERSON> died Thursday at a <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> hospital and that the body was being kept in a student council building on the main <LOCATION> Dankook </LOCATION> campus in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. On May 15, another student stabbed himself and leaped from a building in a ritual suicide demanding the release of political prisoners and reunification of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. The death triggered a series of violent anti-government demonstrations. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said such protests imperil the security of the Olympic Games, which open in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> in September. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s call for a crackdown on such groups came during a meeting of top law-enforcement officials to review security in and around the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. `` It is imperative that all possible measures be taken to forestall acts of violence by domestic radical groups to guarantee the safety of the Olympics and their successful staging,'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> told the meeting. It was the first national security meeting <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> has called since he took office on Feb. 25. Among those attending the meeting were top military and police officials and several Cabinet ministers. Describing the coming months as `` the most dangerous'' since the Korean War in the early 1950's, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> warned that terrorist groups may stage attacks well before the Games open Sept. 17. The president expressed concern that <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> would try to sabotage the Olympics, but said attention should also be paid to `` left-leaning domestic radicals'' bent on violence.

 Fire broke out early today in the engine room of a British passenger ferry in the English Channel, but it was quickly put out and no one was hurt, officials said. The 3,335-ton European Trader, carrying 85 passengers and crew, was being towed to the French coast, according to its owners, P and <ORGANIZATION> O </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ferries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>. It maintained power, however, with an emergency generator. It was the second blaze this week aboard a British ferry plying the channel between <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and the Continent, the world's busiest waterway. On Monday, one crewman died and another was seriously burned when a fire started in the engine room of the 5,917-ton Seafreight Freeway, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Sealink </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.K. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>. The fire on the freight ferry was blamed on a fractured fuel pipe. Both fires occurred as the ferries sailed between this southeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> port and the Belgian port of <LOCATION> Zeebrugge </LOCATION>. It was outside <LOCATION> Zeebrugge </LOCATION> that the British ferry <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> capsized in March 1987, killing 193 people. P and O said the blaze in the engine room of the European Trader started before dawn today, 20 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Dunkirk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Crewmen evacuated the engine room as it filled with smoke. Helicopters flew out carrying firefighters and rescue workers, and tugs and a lifeboat were sent to the area. But the ship's captain reported that the fire was smothered by an on-board firefighting system activated when the crew evacuated the engine room There was no immediate indication what caused the blaze. The European Trader was the first vessel to break a continuing strike on P and O's lucrative Dover-Calais route when it sailed to the French port on May 14, the first such voyage for 15 weeks. Today, the ferry was carrying 44 passengers, 41 crewmen and 50 freight trucks from <LOCATION> Zeebrugge </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>, P and O said.

 Police today questioned a suspected <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> terrorist about the 1970 hijacking of a Japanese airliner to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, a police spokesman said. <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Shibata </PERSON>, 34, also will be questioned about whether the leftist terrorist group was planning any new terrorist action, the spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Shibata </PERSON>, 16 years old in 1970, was one of nine suspected <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> members who hijacked a <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 to the North Korean capital of <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>. He was arrested in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on May 6. Authorities said they brought <PERSON> Shibata </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today in an unusual helicopter airlift from his hometown in western <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to ensure his safety. He was taken to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, where questioning began. The Kobe Prosecutor's Office so far has charged him only with using someone else's passport. The police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said prosecutors will determine whether to charge him in the hijacking. The investigation also is looking into current <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> activity, he said. Two of the remaining seven hijackers declared in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> on Tuesday that they were ready to return to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` We ca n't leave him -LRB- <PERSON> Shibata </PERSON> -RRB- alone in his present situation,'' declared <PERSON> Moriaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakabayashi </PERSON>, 41, in his first interview with Japanese television. Police believe <PERSON> Shibata </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in April 1985 by an unknown route from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, and that another member of the hijacking team died in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> of illness. Police have said <PERSON> Shibata </PERSON> worked part time in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and obtained the phony passport in <LOCATION> Yokohama </LOCATION> in July 1986 using the name of a <LOCATION> Kobe </LOCATION> man with Japanese and North Korean citizenship. The man returned to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in 1972 without disclaiming his Japanese citizenship, they said. According to the <PERSON> Kobe </PERSON> <PERSON> Prosecutor </PERSON>'s Office, <PERSON> Shibata </PERSON> would face up to three years in prison if convicted of using a false passport. A convicted hijacker not charged with murder in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is subject to a maximum term of life in prison. Authorities said <PERSON> Shibata </PERSON> has refused to cooperate with police, but that travel records show he went several times to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> using the other man's passport. The police spokesman said today that it was too early to say whether <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> was being used as a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> base or whether <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> had aided the group in any way. Other police officials have said <PERSON> Shibata </PERSON> could not have left <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> without official government permission. <PERSON> Osamu </PERSON> <PERSON> Maruoka </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s reputed No. 2 man who was arrested in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> last November, and <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>, a suspected <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> member arrested in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in April for possessing explosives, are both believed to have traveled in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> before their arrests. Following <PERSON> Maruoka </PERSON>'s arrest, investigations showed he had reserved a one-way ticket to travel last Decemer to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, the site of the 1988 Summer Olympics. Two more suspected <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> members, <PERSON> Junzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Okudaira </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fusako </PERSON> <PERSON> Shigenobu </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s alleged leader, are being sought by police in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> for suspected involvement in a car bomb attack in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> in April. The arrests and bombing have sparked speculation that the long-dormant terrorist group is planning a comeback.

 Two faculty members accused of offering A's to students at <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Northridge </ORGANIZATION> campus in exchange for selling $ 100 in raffle tickets have been notified they will be fired, their attorney said University officials declined comment Thursday on the case against Pan-African studies Professor <PERSON> Eleazu </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Obinna </PERSON> and instructor <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON>. Obinna, a 17-year member of the department, and <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON>, a first-year instructor, were accused by students of offering A's in three African history and culture classes in exchange for selling raffle tickets, the university said last month. The raffle money went to <PERSON> Obinna </PERSON>'s nonprofit <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crusade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which he founded in 1982, the university said. The university April 28 canceled the three independent studies courses, with an enrollment of more than 180. Students had reported that the courses required no classroom attendance and assigned no course work. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, the faculty members' lawyer, said Thursday the letters alerted Obinna and <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON> of the university's intent to fire them. `` We intend to vigorously oppose any effort on the part of the university to dismiss either Dr. Obinna or Professor <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. The Nigerian-born Obinna, 54, denied any wrongdoing last month and said the charges were `` concocted by he administration.'' He said he required 45 hours of course work and graded students on participation in minority community affairs. <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON> has declined comment. The <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Attorney </LOCATION>'s office announced Tuesday it was conducting a separate investigation. <PERSON> Raffles </PERSON> are illegal under state law. In addition, the state attorney general's office is investigating whether donations to <PERSON> Obinna </PERSON>'s foundation were improperly diverted. City records show the foundation has spent $ 120 for the needy since its inception. Obinna and <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON> have seven days to request a hearing with an examiner. It then would be up to the university president to decide whether to uphold, modify or reject any discipline recommended by the examiner. The <LOCATION> Northridge </LOCATION> campus is 25 miles northwest of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of Syrian troops moved into <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s southern slums today to end a three-week bloodbath between rival Shiite Moslem militias. The Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, and the Syrian-armed Amal militia stopped shooting as the deployment began. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s move was expected to increase pressure for the release of 18 foreign hostages, including nine Americans, who are believed to be held in the slums by <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> factions linked to <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. Hours after <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> announced Thursday that its troops would move in, gunmen ambushed a car carrying four Syrian generals. All four escaped injury. About 900 soldiers wearing bulletproof vests over their combat fatigues advanced on foot from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s airport highway into the Ghobeiri and <LOCATION> Shiyah </LOCATION> districts. A half-hour earlier, shell blasts and staccato bursts of gunfire in the embattled slums resounded across <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Police had no word on what touched off the flareup, which occurred despite pledges by both factions to observe a cease-fire. The Syrians advanced in three groups, each made up of 300 infantrymen carrying machine guns and shoulder-fired grenade launchers. The first group was followed by 50 Lebanese policemen carrying automatic rifles. The Syrians set up four or five checkpoints along a disengagement line between the Amal-held Shiyah neighborhood and Hezbollah-controlled Ghobeiri. Wailing women greeted the Syrians as they moved in by showering them with rice in a traditional gesture of welcome. `` Animals, they're all animals, animals killing animals,'' a man standing in front of his bomb-shattered house shouted in English when he saw Western correspondents covering the Syrian advance. His house was seized by <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters during the final phase of the savage street fighting that erupted May 6. Police say 296 people have been killed and 1,000 wounded in the turf war. There was no immediate word when the Syrians planned to send tanks and other armor into the devastated districts to enforce the cease-fire. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s military intelligence chief in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ghazi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenaan </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> would deploy 7,500 soldiers in the 16-square-mile slums, about 90 percent of which are controlled by <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kenaan </PERSON> was one of four generals riding in a Mercedes 500 that was hit by dozens of bullets as it traveled through <PERSON> Ghobeiri </PERSON> on Thursday. Neither the generals nor their bodyguards were hurt, the Syrians reported. The attack came just hours after <PERSON> Kenaan </PERSON> announced Syrian forces would enter the slums today. Police said <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> militiamen raked <PERSON> Kenaan </PERSON>'s bulletproof dark blue Mercedes with machine gun fire as it drove through <PERSON> Ghobieri </PERSON>. According to police, <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> forces claimed they were not notified that <PERSON> Kenaan </PERSON>'s motorcade would be going through <PERSON> Ghobeiri </PERSON>, although police said notification was made. Also in the car were Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bairakdar </PERSON>, commander of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s forces in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>; Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammoud </PERSON>, chief of military intelligence for the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> area; and Brig Gen. <PERSON> Zuheir </PERSON> <PERSON> Musattat </PERSON>. President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>'s Syrian government announced on Thursday that a truce agreement has been reached with all parties concerned, including <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, to end the carnage. `` Ending the fighting will create new hope for the hostages and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> will spare no effort to secure their release, regardless of their nationality,'' a <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> official told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>. A source at the Syrian command, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the deployment operation would be carried out in two stages today and Saturday. The first involves the establishment of buffer zones in key positions along the confrontation lines in the neighborhoods of <LOCATION> Shiyah </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ghobeiri </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mesharrafieh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Haret </PERSON> <PERSON> Hreik </PERSON> today, he said. The deployment in the rest of the slums would be completed on Saturday, including <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s main strongholds of Bir el-Abed and <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> <PERSON> Madi </PERSON>, the source added. The hostages are believed to be imprisoned in <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s Hay Madi barracks. Both Amal and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> have said they would withdraw their fighters once the <ORGANIZATION> Syrians </ORGANIZATION> move in and keep only political and information offices. It was not clear whether the hostages were part of the truce deal. But the Iranian assistant foreign minister, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Besharati </PERSON>, predicted last week that the hostage problem would be solved after peace was restored in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, embroiled in civil war for 13 years. Although an ally of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, it appears anxious that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s brand of Islamic fundamentalism may be getting too much of a foothold in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s pro-Vietnamese government urged the world today to respond to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s troop pullout by taking steps to prevent the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> from returning to power in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> said Thursday it would withdraw its 50,000 troops, or what it said was half its force in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, between June and December as part of its plan of a complete pullout by 1990. The remaining troops are to be placed under the command of the pro-Vietnamese government, it said. A statement issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Cambodian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said today that attempts to help the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> return to power created a `` very dangerous obstacle'' to holding peace talks with the three Cambodian guerrilla groups that oppose <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s occupation. The Chinese-backed <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> is the largest and most powerful of these groups. `` It is imperative to absolutely eliminate this obstacle at a time when more than half the Vietnamese volunteer troops have already been withdrawn from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>,'' said the statement, which was carried by the official Cambodian radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. It said the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> must be tried by the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and also denied the use of sanctuaries in foreign territory. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978 after a series of bloody border clashes with the communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> government, which killed millions of people during its nearly four-year rule. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> installed a pro-Hanoi government. The radio of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> dismissed <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s statement as propaganda and said it has never seen a single Vietnamese soldier leave <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. It urged the world to continue pressuring <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> to withdraw all its forces unconditionally as demanded in annual <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> resolutions. The Cambodian government statement also said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s decision to pull its troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> 18 miles back from the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border showed neighborly intentions that <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> should match. Vietnamese and Thai forces frequently have clashed along the border. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s decision to pull out of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> resulted from <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Prem </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinsulanonda </PERSON>'s talks last week with leaders in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and its allies in the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> are trying to arrange informal talks in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> among the warring Cambodian factions, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and other concerned countries. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanoi </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday the guerrillas and their backers should agree to a political settlement because `` the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> issue will no longer exist after 1990,'' when the last troops leave. The pro-Vietnamese government increasingly is able to control the country by itself, said a text of the broadcast obtained today. It said the key issue is to guarantee that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> does n't return and that this is the responsibility of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s withdrawal would be by far the largest of annual pullouts <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> claims to have made since 1982. The previous withdrawals had already reduced by half the force that was originally in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> says.

 Police Commissioner <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, who won wide praise for turning around a department reeling from corruption and the MOVE disaster, says he is resigning after 2 -LCB- years to spend more time with his family, `` Commissioner <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> has brought integrity and pride to a department in crisis,'' Mayor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> said Thursday in accepting the resignation. `` He has left his significant mark of professionalism.'' When <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, 48, a former <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent who spent two decades guarding government figures, took over the 6,700-member force in 1986, morale was poor and the department was held in low esteem. It was just seven months after the May 1985 confrontation with the radical group MOVE in which police dropped a bomb that set fire to a neighborhood. Eleven people in the MOVE house died and 61 homes were destroyed. Morale also was suffering from the convictions of 34 officers, including a deputy commissioner, accused of taking bribes from vice figures. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, the first outsider in more than 60 years to head the department, took the post saying he would stay two to three years. `` It was a high honor and privilege to serve the city,'' <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said Thursday. `` Our department has made progress. We have moved forward together. It has been a team effort with the officers, the city and the public.'' <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said he wants to spend more time with his wife and two children, who live in nearby <LOCATION> Medford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. He said the city's residency requirements and the demands of the job allowed little time with his family He has been occupying a downtown apartment because of a law requiring city residence for all employees. `` It personally took its toll,'' he said. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> denied speculation that a budget shortfall for fiscal 1989 which might result in police layoffs played any role in his resignation, which is effective June 10. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> has taken a job with a bank in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. The mayor said he would appoint a successor from within the department. Among the leading candidates are the two deputy commissioners, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> and <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. If appointed, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> would be <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s first black police commissioner. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, who was a police officer in <LOCATION> Rahway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, before joining the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in 1965, spent four years providing security for President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON>, and her two children. He was agent in charge of the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> office before resigning in 1985 for a job in private business.

The executives said the 18-member crew of the 18,000-ton <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> abandoned ship after the 8 a.m. attack. An Omani warship sailing nearby rescued them. The executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the crew, all <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION>, were transferred to a salvage tugboat of the Dutch company <PERSON> Smit </PERSON> and appeared to have been unharmed. <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> photographer <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> English </PERSON>, who was aboard a helicopter in the area, said a second <PERSON> Smit </PERSON> salvage tugboat was battling the flames as they ravaged the freighter's stern. The executives said the Iranians fired at the helicopter chartered by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> when it tried to get close to the site of the attack. But they said the four volleys of gunfire only hit the water and did not damage the aircraft. It was the second Iranian raid in 12 hours and the fourth in 10 days. On May 3 <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> broadened the duties of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in the gulf, allowing <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> warships to intervene in attacks on commercial ships, even if they are not sailing under the Stars and Stripes. The executives said no American warships were believed to have been in the vicinity of the <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> when it was raided. All the recent Iranian attacks took place near the Iranian offshore <LOCATION> Larak </LOCATION> oil terminal and all the ships were sailing to or from Saudi Arabian ports. Iraqi jets raided <PERSON> Larak </PERSON> on May 14, hitting five tankers, including the world's largest, the Seawise Giant. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> strikes <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s oil facilities to pressure <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> into ending its 7 -LCB- - year-old war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> retaliates by attacking neutral commercial shipping. In the land battle, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio late Thursday quoted a statement by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guards </ORGANIZATION> saying that in the fighting east of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, `` severe casualties were inflicted on the enemy and more than 10,000 of them were killed or wounded.'' It was the first time either side has reported any casualty figures in this week's fighting, centered in the area between <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, a southern Iraqi city, and the Iranian border town of <LOCATION> Shalamcheh </LOCATION>. Western military analysts say an estimated 35,000 to 40,000 Iraqi troops took part in the operation, retaking chunks of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> territory in the third military defeat for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> since mid-May. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio, monitored by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said Iranian forces were continuing to resist the Iraqis from new positions. Earlier the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, admitted that Iranian forces `` had to retreat from parts of the area they had captured earlier.'' It said the Iranians were now in `` new positions'' but gave no details, in one of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s rare acknowledgements that it had suffered a military setback. The radio also reported `` large numbers'' of volunteers were dispatched to the front from 19 cities across <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the 24 hours following the Iraqi offensive. On April 18, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> recaptured its <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, which had been occupied by Iranian forces since early 1986. On the same day, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces destroyed two Iranian oil platforms and sank or damaged six Iranian warships in the gulf.

 A former South African opposition leader met today with leaders of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group for what he called informal discussions. <PERSON> Frederik </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Zyl </PERSON> <PERSON> Slabbert </PERSON>, former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and an apartheid opponent, met with four <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> national executive committee members, including information and publicity head <PERSON> Thabo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON>. The same four met Thursday with an eight-member delegation from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is the major guerrilla group fighting the white-minority government in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Outlawed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, it is based in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>. After Thursday's meeting, the two sides said they sharply disagreed about the use of violence to bring about reforms in their homeland. <PERSON> Slabbert </PERSON> spoke briefly to reporters during a break in his discussions with <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> officials at a <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> hotel. `` It's an informal discussion on a wide range of topics,'' <PERSON> Slabbert </PERSON> said. `` We're just a group of concerned South Africans talking.'' <PERSON> Slabbert </PERSON> said that in the talks he had not tried to persuade the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> to `` change strategies'' and try to become involved in local and national politics. The South African government has refused to lift its ban on the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> unless it renounces violence. <PERSON> Slabbert </PERSON> is director of planning and policy for the Institute for a Democratic Alternative for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, an anti-apartheid think tank he helped found. He is widely viewed as his country's most charismatic white anti-apartheid leader Five members from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> delegation attended today's meeting, said <PERSON> Harald </PERSON> <PERSON> Pakendorf </PERSON>, a member of the delegation. <PERSON> Wynand </PERSON> <PERSON> Malan </PERSON>, leader of the delegation and a parliamentary member, was asked after the Thursday meeting if the two anti-apartheid groups had discussed the use of violence. `` We voiced not only our position but our difference over that strategy,'' <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> told reporters. `` We also got an explanation from -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- again as to the origin of the armed struggle. We can understand from their perspective exactly what they are saying, but from our position we are still fundamentally in disagreement to it,'' <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> said. He said he wants to continue talks with the banned group to resolve differences. In a joint statement, the two groups said: `` Common ground was found in relation to the kind of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> we would like to see.'' `` However, there were important differences with respect to some aspects of the strategy through which this could be achieved,'' the statement continued. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Faculty of 14 Resigns When Told Jewish Teachers Must Be Faithful
to Christ</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 All 13 teachers at a church-run nursery school have resigned after its governing board announced that all faculty members, <PERSON> Christians </PERSON> and Jews alike, must profess faith in Jesus Christ or quit. Five teachers and about half of the 82 toddlers at the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sherman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oaks </ORGANIZATION> are Jewish, school director <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cummings </PERSON> said. A 23-year school employee, Ms. <PERSON> Cummings </PERSON> also turned in her resignation Thursday. `` I am a Presbyterian, but I can not conduct a school where I have to explain to children that their teacher has been fired because she is Jewish,'' she said. `` I do not believe in what they are doing.'' The governing board of the church voted Tuesday to change the school from a non-religious nursery school to a ministry of the church that teaches Christian principles, said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, clerk of the church's 21-member board. As part of that plan, all teachers working by September 1989 must `` profess the Christian faith as a condition of employment,'' he said. `` Those who teach Christian teaching should subscribe to those teachings themselves,'' the Revs. <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, pastors of the church, said in a statement. `` Christian teaching is not simply an academic matter but a matter of an entire world view.'' Some of the Jewish teachers accused the church of anti-Semitism. `` We were devastated,'' said <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Freitag </PERSON>, who has taught at the school for 14 years. `` I take it as a personal assault. They're saying they do n't want the Jewish influence. The Powells denied the church was being anti-Semitic. `` The school will continue to be open to children of all races. We are only trying to reorganize the teachings of the school,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. Jewish teachers could remain if they are `` confessing Christians,'' he said. Officials of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith, a Jewish civil rights organization, said the policy appeared to be legal. Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmos </PERSON> of the employment commission said hiring practices by religious institutions were exempted from the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The resignations are effective June 15, the end of the academic year. Actress <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Klous </PERSON> of television's `` Love Boat,'' singer <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> and former astronaut <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> are among parents whose children either attend or attended the school. Ms. <PERSON> Klous </PERSON>, who is not Jewish, said she would withdraw her child. `` I'm heartbroken,'' she said. `` I ca n't see supporting a school where I do n't believe in what they do,'' said <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, whose wife is a volunteer substitute.

 Baton-wielding riot police today arrested 245 black employees of a luxury hotel as they demonstrated against a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company that is canceling its contract to manage the hotel. The <ORGANIZATION> Westin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> had managed the <ORGANIZATION> Carlton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> for 15 years. It reportedly decided to pull out of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> because of pressure from the anti-apartheid movement. Hotel guests, including a contingent of travel agents from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, looked on in amazement as police ordered the chanting protesters to disperse, then moved in with batons to begin the arrests. Police, who have authority to declare virtually any outdoor gathering illegal, said 142 men and 103 women were arrested. The workers were released several hours later after the hotel management paid $ 50 fines for each worker. Payment of the fines acknowledges guilt for the gathering. During the first arrests, some protesters were beaten and flung into police vans. Other employees _ including cooks in chef's hats and a doorman in top hat and tails _ voluntarily moved toward the vehicles to be taken to police headquarters. <PERSON> Westin </PERSON> announced last month that it would withdraw on June 6 as manager of the Carlton. Workers carried signs accusing <PERSON> Westin </PERSON> of exploitation and told reporters that the firm should pay them severance bonuses as part of its disinvestment. The <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON>, one of the two luxury hotels in central <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, is owned by the property division of <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s largest conglomerate. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Macartney </PERSON>, the hotel's marketing director, He said the workers' contracts were with the hotel owners, not with <PERSON> Westin </PERSON>, and were not affected by the disinvestment. He said the management wanted to meet with the workers to explain the situation and hear complaints. Before the confrontation with police, the protesters _ including maids, bellhops and waiters _ trotted around the block on which the <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> and an adjoining high-rise office building stand. Inside the hotel, white employees served breakfast in the restaurant and made beds, while departing guests carried their own luggage. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs.

<TEXT>
 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speech at <LOCATION> Finlandia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> on Friday: Thank you Thank you all very much. Mr. President, Mr. <PERSON> Speaker </PERSON>, Mr. Prime Minister, and ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by saying thank you to our hosts, the Finnish government, the <ORGANIZATION> Paasikivi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and the League of Finnish-American Societies. It's a particular honor for me to come here today. This year, the year of friendship, as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has proclaimed it, between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>; this year marks the 350th anniversary of the arrival of the first Finns in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the establishment of a small Scandinavian colony near what is today <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> _ an ancient people in a new world. And that is the story not only of those Finns, but of all the peoples who braved the seas to settle in and build my country, a land of freedom for a nation of immigrants. Yes, they founded a new world. But as they crossed the oceans, the mountains and the prairies, those who made <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> carried the old world in their hearts _ the old customs, the family ties, and most of all, the belief in God, a belief that gave them the moral compass and ethical foundation by which they explored an uncharted frontier and constructed a government and nation of, by and for the people. And so although we Americans became a new people, we also remain an ancient one, for we're guided by ancient and universal values, values that Prime Minister <PERSON> Holkeri </PERSON> spoke of in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> this February, when, after recalling <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>'s internationally recognized position of neutrality, he added that <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> is tied to Western values of freedom, democracy and human rights. And let me add here that for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, those ties are also the bonds of our friendship. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> respects <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>'s neutrality. We support <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>'s independence We honor <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>'s courageous history. We value the creative statesmanship that has been <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>'s gift to world peace. And in this soaring hall, which is the great architect <PERSON> Alvar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alto </PERSON>'s statement of hope for <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>'s future, we reaffirm our hope and faith that the friendship between our nations will be unending We are gathered here today in this hall, because it was here, almost thirteen years ago, that the 35 nations of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> signed the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Final Act, a document that embodies the same ethical and moral principles and the same hope for a future of peace that Finns and so many other European immigrants gave <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The Final Act is a singular statement of hope. Its three baskets touch on almost every aspect of East-West relations and taken together form a kind of map through the wilderness of mutual hostility to open fields of peace and to a common home of trust among all of our sovereign nations, neutrals, nonaligned and Alliance members alike. The Final Act sets new standards of conduct for our nations and provided the mechanisms by which to apply those standards. Yes, the Final Act goes beyond arms control, once the focus of international dialogue. It reflects a truth that I have so often noted: nations do not distrust each other because they are armed; they are armed because they distrust each other. The Final Act grapples with the full range of our underlying differences and deals with East-West relations as an interrelated whole. It reflects the belief of all our countries that human rights are less likely to be abused when a nation's security is less in doubt, that economic relations can contribute to security, but depend on the trust and confidence that come from increasing ties between our peoples, increasing openness and increasing freedom, and that there is no true international security without respect for human rights. I can hardly improve on the words that President <PERSON> Koivisto </PERSON> used in this hall two years ago when he recalled that security is more than the protection of borders and social structures. It is emphasized in the Final Act that individual persons who live in the participating states have to feel in their own lives security which is based on respect for fundamental human rights and basic freedoms. And beyond establishing these integrated standards, the Final Act establishes a process for progress. It sets up a review procedure to measure performance against standards and despite the doubts of the critics, for the past 13 years, the signatory states have mustered the political will to keep on working and making progress. Let me say that it adds _ well, it seems particularly appropriate to me that the Final Act is associated so closely with this city and this country. More than any other diplomatic document, the Final Act speaks to the yearning that <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>'s long-time President, <PERSON> Urno </PERSON> <PERSON> Kekkonen </PERSON>, spoke of more than a quarter century ago when he said in his words, `` It's the fervent hope of the Finnish people that barriers be lowered all over <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and that progress be made along the road of <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> unity.'' And he added that this was, as he put it, `` for the good of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and thus of humanity as a whole.'' Well, those were visionary words. That vision inspired and shaped the drafting of the Final Act and continues to guide us today. Has the Final Act and what we call `` the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> process'' worked or not? Many say it has n't, but I believe it has. In the security field, I would point to the most recent fruit of the process, the Stockholm document of Confidence and Security-Building Measures in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. This agreement lays down the rules by which our 35 states notify each other of upcoming military activities in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, provides detailed information on these activities in advance and lets the others know their plans for very large military activities one or two years in advance and agrees not to hold such maneuvers unless this notice is given, invites observers to their larger military activities and permits on-site inspections to make sure the agreement is honored. I'm happy to note that since our representatives shook hands to seal this agreement a year and a half ago, all 35 states have, by and large, honored both the letter and the spirit of the Stockholm document. The Western and neutral and non-aligned states have set strong example in providing full information about their military activities. In April, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> held its first military activity subject to the <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> notification requirements and voluntarily invited observers to it. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its allies also have a generally good record of implementation, though less forthcoming than the West. Ten on-site inspections have been conducted so far, and more and more states are exercising their right to make such inspections. I ca n't help but believe that making inspections a matter of routine business would improve openness and enhance confidence.

<HEAD>Sikhs Kill Nine, Government Plans to Raze Houses Around Golden
Temple</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sikh extremists killed nine people in the northern state of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> today. The government said it would cut a 100-yard buffer zone around the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> to keep militants out of <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION>'s holiest shrine. On Thursday, President <PERSON> Ramaswami </PERSON> <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON> issued an ordinance making it illegal for temples and other religious sites to be used for political purposes. It also would make harboring a wanted criminal in a shrine punishable by imprisonment or a fine. Home Minister <PERSON> Buta </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, whose ministry is responsible for internal security, said today the government would clear houses and shops from around the Golden Temple complex in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. The actions were aimed at stemming the rising violence by <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> extremists, who have been waging a guerrilla war in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> since 1982 for more political autonomy or an independent homeland. The Sikhs, whose religion was formed about 500 years ago as an alternative to <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> and Islam, say they are discriminated against by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s majority Hindus. The latest killings raised to more than 1,180 the number of deaths blamed on <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> extremists in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> since the start of the year. In all of 1987, 1,030 people died. The decision to cut a corridor around the walled shrine follows a 10-day siege by police and paramilitary troops to drive Sikh radicals from the temple. The siege ended May 18 with the surrender of the last of 200 Sikh extremists and sympathizers from the complex. At least 46 people were killed in the confrontation, most of them militants. The police continue to keep a cordon around the shrine, but their security efforts are hampered because dozens of shops, houses and narrow alleys beside the complex provide cover for militants moving around in the area. <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chidambaram </PERSON>, <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s deputy, told the news conference that about 700 families and 300 shops would be displaced. He said the government would set up a resettlement program for those forced to move.

In the economic field, as in the security field, I believe there has been progress, but of a different kind. Issues and negotiations regarding security are not simple, but military technology makes arms and armies resemble each other enough so that common measures can be confidently applied. Economic relations, by contrast, are bedeviled by differences in our systems. Perhaps increases in non-strategic trade can contribute to better relations between East and West. But it's difficult to relate the state-run economies of the East to the essentially free market economies of the West. Perhaps some of the changes underway in the state-run economies will equip them better to deal with our businessmen and open new arenas for cooperation. But our work on these issues over the years has already made us understand that differences in systems are serious obstacles to expansion of economic ties, and since understanding of unpleasant realities is part of wisdom, that, too, is part of progress. The changes taking place in the Eastern countries of the continent go beyond changes in their economic systems and greater openness in their military activities. Changes have also begun to occur in the field of human rights as was called for in the Final Act. The rest of us would like to see the changes that are being announced actually registered in the law and practice of our Eastern partners, and in the documents under negotiation in the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> follow-up to the <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. Much has been said about the human rights and humanitarian provisions in the Final Act, and the failure of the Eastern bloc to honor them. Yet, for all the bleak winds that have swept the plains of justice since that signing day in 1975, the Accords have taken root in the conscience of humanity, and grown in moral and, increasingly, in diplomatic authority. I believe that this is no accident. It reflects an increasing realization that the agenda of East-West relations must be comprehensive, that security and human rights must be advanced together, or can not truly be secured at all. But it also shows that the provisions in the Final Act reflect standards that are truly universal in their scope. The Accords embody a fundamental truth, a truth that gathers strength with each passing season, and that will not be denied; a truth, that like the first Finnish settlers in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, all our ancient peoples find themselves today in a new world, and that, as those early settlers discovered, the greatest creative and moral force in this new world, the greatest hope for survival and success, for peace and happiness, is human freedom. Yes, freedom, the right to speak, to print, the right to worship, to travel, to assemble, the belief, the right to be different, the right as the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> philospher <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Thoreau </PERSON> wrote, `` to step to the music of a different drummer.'' This is freedom as most Europeans and Americans understand it, and freedom as it is embodied in the universal Declaration of Human Rights, and, yes, in the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Accords. And far more than the locomotive or the automobile, the airplane or the rocket, more than radio, television, or the computer, this concept of liberty is the most distinct, peculiar, and powerful invention of the civilization we all share. Indeed, without this freedom there would have been no mechanical inventions, for inventions are eccentricities, the men and women who create them are visionaries, just like artists and writers, they see what others fail to see and trust their insights when others do n't. The same freedom that permits literature and the arts to flourish, the same freedom that allows one to attend church, synagogue, or mosque without apprehension, that same freedom from oppression and supervision is the freedom that has given us, the peoples of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, our dynamism, our economic growth, and out inventiveness. Together with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and many others, we have lived in this state of freedom, this house of democracy, since the end of the Second World War. A house of democracy is a house whose doors are open to all. Because of it, because of the liberty and popular rule we've shared, today we also share a prosperity more widely distributed and extensive, a political order more tolerant and humane than has ever before been known on earth. To see not simply the immediate, but the historic importance of this, we should remember how far many of our nations have traveled and how desolate the future of freedom and democracy once seemed. Much of this century, the totalitarian temptation in one form or another has beckoned to mankind, also promising freedom, but of a different kind than the one that we celebrate today. This concept of liberty is, as the Czechoslovak writer <PERSON> Milan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kundera </PERSON> has put it, `` The age-old dream of a world where everybody would live in harmony, united by a single common will and faith, without secrets from one another, the freedom of imposed perfection.'' Fifty, forty, even as recently as thirty years ago, the contest between this utopian concept of freedom on one hand and the democratic concept of freedom on the other seemed a close one. Promises of a perfect world lured many Western thinkers and millions of others besides. And many believed in the confident prediction of history's inevitable triump. Well, few do today. Just as democratic freedom has proven itself incredibly fertile, fertile not merely in a material sense, but also in the abundance it has brought forth in the human spirit. So too, Utopianism has proven brutal and barren. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Camus </PERSON> once predicted that, in his words, `` When revolution in the name of power and of history becomes a murderous and immoderate mechanism, a new rebellion is consecrated in the name of moderation of life.'' Is n't this exactly what we see happening across the mountains and plains of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and even beyond the Urals today? In <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, support for Utopian ideologies, including support among intellectuals, has all but collapsed. While in the non-democratic countries, leaders grapple with the internal contradictions of their system. And some ask how they can make that system better and more productive. In a sense, the front line in the competition of ideas that has played in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> for more than 70 years has shifted East. Once, it was the democracies that doubted their own view of freedom and wondered whether utopian systems might not be better. Today, the doubt is on the other side. In just two days, I will meet in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with General Secretary <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. It'll be our fourth set of face-to-face talks since 1985. The General Secretary and I have developed a broad agenda for US-Soviet relations, an agenda that is linked directly to the agenda of the Final Act. Yes, as does the Final Act, we will discuss security issues, we will pursue progress in arms reduction and negotiations across the board, and continue our exchanges on regional issues.

 Seven tugboats this morning began hauling a drilling platform to its home off the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> coast where, when erected, it will stand higher than the world's tallest building. `` It looks smaller and smaller the farther away it gets,'' <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, installation superintendent for the unwieldy engineering marvel, said as the launch got under way. `` My job's just beginning.'' The world's tallest offshore drilling platform, dubbed Bullwinkle, weighs 50,000 tons and is 1,365 feet long. After its two drilling rigs are installed in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, it will weigh 78,000 tons and stand 1,615 feet high _ 161 feet higher than the world's tallest building, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s Sears Tower. `` It is kind of a letdown when you finally see it go out,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON>, project manager for <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Offshore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday while overseeing last-minute preparations. Sterling has been in charge of Bullwinkle during the three years it has taken to build the platform. Shell estimates the total cost of the Bullwinkle project at $ 500 million. Half of that is for building and installing the platform and preparing it for drilling, while the remainder will go toward development drilling, permanent production facilities and a pipeline to move the oil to shore, the company said. A steady stream of area residents stopped by the yard Thursday night to take a final look at the huge drilling jacket, which towers above the platform's 4 -LCB- - acre base and is visible several miles away in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION> The jacket will hold the drilling rigs. `` I came out to see it one last time,'' said <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Waddle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, as Bullwinkle loomed in front of him. Workers expect to take about three days to pull the structure about 380 miles to its destination, some 150 miles southwest of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Installation will be completed in about three months. Twenty-eight pilings for Bullwinkle will be driven 400 feet into the sea floor and secured with concrete. Bullwinkle is designed to withstand at least a 72-foot hurricane wave, with the ability to sway at least six feet without stress damage. <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> estimates that production will begin in the first quarter of 1989, and will peak at 50,000 barrels of oil a day in 1991 and 90 million cubic feet of natural gas a day in 1992. It has an estimated life span of 35 years, according to the company. The Bullwinkle project was conceived when oil fetched well above $ 20 a barrel, <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON> said. But, he added, `` even today at $ 15 it's an economic -LRB- profitable -RRB- venture.''

<HEAD>HELSINKI: regional issues.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Yes, we will also discuss economic issues, although, as in the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> process, we have seen in recent years how much the differences in our systems inhibit expanded ties and how difficult it is to divorce economic relations from human rights and other elements of that relationship. And, yes, as our countries did at <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, we will take up other bilateral areas as well, including scientific, cultural, and people-to-people exchanges, where we've been hard at work identifying new ways to cooperate. In this area in particular, I believe we'll see some good results before the week is over. And like the Final Act, our agenda now includes human rights as an integral component. We have developed our dialogue and put in place new mechanisms for discussion. The General Secretary has spoken and forthrightly on the problems confronting the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In his campaign to address these shortcomings, he talks of glasnost and perestroika, openness and restructuring, words that to our ears have a particularly welcome sound. And since he began his campaign, things have happened that all of us applaud. The list includes the release from labor camps or exile of people like <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Irina </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratushnaskaya </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Koryagin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Iosef </PERSON> <PERSON> Begun </PERSON>, and many other prisoners of conscience; the publication of books like `` Dr. Zhivago'' and `` Children of the Arbat''; the distribution of movies like `` Repentance'' that are critical of aspects of the Soviet past and present; allowing higher levels of emigration; greater toleration of dissent; General Secretary <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s recent statements on religious toleration; the beginning of Soviet withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. All this is new and good. But at the same time, there is another list, defined not by us, but by the standards of the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Final Act and the sovereign choice of all participants, including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, to subscribe to it. We need look no further through the Final Act to see where Soviet practice does not, or does not yet, measure up to Soviet commitment. Thirteen years after the Final Act was signed, it's difficult to understand why cases of divided families and blocked marriages should remain on the <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> agenda, or why Soviet citizens who wish to exercise their right to emigrate should be subject to artificial quotas and arbitrary rulings. And what are we to think of the continued suppression of those who wish to practice their religious beliefs? Over 300 men and women whom the world sees as political prisoners have been released. There remains no reason why the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> can not release all people still in jail for expression of political or religious belief, or for organizing to monitor the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Act. The Soviets talk about a common European home, and define it largely in terms of geography. But what is it that cements the structure of clear purpose, that all our nations pledge themselves to build by their signature of the Final Act? What is it but the belief in alienable rights and dignity of every single human being? What is it but a commitment to true pluralist democracy? What is it but a dedication to the universally understood democratic concept of liberty that evolved from the genius of European civilization? This body of values, this is what marks, or should mark, the common European home. Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has spoken of, in his words, `` the artificiality and temporariness of the block-to-block confrontation and the archaic nature of the Iron Curtain.'' Well, I join him in this belief, and welcome every sign that the Soviets and their allies are ready not only to embrace, but to put into practice, the values that unify and indeed define contemporary Western European civilization and its grateful American offspring. Some 30 years ago, another period of relative openness, the Italian socialist <PERSON> Pietro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nenni </PERSON>, long a friend of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, warned that it was wrong to think that the relaxation could be permanent in, as he said, `` the absence of any system of judicial guarantees.'' And he added that only democracy and liberty could prevent reversal of the progress under way. There are a number of steps which, if taken, would help ensure the deepening and institutionalization of promise and reforms. First, the Soviet leaders could agree to tear down the Berlin Wall and all barriers between Eastern and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. They could join us in making <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> itself an all-European center of communications, meetings and travel. They could also give legal and practical protection to free expression and worship. Let me interject here that at one time <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was known as the city of the `` forty-forties,'' because there were 1,600 belfries in the churches of the city. The world welcomed the return of some churches to worship after many years, but there are still relatively few functioning churches, and almost no bells. Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> recently said, as he put it, `` believers are <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people, workers, patriots, and they have the full right to express their conviction with dignity.'' While I applaud Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s statement, but a magnificent demonstration of good will it would be for the Soviet leadership for church bells to ring out again, not only in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, but throughout the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But beyond these particular steps there is a deeper question: How can the countries of the East not only grant but guarantee the protection of rights? The thought and practice of centuries has pointed out the way, as the French constitutional philosopher <LOCATION> Montesquieu </LOCATION> wrote more than two hundred years ago, `` There is no liberty if the judiciary power be not separated from the other powers of government.'' And, like the independence of the judiciary, popular control over those who make the laws provides a vital, practical guarantee of human rights. So does the secret ballot. So the freedom of citizens to associate and act for political purposes or for free collective bargaining. I know that for the Eastern countries such steps are difficult, and some may say it's unrealistic to call for them. Some said in 1975 that the standards set forth in the Final Act were unrealistic, that the comprehensive agenda it embodied was unrealistic. Some said earlier in this decade that calling for global elimination of an entire class of <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles was unrealistic, but calling for 50 percent reductions in <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> and Soviet strategic offensive arms was unrealistic, that the Soviets would never withdraw from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Well, is it realistic to pretend that rights are truly protected when there are no effective safeguards against arbitrary rule? Is it realistic when the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leadership itself is calling for glasnost and democratization to say that judicial guarantees, or the independence of the judiciary, or popular control over those who draft the laws, or freedom to associate for political purposes are unrealistic? And finally, is it realisitic to say that peace is truly secure when political systems are less than open?

 We believe that realism is on our side when we say that peace and freedom can only be achieved together, but that they can indeed be achieved together if we're prepared to drive toward that goal. So did the leaders who met in this room to sign the Final Act. They were visionaries of the most practical kind. In shaping our policy toward the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, in preparing for my meetings with the General Secretary, I have taken their vision, a shared vision subscribed to by East, West, and the proud neutral and non-aligned countries of this continent, as my guide. I believe the standard that the framers of the Final Act set, including the concept of liberty it embodies, is a standard for all of us. We can do no less than uphold it and try to see it turned, as the Soviets say, into life itself. We, in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, will remain firm in our values, strong and vigilent in defense of our interests, ready to negotiate honestly for results of mutual and universal benefit. One lesson we drew again from the events leading up to the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty was that in the world as it is today, peace truly does depend on Western strength and resolve. It is a lesson we will continue to heed. But we're also prepared to work with the Soviets and their allies whenever they're ready to work with us. By strength we do not mean a diktat _ that is an imposed settlement. We mean confident negotiation. The road ahead may be long, but not as long as our countries had before them 44 years ago when <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>'s great president <PERSON> J.K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paasikivi </PERSON> told a nation that had shown the world uncommon courage in a harrowing time, `` A path rises up from the slope from the floor of the valley. At times the ascent is gradual, at other times it's steeper. But all the time one comes closer and closer to free open spaces above which God's ever brighter sky can be seen. The way up will be difficult, but every step will take us closer to open vistas.'' I believe that in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and I can take another step toward a brighter future and a safer world. And I believe that for the sake of all our ancient peoples, this new world must be a place both of democratic freedom and of peace. It must be a world in which the spirit of the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Final Act guides all our countries, like a great beacon of hope to all mankind for ages to come. Thank you, and <PERSON> God </PERSON> bless you, and bear with me now: Hyvaa menestysta Svomen kansalle -LRB- Good luck to the Finnish nation. -RRB-

 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers fired tear gas grenades at <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> protesters in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> today, and a 3-year-old girl who inhaled the gas died, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. The army command confirmed the child's death but said the cause could not exactly be determined. Also today, two <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> teen-agers shot by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers during clashes in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> died, hospital officials and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. The deaths bring to 198 the number of Palestinians killed since the Arab uprising in the occupied territories began last Dec. 8. Two Israelis also have died. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, hundreds o Moslem worshipers waving outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags and black flags of mourning marched from a mosque to the home of <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, the cousin of the slain <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> military chief <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, an Arab reporter said. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader, better known as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON>, was assassinated last month in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, reportedly by Israeli commandos. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers blocked Palestinians from attending a ceremony at the cousin's home Wednesday. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported demonstrations in the Jabaliya refugee camp and the towns of <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. On Thursday, an Arab assailant stabbed a Jewish teen-ager in the back as he walked through the Moslem quarter of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Mayor <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> called the attack on the seminary student an isolated incident, but he said the nearly 6-month-long Palestinian uprising has raised tensions between the city's Arabs and Jews. In the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, thousands of Moslem worshipers dispersed peacefully after Sabbath prayers today. Officials at <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ahli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> hospital said relatives brought <PERSON> Dina </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawafiri </PERSON>, claiming she died of tear gas fired by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops in the <LOCATION> Zaytoona </LOCATION> neighborhood. Hospital officials said the girl's 24-year-old aunt, <PERSON> Sabbah </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawafiri </PERSON>, also was treated for tear gas effects. A relative who spoke on condition of anonymity said a tear gas grenade landed in front of the family's house. A doctor at the hospital said the causes of <PERSON> Dina </PERSON>'s death could not be determined because the family took the girl's body and buried it. The army command confirmed the report. A 14-year-old youth died at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hadassah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> of a wound to his head suffered Wednesday during a protest in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> refugee camp of <LOCATION> Jalazone </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The radio said the boy apparently was shot accidentally when he peeked out of his house. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports identified him as <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rajab </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Radaha </PERSON>. <PERSON> Iyad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaid </PERSON>, 16, died at east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Makassed </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> of bullet wounds to his chest and back. He was wounded early in February during a demonstration in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Qalqiliya </LOCATION>, hospital officials said. <PERSON> Chanoch </PERSON> <PERSON> Albeck </PERSON>, 16, suffered a punctured lung when he was attacked Thursday as he walked through the city's perfume market. Police said the assailant shouted `` God is great'' before plunging a kitchen knife into <PERSON> Albeck </PERSON>'s back. <PERSON> Albeck </PERSON> was in stable condition today. Police rounded up 27 suspects. It was the second attack on a Jewish civilian in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> since Dec. 8. On Dec. 28, a resident of <LOCATION> Kiryat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arba </LOCATION> was slightly wounded when he was stabbed in the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Hours after Thursday's stabbing, a firebomb was hurled at a paramilitary border police patrol in <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s A-Tur neighborhood, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. There were no injuries or damage. Police spokesman <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said police strength in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> would remain at 1,200 because `` it's impossible to have police on every corner ... We are assuring everyone that the city is safe. This could have happened anywhere.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> annexed east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> but maintains military governments in the territories. <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> called the stabbing an isolated incident. `` This is a very sad case, but for the last six months, not one Jew or Arab has been killed in the city,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The mayor said the uprising has strained relations between <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s 340,000 Jews and 130,000 Arabs. `` We are living in an atmosphere of tension,'' <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> said.

 An <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> income tax credit is being proposed to spur more people to go to the polls in the wake of the worst voter turnout for any statewide election. `` I think it's in the best interest of government,'' said <LOCATION> Ada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Clerk <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bastida </PERSON>, who came up with the idea for a $ 5 voter tax credit. Unofficial turnout in Tuesday's primary was less than 25 percent of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s 520,000 registered voters. Initial checks showed turnout running about 22 percent in the larger counties and 15 percent in <LOCATION> Ada </LOCATION>, the state's largest. `` When 15 percent of the people are dictating to the other 85 percent who their leaders are going to be, I think that's bad,'' <PERSON> Bastida </PERSON> said. `` There ought to be something gained from the people going to the polls instead of saying, ` I do n't care. They're all crooks anyway.''' He said voters could be given a stamp when they cast their ballots and then place it on their state tax returns to show they qualified for the break. `` I think the Legislature ought to turn around and take a look at it,'' <PERSON> Bastida </PERSON> said.

 The mother of a 9-year-old girl who lost her lower legs to frostbite last winter after being locked in an unheated apartment was sentenced today to 14 years in prison for felony child neglect. <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maroc </PERSON> also said he will recommend treatment for <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Britt </PERSON>'s cocaine habit while the 29-year-old woman is in prison. The sentence had been specified in the plea bargain that spared the daughter, <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON>, from testifying against her mother and dropped two charges against the woman, but <PERSON> Maroc </PERSON> had the option of a shorter prison term. The offense carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Construction workers boarding up an abandoned <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> house Jan. 17 discovered the child alone an unheated apartment. Investigators said the girl had been in the apartment nearly 10 days during a spell of near-zero temperatures. Surgeons later amputated her gangrenous legs below the knee. On May 6, <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> pleaded guilty to felony neglect, but defense attorney <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Toomey </PERSON> said today he wanted to take the case to trial. He did not explain his reasons. However, <PERSON> Maroc </PERSON> told <PERSON> Britt </PERSON>: `` I think you are locked into the plea. I think it's a good plea, a valid one under the law.'' <PERSON> Toomey </PERSON> asked the woman if she still accepted the plea, and she said, `` I do n't want to go to trial.'' Child welfare authorities placed <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON> with her paternal grandmother after her release from the hospital. She has been fitted with artificial legs. `` She still holds affection for her mother even though she does n't want to live with her,'' said <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The rebel delegation to peace talks today accused the Sandinista government of breaking a promise to allow them to meet with domestic opposition groups in the capital. `` We came to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> because the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government had offered us free movement and that we would meet with the opposition parties, but that did n't occur last night,'' said <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON>, spokesman for the Nicaraguan Resistance. He said the rebel leaders had planned to meet Thursday night with the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordinate </ORGANIZATION>, which groups political parties and other groups that oppose the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Sandinista government told us that they would come here, and they told them that we would go there,'' <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> said. `` So, they were waiting for us there and we for them here, and there was n't a meeting. We're going to see if they -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- fulfill that promise today.'' Despite the shaky start to the peace talks, the two sides resumed talking this morning for the third round of top-level discussions in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> to seek an end to the 6 -LCB- - year war This round began on Thursday. The Sandinistas on Thursday rejected the Contras' offer to disarm if <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> embraces democracy. The Contras, as the rebels are known, demanded that the government guarantee complete press freedom within five days and abolish the military draft within 60. They also demanded that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> ease their control over the army and government and allow the rebels to resupply their forces in the field. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON>, the presidential spokesman, on Thursday described the plan as `` preposterous.'' `` The Contra proposal is unrealistic and casts aside all that has been done and agreed upon until now and makes new proposals,'' <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON> said. `` With this proposal, they're acting as if they had won the war and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> had surrendered,'' said Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said the government offered to discuss `` guarantees in the electoral process, dates for municipal elections, reforms in the electoral law, pluralistic representation in the electoral council and guarantees and norms for the functioning of a mixed economy.'' <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, chief of the rebel delegation, said the Contra offer contained `` democratic changes the country should make at the end of the war.'' <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said the rebels were prepared to make a `` special effort to achieve a definitive cease-fire.'' But he said the Contra delegates were not optimistic about the outcome of the meeting and said the government has not complied with a preliminary peace plan agreed upon March 23 in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>. At <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, a Nicaraguan town near the border with <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, the two sides agreed to a 60-day cease-fire and on the basis for further talks to arrange a permanent truce. The cease-fire expires May 30, but President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said this week he would extend it for an additional 30 days. Rebel leaders have said they want a permanent truce but will not break <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s unilateral extension of the cease-fire. Under what the rebels called a flexible timetable, they indicated they would lay down their arms sometime before Christmas. `` It seems they are trying to bypass the <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> agreement,'' said <PERSON> Bayardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arce </PERSON>, vice coordinator of the political commitee of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. In an interview, <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> said that Defense Minister Gen. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, head of the Nicaraguan delegation, told the <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> delegates `` that the logical thing was to continue the discussions under the <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> agreement.'' The delegations are meeting under tight security at the Camino Real Hotel. Contra representatives were permitted Thursday to leave the hotel to visit relatives and political leaders. Roman Catholic Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo and <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION>, attended as witnesses.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officer and the Marine enlisted man she married show that `` an officer and a gentleman can be a couple,'' their attorney said after a general dismissed fraternization charges. Lt. <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazure </PERSON>, 29, was cleared after a 4 -LCB- - hour hearing Tuesday before Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Deegan </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ground </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Combat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at Twentynine Palms `` The case ... was about whether the love of country by a member of the military could somehow automatically and in all circumstances preclude the love of another, also a member of the military,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Mazure </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, 24, who resigned from the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION>, showed that `` an officer and a gentleman could be a couple and that there was something sick and cockeyed about declaring for all members of the military _ even for members of different branches _ that love at first sight or anytime thereafter was always to be a crime,'' <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON> said Thursday. Price, of Eden, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, married Ms. <PERSON> Mazure </PERSON> on Nov. 28. Charges were brought Nov. 25, marking `` the first time in the history of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ... that charges of fraternization have been brought against an officer for conduct with a member of another branch of the service,'' <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON> said, emphasizing that the couple were not in the same chain of command. The charges had been recommended for court-martial. But on Tuesday, <PERSON> Deegan </PERSON> held a hearing that resulted in dismissal of the allegation, the attorney said. `` I love my husband. I love the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, and I do n't see why the two are not compatible,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Mazure </PERSON>, a dentist assigned to Twentynine Palms. `` I hope that from out of this the fraternization policy will become more defined.'' Ms. <PERSON> Mazure </PERSON> said that she was stationed in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, when she met Price during an evening of dancing in 1986 and that neither knew the other was in the service until after several dates. They kept in touch by mail when Price was transferred to the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> desert base in 1987.

 A judge has decided a 67-year-old man paralyzed in the crossfire of a crack cocaine shoot-out ca n't testify in the case because his appearance could prejudice the jury `` His speech therapist ... says he wants to testify, and I've been over and talked to him, and he indicated to me he wants to testify I ca n't believe we ca n't put the victim on the stand,'' said Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaffey </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Alameda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> ruled Wednesday after a hearing at the hospital bedside of <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who is paralyzed from the neck down and breathes with the help of a respirator. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s appearance could jeopardize the defendants' right to a fair trial, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. `` The man was an innocent victim who stepped out of his house and was shot _ he does n't remember anything,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Plumhoff </PERSON>, an assistant public defender in the assault trial of <PERSON> Nate </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, 20, and <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 19. <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> are charged with assault in the June 30, 1987, gunfight in which at least five men battled in the street outside <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s home. `` The only reason -LRB- te prosecutor -RRB- wanted to bring Mr. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> in was to prejudice the jury by showing how badly injured he was.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was shot in the neck with an <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> carbine as <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>'s gang shot it out with a rival gang led by <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, 21, who is believed to have fired the shot that struck <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the prosecutor said. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> was killed by three men who broke into his bedroom in August 1987. <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> have been charged with the attack on <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, under the `` vicarious liability'' legal theory that says all participants of a crime are equally responsible.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, claiming the bracing <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> air had invigorated him to step up his battle against Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, declared today, `` I'm the underdog and I like it.'' `` He is the front-runner. He's been decreed that by poll after poll,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters in a news conference on the lawn of his oceanside retreat. `` Do I worry about it? I do n't worry about it. I like fighting back,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, brushing off recent polls suggesting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' lead has been widening He called for a resumption of collpased negotiations to remove Panamanian Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power, though he had previously expressed reservations about the talks. He said the talks should also include other nations if possible. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> branded as `` an outrageous lie'' what he said was a reported suggestion by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> that the negotiations were meant to help <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign. `` When you read these outrageous charges by a drug-related, indicted dictator, discount them. They are total lies,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, with the pounding surf of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> to his back, also said if elected he would personnally countermand any effort by the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to close off the nearby waters to lobstermen as a security precaution. `` That is absolutely absurd,'' he said. `` They will continue to fish here and they will continue to be welcome.'' As a sole lobster boat worked its pots in a cove several hundred yards away, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would give up coming to his <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> retreat rather than see the waters closed. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is here for a week of talks with advisers and prominent Republicans. Among today's visitors were Govs. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> as well as former <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> and former deputy Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>. Of the recent polls, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` things are n't in focus yet. It is May. The election is in November.'' A <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Post-ABC poll today reported that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had a 13-point lead over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ and that among female voters, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor was ahead by a 60-30 margin. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> conceded that the `` gender gap'' was a major concern. He said it was at the top of today's discussion list, in fact. `` What I've got to do is more clearly define what I feel on certain women's issues. One of them will be day care.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised to come out of his one-week break swinging. `` When I get up here I feel _ it's not feistiness _ but I feel very relaxed about it. I do n't feel troubled by somebody pointing out I'm behind in the polls. ... I'm coming out of 10 points down in these polls and I've got five months to fight back.'' `` There's a little bit of a cholesterol rise, the frustration level going up, in terms of sitting around and listening to -LRB- <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> dump all over me and the the administration. So I'm beginning to get a little more combative,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. One day earlier, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pollster <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON> conceded that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` gender gap'' seemed to be far worse than that ever faced by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who also had more support among men than women voters. `` It's largely for institutional reasons. It's got more to do with party than it does with candidates. But it did close in 1984 as we got close to the election, although it never closed completely. There is an institutional and a party gender gap and we're going to make a very strong effort to close it,'' <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> staff chief <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said that the vice president would focus on domestic affairs in sessions on Friday and Saturday and would meet with economic advisers next Tuesday and Wednesday to flesh out his fall campaign positions. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was not overly concerned about recent polls that showed him falling behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` There are some advantages to being the underdog and fighting back,'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said. Campaigning in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> on Thursday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> focused on the war against drugs, calling for a requirement that government contracts be awarded only to companies that have `` drug free'' programs for their employes. Aides said that the proposal could involve some form of mandatory drug testing for all companies doing busines with the government, although details had not been worked out. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also called for an international drug `` strike force'' that would seek out and destroy drug crops wherever they were found. And he said he would put `` a single military figure'' in charge of coordinating <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> participation in such an effort. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said that the overall anti-drug effort in his administration would be headed by the vice president.

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today he is unperturbed by polls that give likely <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a double-digit lead, adding that `` I like fighting back.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, for his part, scoffed at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s drug proposals and asked `` Why have n't these been done in the past seven years?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made quick stops in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, one of four states that will hold end-of-the-season primaries on June 7, while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> settled in for a week of strategy sessions at his summer home in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. `` I do n't feel troubled out by somebody pointing out I'm behind in the polls,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters. `` I'm coming out 10 points down in these polls and I've got five months to fight back.'' `` I like that position,'' he added, noting that he lost <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s first-in-the-nation's caucuses in February but came back to clinch the Republican nomination handily <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, meanwhile, was wrapping up a 10-day stay in the West today. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been campaigning hard in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, but polls suggest he is running well behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the state, with its big primary only 11 days away. There are 314 delegates are at stake in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> contest, and primaries the same day in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> offer another 162 delegates. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> hopes to clinch the Democratic nomination in that round of races. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has been focusing less on his slim chance of winning the nomination and more on his efforts to influence the Democratic platform, claimed credit on Thursday for bringing the front-running <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> closer to his point of view on some issues. `` He is adjusting to a new agenda,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told a rally in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides, though, say the governor is listening to what <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has to say but not making any major changes in his positions `` We're not going to negotiate our basic stands,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> said Thursday. `` You're not going to see any kind of fundamental shifts.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> himself rarely makes mention of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> these days. He reserves his disdain almost exclusively for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, particularly <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who already has enough delegates for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor was campaigning in <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, on Thursday, hours after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called for the creation of an international anti-drug strike force, a drug summit, and the denial of government contracts to companies lacking anti-drug programs. The vice president's proposals, described by aides as a major anti-drug initiative, came in a speech before he visited a drug-rehabilitation center in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <PERSON> N.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said that he was n't impressed with the recommendations. `` The question is, why have n't these been done in the past seven years? Is n't the vice president in charge of this effort?'' he asked, referring to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s position as head of an anti-drug task force. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arrived Thursday night at his vacation home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where he intends to spend a week conferring with aides and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders. One topic certain to be discussed is a string of recent polls indicating <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is running behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The latest such survey, by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a 13-point advantage. According to the poll published in today's editions of the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leads <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> 53 percent to 40 percent. The survey also suggested that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is viewed unfavorably by nearly four times as many people as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is _ by 37 percent, compared with 10 percent in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' case. The Post-ABC survey also said that when voters were asked about problems facing the country, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> scored better on national defense, but he trailed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on a dozen other issues, including the fight against drugs. The survey, based on telephone interviews with 1,172 adults between May 19 to May 26, had a margin of error of plus orminus 3 percentage points, the newspaper said. The vice president's pollster, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON>, said Thursday that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign was concerned about the recent polls, but said findings in May do n't necessarily point to trouble in November. `` You'd rather be ahead. But there surely is no feeling of crisis or panic,'' <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON> said. `` We're a long way ahead of the election.'' Meanwhile, both Democrats continued to hammer away at what is becoming a familiar campaign theme _ the administration's dealings with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military leader, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> pointed to the `` disgraceful practice of negotiating with drug dealers, which discredits our government and is beneath our dignity.'' And <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` I'm going to continue to insist on a full explanation from the administration about what's going on'' with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` Are there links with the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>? Who were the people that were involved in drug-running and profit-skimming? And who was it in this administration who thought that made sense?'' he asked. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has been trying for months to induce <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to relinquish his post. The general is under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment on drug-trafficking charges, which the administration had offered to drop to get him out of power. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, meanwhile, was facing a problem at home that Republicans hope will prove an embarrassment _ a $ 110 million tax increase that is headed for his desk. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> makes frequent reference when campaigning to his reputation as a tax-cutting governor. The tax package includes $ 70 million to tie the state income tax to the federal code and $ 40 million from a cigarette tax, and is aimed at helping alleviate budget problems. However, the governor has insisted that the state budget can be balanced without the tax proposal.

 In five weeks, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has dramatically turned the tables on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> with two major battlefield victories that have aggravated <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s military and political troubles. The military defeats have badly jolted <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which was already beset by economic woes, a political power struggle between radicals and conservatives, and growing international isolation. `` There's a lot of confusion in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> now,'' said a Western diplomatic source with contacts in the Iranian capital. `` But the Iranians will not take this lying down. They'll retaliate.'' `` They may be on the ropes, but they're not on their knees yet,'' said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The unexpectedly aggressive tactics of the Iraqis, who for the last six years have been content to fight a static war behind their formidable defense lines, appeared to catch the Iranians flat-footed twice in just over a month. The Iraqi 3rd <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, spearheaded by brigades of the elite <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, drove the Iranians out of marshlands east of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s southern port city of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> on Wednesday. The 7th Corps, again led by <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> units, recaptured the <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION> south of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> in a 34-hour assault that ended April 18. For <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the loss of that territory was a major psychological and political blow. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> took back the most significant gains <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had to show for 7 -LCB- years of war. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> also stole Iranian bargaining chips in any future peace talks in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war. Moreover, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> was suffering other military setbacks. The same day the <ORGANIZATION> Faw </ORGANIZATION> battle ended, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sank one of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s missile frigates and a missile-attack craft and disabled another frigate after destroying two of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s offshore oil platforms. The battles seriously damaged <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s naval power. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> sought to save face by staging big naval maneuvers. But Western sources said although <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> boasted that 55 vessels took part in the maneuvers, only five modern warships and an aging destroyer were assembled with small craft. `` They're clearly in no shape to take on the Americans again, but the Revolutionary Guards in their armed speedboats remain a menace,'' said a European naval specialist, who spoke on condition of anonymity. However, it may well be too soon to consider these defeats a turning point in the seemingly interminable gulf war. `` The Iraqis are clearly determined to reclaim their territory,'' said <PERSON> Hans-Heino </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopietz </PERSON>, an analyst with the London-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. `` But they do n't seem to be interested in going across the border into <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> again,'' he said in a telephone interview. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in September 1980 after weeks of border skirmishes. The Iranians initially were overwhelmed but drove the Iraqis back across the frontier by 1982. Afterward, the Iranians held the initiative in the ground war _ until last month. The sudden change in Iraqi strategy may stem from <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>'s frustration with the failure of the <ORGANIZATION> U. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to impose sanctions on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for not heeding a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution passed in July <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has resisted international pressure to talk about peace, despite its growing economic turmoil. Iraqi air raids on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s oil industry, its economic lifeline, have taken their toll. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is now importing unprecedented amounts of refined products, like kerosene and jet fuel. Moreover, the slump in the value of the dollar, to which oil prices are pegged, has cut revenues that <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> needs to pay for its war effort. Up to half of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s 6 million people fled to the countryside to escape <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> missiles that blasted a path of destruction across the city from Feb. 29 to April 21. There are signs that <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s ability to wage war has been hurt. The Iranians failed to launch an expected major offensive during the winter, when bad weather favors <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> by neutralizing <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s superior air power and armor It was the first time in six years the Iranians failed to launch a major winter push.

<HEAD>UN Relief Coordinator Sees War Delaying Refugee Return</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said Friday that continuing warfare in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> could delay the return of more than 5 million war refugees. Prince <PERSON> Sadruddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Aga </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>' relief coordinator for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, said he could not predict how many of the refugees plan to return. Most are in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. `` It's common sense that people do not feel very encouraged to go home if they know there is still fighting,'' <PERSON> Sadruddin </PERSON> told reporters. But `` the one incentive which will encourage them to go home as quickly as possible is that they love their country and feel very homesick,'' he said. He said respecting last month's <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords, which call for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the safe and voluntary return of refugees, was `` paramount'' for peace. Soviet troops entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979 to help the Afghan government fight a civil war with anti-communist guerrillas, and they began pulling out of the country May 15. The guerrillas have said they will continue fighting until the Afghan government falls. <PERSON> Sadruddin </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on Friday for <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, where he will talk with government leaders and refugee experts on the relief and repatriation effort. It is his first trip to the region since <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> named him to oversee the refugee return. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> will appeal in June for funds to launch the program, said <PERSON> Sadruddin </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees. But `` if the conflict continues, it will be difficult to put the structures into place,'' <PERSON> Sadruddin </PERSON> said. Land mines littering the countryside after 10 years of civil war must be removed `` before anyone can go back,'' he said. An internal <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> document compiled last month predicted it would cost about $ 130 million for 1 million refugees to return and $ 324 million for the return of 3 million refugees. About 2.4 million Afghans live in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and another 3.1 million live in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures.

<TEXT>
 A 10-year-old girl found two pieces of poisoned chocolate on a roadside in southwestern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on Friday, the latest in a series of poisoned candy incidents since September. <PERSON> Hideyoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Bando </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Tokushima </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prefectural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, said the child, who did not eat the candy, found it on her way to school near the town of <LOCATION> Itano </LOCATION>. She reported it to a teacher, who notified police. <PERSON> Bando </PERSON> said preliminary tests on the chocolate indicated the presence of a highly poisonous acid. The incident was the second such case in two months in the <LOCATION> Tokushima </LOCATION> region, 320 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Three pieces of poisoned chocolate were found April 3 in the grass near a religious shrine in the area. Chocolates tainted with poison were first discovered in two schools in neighboring <LOCATION> Kagawa </LOCATION> region on Sept. 8, 1987, and similar incidents were reported the same month in at least three other <LOCATION> Tokushima </LOCATION> schools. Police suspect the same person or group is responsible for the string of incidents.

 The government will sell its limousines in a cost-cutting drive that also requires agencies to reduce staffs by up to 50 percent, a state-run newspaper reported Friday. The black Tatra limousines, symbols of power and prestige in communist <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, will be sold to the public, the daily Rude Pravo said. It did not say how many limousines would be put up for sale. Officials have ordered ministries and departments to reduce staffs by up to 50 percent in 1988-89 to save money. The government has already begun to put into place 30 percent cuts that will affect 5,800 workers by the end of 1989, the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
 Movie buffs expecting to see a classic film about British military hero Adm. <PERSON> Horatio </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> instead got a soft-porn flick about <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>'s love affair with an aristocrat. A spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Watershed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said a mislabeled film container caused the mix-up Thursday night. The center planned to show `` Lady <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>,'' the 1941 film starring <PERSON> Vivian </PERSON> <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> that tells the story of <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> and his love affair. Center spokeswoman <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> said `` <PERSON> Emma </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>,'' the pornographic movie about the same subject, was mistakenly put in the film can. About half the audience of 20 walked out when shots of a half-naked woman appeared on screen. `` The film can was labeled ` <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>,' and we believe it was a catalog error by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>. `` The projection staff soon realized something was wrong and stopped the film.'' `` <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>,'' also called `` That Hamilton Woman,'' was a U.S.-made film designed to increase pro-British sentiment during World War II. It was reportedly <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>'s favorite movie. Ms. <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> said irate patrons received their money back along with a free ticket to another show. The center showed `` Streetcar Named Desire'' that night.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in his first visit to the Soviet capital, will see an enormous city of 12-lane boulevards dominated in part by seven massive Stalin-era Baroque buildings. He will see the city at its best: the lilacs are blooming, the weather is mild and downtown stores are stocked with meat and tomatoes. Arriving for the first time in the Soviet capital is at times like taking a trip back in time. The electrical appliances seem old-fashioned and traffic jams are rare, though smog has taken hold. Nearly 9 million people live here, yet the only time it seems crowded is when people are queuing to buy food, perfume, and other scarce consumer goods. Humans are dwarfed by immense buildings, both the charmless, modern structures from the 1960s _ said to be modeled on buildings <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> saw and liked in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> _ and a variety of monuments to mother <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>'s war heroes. Few of the cars are new, almost all are Soviet-made, and taxicabs seem scarce, at least to the legion of visitors who arrived this week to prepare for the Reagan-Gorbachev summit. Most Muscovites do not own cars, and so while <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and Politburo members are whisked into the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> during the morning rush hour and out again at dusk, millions of commuters use the city's excellent subway or local bus and trolley systems. The Kremlin is not one big building, like the Pentagon for example. Instead, it is a walled citadel of government buildings, cathedrals, towers and arsenals dating back to the 14th Century. `` <LOCATION> Alcatraz </LOCATION> on the outside, <LOCATION> Versailles </LOCATION> on the inside,'' in the words of one American. Some of the city's best known sites _ the red-and-white and yellow-and-blue onion domes of St. Basil's Cathedral, cobblestoned Red Square and the Bolshoi Theater _ sit just outside the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> ` s red-brick wall. The words `` grim,'' `` drab,'' `` dreary,' and `` unkempt'' are often used to describe <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, but the sunny skies _ the first in 10 months _ the sweet-smelling purple lilacs and the pre-summit spruce-up helps overcome the feeling of grayness brought on in large part by decades of listless architecture. `` It's not <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, but it's a lot prettier that it was two months ago,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. Soldiers, in their gray tunics and green hats, are shining the huge swinging metal doors on government buildings. Women on hands and knees are planting begonias in front of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> wall, workers are mowing the grass sprinkled with yellow dandelions and plasterers are touching up the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will visit A three-man team is painting the flagpoles of the <LOCATION> Pushkin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION>. Residents seem excited about the upcoming <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> visit. At the Hotel Rossiya, home to many of the American journalists and officials working at the summit, the local employees _ not widely known for wasting pleasantries _ are going out of their way to be helpful. The dezhurni, Russian `` key ladies'' who are posted day and night on each hotel floor _ smile when you turn in the key after leaving the room. Service may be slow, but this week at least it is service with a smile. `` Service is impossible here,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, a businessman from <LOCATION> Basking </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, who has dealt with the Soviets in his advertising business. `` There's no motivation, that's the problem,'' he said. Black and his wife, <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON>, say they have deep affection for the Soviet people. `` When you get to know them, they are very nice,'' he said. For Americans, the language barrier is a real problem, he said, because the Soviets may seem rude when they are really just embarrassed at not being able to communicate. While Soviet bureaucrats and law enforcement officials generally wear a dour expression, young people were smiling as they strolled in the May sunshine along the broad sidewalks of <LOCATION> Kalinin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prospekt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s `` Fifth Avenue,'' where behind the glass shop windows are a paltry number of fashions and consumer products. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has little street crime, no doubt partly a result of the omnipresence of police. There are so many uniformed officers that they sometimes seem to be watching one another. The <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> militia says none of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s 60 banks has been robbed in 20 years. The hotels have plenty of food on hand for the summit, attracting large numbers of Soviets who filled their bellies, and in some cases their pockets, with such rarities as tomatoes, sausages and cheese _ items that the locals say have not been seen for weeks in most stores. The beriozkas, special hotel shops which accept only Western currency, are freshly stocked for the summit, and foreign residents of the city have been seen carting cases of wine to their waiting cars _ a basic precaution in a society where such commodities may not reappear for months. <PERSON> Renee </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, a teacher from <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said her biggest disappointment on her trip to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is that the facilities are `` dirty and unhygienic.'' But that hardly affected her trip, she said. `` The people are so nice and they love Americans,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 A medical examiner under investigation for supplementing his income selling bones from the dead for up to $ 425 a body had the approval of his superiors, the county's chief administrator says. `` Unless we are given some new information that it legally should not continue, then it will,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Vickers </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Bexar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> commission. County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> DiMaio </PERSON> said Thursday he earned about $ 50,000 since 1983 removing bones for the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Bone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, which used them in transplants. Prosecutors are examining whether he violated the law in removing the bones in county facilities or on county time, said Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> `` Skip'' <PERSON> Atwell </PERSON>. `` We will talk to him and the county auditor and then we'll sit down and evaluate the thing and see if it's a commissioner's court issue, or something we should be involved in or something nobody should be involved in,'' <PERSON> Atwell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> DiMaio </PERSON>, who was among several pathologists who exhumed <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON>'s body in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> for reexamination in 1981, said he has charged between $ 175 and $ 425 per body for removing bones from corpses sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION>'s Office. A gunshot wound expert who also supplements his $ 92,000-a-year salary by testifying at civil and criminal trials, <PERSON> DiMaio </PERSON> said that he had county approval and that consent forms were obtained from survivors. `` I charged for my time, on my own time, not on the county's time,'' he said `` They may be able to change their minds, but they ca n't ever say they were n't informed.'' <PERSON> Vickers </PERSON> said that the county commissioners in 1983 agreed to let <PERSON> DiMaio </PERSON> do work for the <ORGANIZATION> Bone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and decided the county would bill the foundation $ 25 per case for use of the facilities, <PERSON> Vickers </PERSON> said. `` It was all above board,'' <PERSON> Vickers </PERSON> said. `` As far as I can tell, he did n't try to hide anything. His statement was given in open court, in front of attorneys and auditors.'' <PERSON> DiMaio </PERSON> likened his role to a physician removing a heart from an accident victim for use in another transplant. `` Everyone is paid for their services,'' he said. At the foundation, the bones are cleaned and chopped into pieces and freeze-dried for use in transplants, mostly for back, dental or reconstructive surgery.

He told the Indians today that they should not surrender their values. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> hearkened back to the beginning of his <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> and called for people to work together. `` Hispanics in the barrios, blacks in the ghettos, ranchers on ranches, Indians on reservations. ... There's a tendency of these people to be abandoned by law,'' he said. `` The real challenge is to begin to pull together our various backgrounds and find common ground ... to turn to each other and not on each other.'' On Thursday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spoke to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> as the group opened its annual convention here, and he lamented what he said were inequities women face in society. `` Half our nation is female. Half of our poor children live in a house run by poor women where there is no man,'' he said. `` Women make 65 cents on a dollar to what a man makes. ... `` Your self-respect is not negotiable,'' he said. `` You've earned the right to expect ERA -LRB- the Equal Rights Amendment -RRB- to be in the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- platform. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was to speak to the women's group later today. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also talked of the government's need to stop the flow of drugs into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Drugs affect our family. Drugs affect our children in schools. Drugs affect the safety of our streets,'' he said. `` Drugs are the No. 1 threat to our national security.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, in the final weeks of campaigning for his party's nomination, made several campaign appearances in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> earlier in the day The obviously tired and hoarse candidate also criticized a small movement in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that wants to make English the official language of the country in a reference to the upcoming summit between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is going to meet with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> this week in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` It's the right thing to do. It's a step in the right direction. ... I hope our translator does not speak English only.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> was the second this month. Polls indicate <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is running far behind <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for the June 7 primary. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has 1,700 delegates for the nomination, while <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has 983 according to the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Another 443 delegates still are uncommitted, and a candidate needs at least 2,081 to win the nomination. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> will have 28 delegates to the Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> this summer.

<TEXT>
 Hoping to buy time for victims of one of the bleakest forms of cancer, a West German surgeon is repairing livers outside the body, a procedure believed to be the first of its kind. `` I think it may help some patients for whom we could n't do anything else,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Pichlmayr </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hannover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pichlmayr </PERSON> said that he has removed, repaired and replaced livers three times, including twice this month. Malignant liver tumors left no choice, he said. The repairs took four to five hours. The patients, two women and a man, were doing well, <PERSON> Pichlmayr </PERSON> said Thursday by telephone from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` They are improved dramatically,'' he said. `` I'm afraid those patients might get a reoccurrence of the disease. But I feel the justification to do it because it's the best possible retaliation'' against cancer. He said that because of the nature of liver cancer, the patients would probably eventually develop new tumors, either in the liver or elsewhere, but the operation at least will prolong their lives. Previously, such bench surgery was limited to the well-established repair of blood vessels or the removal of cysts and tumors in kidneys, which are less delicate and less vital to sustaining life than the liver. `` It's a very intriguing development,'' said liver transplant pioneer Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>. `` I can see how it might be a significant advance, although we really must wait and see,'' he said. `` My hat's off to him. It's a monumental effort,'' said liver transplant surgeon Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Najarian </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>. He has tried liver transplants on four liver cancer patients, only one of whom is still alive. Liver cancer is among the deadlier forms of the disease, said <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahaney </PERSON>. Early detection gives patients a 10 percent to 30 percent chance of surviving for five years. Late detection leaves a mere 3 percent chance. <PERSON> Pichlmayr </PERSON> performed the first operation Feb. 5 to remove cancer that more than doubled the weight of a 40-year-old woman's liver. The woman has since returned home. He said a transplant might have wasted a valuable donor organ because the cancer had spread beyond her liver, and he avoided traditional in-body repairs because of the tumor's size and central location. As he removed the organ, <PERSON> Pichlmayr </PERSON> installed a pump that kept blood flowing through the two main explosed blood vessels. Outside the body, the liver was cooled with ice water and flushed periodically with a special fluid to keep it fresh. <PERSON> Pichlmayr </PERSON> described the procedure in a West German medical journal in April. `` She's gained weight again, and at this moment she's very healthy,'' he said. `` She was suffering extremely, and I think she would not be alive now.'' <PERSON> Pichlmayr </PERSON> performed liver bench surgery again May 6 on a 48-year-old woman and May 11 on a 58-year-old man. `` The lady is at home, quite well,'' he said. `` The man is still in the hospital, but is good.'' Also this year, <PERSON> Pichlmayr </PERSON> did the world's first split-liver transplant, dividing one liver and implanting the halves into two patients.

<HEAD>Sikhs Kill Seven; Security Corridor To Be Built Around Golden
Temple</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sikh terrorists killed seven people Friday in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state, and two people died of injuries suffered in an earlier bomb blast. The government announced plans to shut off the Golden Temple to militant Sikhs. Home Minister <PERSON> Buta </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, whose ministry is responsible for internal security, told reporters the government would carve out a 100-yard corridor around the temple complex to try to keep extremists from using the shrine as a hideout. The office of President <PERSON> Ramaswami </PERSON> <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON> announced that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 30-year-old Arms Act had been amended to provide stringent punishment for the use of outlawed firearms. Under the amendment, a person convicted of possessing prohibited arms such as rocket launchers could be sentenced to life in prison. The government says Sikh extremists are bringing these more sophisticated arms in from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Previously, the maximum sentence was three years in prison. The moves came one day after the president issued an ordinance making it illegal for temples and other religious sites to be used for political purposes. The ordinance also would make harboring a wanted criminal in a shrine punishable by imprisonment or a fine. Two of the people who died Friday were Hindu laborers injured Thursday when a bomb went off in a crowded market in the town of <LOCATION> Phagwara </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Kapurthala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> east of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. The bombing was blamed on the <PERSON> Barbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalsa </PERSON> gang, one of a dozen Sikh extremist groups operating in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. It was the latest in a series of attacks on migrant workers. Police believe the extremists are trying to drive Hindu laborers out of the state and undercut its agricultural economy. Seven other deaths were reported Friday, including a Sikh father and son shot to death by Sikh gunmen in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. There were no details on the other slayings. The latest killings raised to more than 1,180 the number of deaths blamed on <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> extremists in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> since the start of the year. In all of 1987, 1,030 people died. Most victims of Sikh violence have been Hindus, but moderate Sikhs are also targeted by the militants who have been fighting since 1982 for a separate nation in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said houses and shops around the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION>'s holiest shrine, would be razed to make way for the security corridor He said construction would begin soon, but he did n't give a date. <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chidambaram </PERSON>, <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s deputy, said about 700 families and 300 shops would be displaced but that the government would set up a resettlement program for those forced to move. The decision to build the corridor follows a 10-day siege by police and paramilitary troops to drive Sikh radicals from the temple. The stand-off ended May 18 when the last of about 200 Sikh extremists and sympathizers inside the temple surrendered. At least 46 people were killed in the confrontation, most of them militants. Police still patrol around the shrine, but security efforts are hampered because scores of shops, houses and narrow alleys abutting the complex provide cover for militants moving around the area. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a Sikh himself, was asked if there was a political solution to the situation. He responded: `` Do you think these terrorists have any political aims other than their declared goal of <LOCATION> Khalistan </LOCATION>? If that is the thing, then we do n't have a political solution.'' <LOCATION> Khalistan </LOCATION> is the name that Sikhs envision for their nation. Sikhs are a religious minority in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and claim they are discriminated against by the majority Hindus. They form the majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state.

 There's no free lunch at Uncle <PERSON> Bob </PERSON>'s Diner In fact there's no lunch at all _ no sunny side up, no french fries with gravy, no coffee. The only food on <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Berta </PERSON>'s menu nourishes the soul. All that's cooking in the kitchen of what is now `` The Diner Store'' are other diners _ only smaller. <PERSON> Berta </PERSON>, a 37-year-old sculptor, has been creating ceramic diners for 12 years _ from art-deco salt-and-pepper shakers to diners eight inches high and 15 inches long, with working neon signs. The diner-within-a-diner has fascinated <PERSON> Berta </PERSON> for years. But the chance to set up his gallery in Uncle <PERSON> Bob </PERSON>'s Diner, believed to be <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s last remaining diner when it closed 15 years ago, was more than he had hoped for. `` People all over knew about Uncle <PERSON> Bob </PERSON>'s,'' <PERSON> Berta </PERSON> said Thursday. `` I had a guy from <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, write to me, saying he'd spent every night for four years in the'50s at this place.'' <PERSON> Berta </PERSON> came across the 41-year-old, abandoned diner in <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION> in 1986, bought it for $ 2,000 and had mobile home transporters move it 125 miles to the tiny town of <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rapids </LOCATION>, where he's lived with his artist-wife for 15 years. He has spent the last year working on the 53-by-32-foot eatery to restore its original pink formica ceilings, porcelain enamel exterior and stainless steel sunburst patterns. `` It looks just the same as in 1947, when it was built,'' <PERSON> Berta </PERSON> says, swiveling on one of the diner's original stools. While the gallery does n't open for business until June 15, the opening reception is Friday. All told, the project has cost him about $ 50,000. `` It sounds real crazy, but it's going to be great making diners in a diner,'' says <PERSON> Berta </PERSON>, sporting a tuxedo with bright-red bowtie and high-top sneakers to match. `` Lots of times people are intimidated when they walk into a gallery,'' he says. `` People are going to feel real comfortable when they walk in here.'' The kitchen will be his studio, and the counters and shelves where miniature boxes of cereal undoubtedly sat years ago will be the showplace for his art, which ranges from $ 60 to about $ 1,000. Inside some of the diners are tiny <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> signs and ceramic utensils and food on counter tops. <PERSON> Berta </PERSON> said he became intrigued with creating his own interpretations of the nearly extinct eateries after designing tiny ceramic rooms. `` I did a diner one day and it was my favorite, so I just kept going,'' he says. <PERSON> Berta </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Madeline </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaczmarczyk </PERSON>, who creates ceramic teapot sculptures and also will exhibit her work at the gallery, do the majority of their business at art fairs and exhibits across the country. And while they do n't know how strong business will be in this relatively conservative region in southwest <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, the two <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> natives hope to draw potential customers from as far away as their hometown and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> chose a new prime minister from outside his governing party in an effort to widen his support base as Soviet troops withdraw, leaving the government to face Moslem guerrillas alone. However, the president's choice, 62-year-old <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharq </PERSON>, has been closely associated with the party. He has been a deputy prime minister in <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government for the past 11 months. His promotion, announced late Thursday by official <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> radio, must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, which is expected to convene in a few days. Confirmation is virtually certain because the body is controlled by <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and allied groups. <PERSON> Sharq </PERSON> was entrusted with primary responsibility for repatriating an estimated 5 million refugees _ one-third of the country's population _ who have fled since Soviet troops entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979 to help the government in its war with the guerrillas He would replace Prime Minister <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Keshtmand </PERSON>, a ranking member of the governing party since its founding in 1965. <PERSON> Keshtmand </PERSON>, 52, was appointed to the post in 1981 by <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Babrak </PERSON> <PERSON> Karmal </PERSON> <PERSON> Keshtmand </PERSON> was named secretary of the central committee of the governing party. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> has repeatedly professed a desire to bring more non-party men into his government as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> withdraws its troop. However, the test of whether such a declaration will have real basis or be primarily cosmetic may come when <ORGANIZATION> Sharq </ORGANIZATION>'s Cabinet is named. `` If they simply move to reshuffle the furniture, it's not going to be significant,'' a Western diplomat said Friday. Most of the current 34 Cabinet members are either members of the party or closely tied to it. The exact breakdown is unknown because of the shadowy nature of Afghan politics. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s declarations of plans to broaden his government has not ended guerrilla attacks. From their bases in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the guerrillas have announced they captured at least a dozen Afghan army border posts since April 15, when the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agreed to start pulling out its troops.

The restoration of the king, in a role ranging from figurehead to active player, has been a topic of speculation in both <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and Western diplomatic circles since the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> decided to end its military intervention. <PERSON> Sharq </PERSON> was Cabinet chief of staff when <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON>, a cousin of the former king, served as prime minister from 1953 to 1963.

 An ex-convict tricked a lawyer into sending him a resume then assumed the attorney's identity, collecting thousands of dollars in legal fees and defending a man in court before disappearing, authorities said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Klaver </PERSON> was out of prison awaiting retrial in a rape case when he began impersonating <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Keffler </PERSON>, a real-life lawyer in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> who also practices in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Seminole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> authorities said. <PERSON> Klaver </PERSON> had all the credentials of a lawyer, including an ID card from the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bar </LOCATION> and numerous law books. He collected more than $ 3,000 in retainer fees from clients and appeared before <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> on April 18, representing a drug user. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said Wednesday he had been suspicious about <PERSON> Klaver </PERSON> but did n't say anything at the time. `` I thought he was the defendant,'' said the judge. `` I guess to judges, lawyers are like pornography _ we do n't know what it is, but we know it when we see it.'' The case eventually was reassigned to a real lawyer, with the client pleading guilty to cocaine possession. Investigators said <PERSON> Klaver </PERSON>, who was released from prison in December when his conviction and 60-year rape sentence were overturned, had called Keffler in March. <PERSON> Keffler </PERSON> said <PERSON> Klaver </PERSON> claimed to be a business owner planning to expand into <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. He said the man wanted him to handle the firm's legal matters <PERSON> Keffler </PERSON> sent <PERSON> Klaver </PERSON> his resume. Within weeks, <PERSON> Klaver </PERSON> was pretending to be Keffler, police said. <LOCATION> Seminole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's Sgt. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Human </PERSON> and Deputy <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Yolton </PERSON> said <PERSON> Klaver </PERSON> moved into an office also used by attorney <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Blakeley </PERSON> after telling her he was being placed on a list of lawyers available for court-appointed work. <PERSON> Klaver </PERSON> began taking cases and accepting fees. `` He appeared legitimate,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Blakeley </PERSON>. `` All his references checked out.'' Officials discovered the ruse after a man charged with writing bad checks complained that his lawyer had abandoned him after collecting a $ 200 retainer. Investigators have asked the state attorney's office to file charges of forgery, obtaining property by false impersonation and theft against <PERSON> Klaver </PERSON>. A spokesman for the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bar </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Butterfield </PERSON>, said the bar may have to tighten controls on its ID cards, possibly adding photographs. Ms. <PERSON> Blakeley </PERSON> said that when <PERSON> Klaver </PERSON> disappeared, he took more than $ 10,000 in law books and computer equipment, including all her business records, and collected about $ 10,000 from her own clients.

 Five old trucks and buses, driven by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> veterans, left the capital Friday as part of the nationwide `` Veterans Peace Convoy'' bearing food, medical supplies, clothing and toys for the children of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The contingent will merge June 5 in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, with several other conveys that originated in northern cities a week ago. Then the entire group, involving 50 vehicles and 100 drivers, will begin the drive through <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Livesay </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Dorchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, veteran who hatched the project and heads the group that started in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said a total of about 40 tons of humanitarian aid will be delivered by the convoy to private relief agencies in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` This is a people-to-people project to feed children, not a government one to feed war,'' <PERSON> Livesay </PERSON> said. The veterans' drive also is designed to promote the larger `` Let <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> Live'' program, under which various peace groups plan to send 4,200 tons of oats to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> via container ships this year. The various legs of the convoy will pass through 40 states, with stops in 90 cities, <PERSON> Livesay </PERSON> said. Other groups started in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>;, <LOCATION> Missoula </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mont </PERSON>.; <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, Ore. Among the donated supplies driven by the veterans are hospital equipment, powdered milk, and oral rehydration salts to help battle diarrhea, the No. 1 cause of death among Nicaraguan infants. The trucks also will carry stuffed animals and baseball equipment for the children. <PERSON> Livesay </PERSON> said he got the idea for the drive during a trip to northern <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> last fall on behalf of the Veterans for Peace. When another veteran mentioned the possibility of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion aimed at <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government, he said, `` Something clicked. I said he ought to invade this place ourselves with a convoy of real humanitarian aid.'' <PERSON> Livesay </PERSON> said, `` The kids were saw were malnourished, with discolored hair and distended stomachs, without clothes. The war had really begun to destroy the ability of the people in the countryside to produce.'' `` I saw the situation developing the same way it did in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Livesay </PERSON>, who worked for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> security branch in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> in the 1960s. `` I could n't believe that after 20 years, we just had n't learned our lesson.''

<HEAD>Best Advice for Drugs in Pregnancy: Ask A Doctor
^With AM-Accutane Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The best way to avoid harmful drugs during pregnancy is to refrain from all medications, except those specifically approved by your doctor for use during your pregnancy, medical authorities say. In addition, consumers can learn about pregnancy-related risks of a drug by asking a pharmacist to see the labeling, or by checking the pharmacist's copy of the Physicians' Desk Reference. Here is a partial list of drugs other than Accutane that experts recommend avoiding during pregnancy, or which should be taken only with approval of a physician: - Aspirin. - Blood-thinning drugs derived from a substance called coumarin. They are taken for heart-related disorders. - Cancer drugs that are cytotoxic, which means they kill cells. - Drugs containing any male or female hormone such as estrogens, progesterone or anabolic steroids. - Some anticonvulsants; a physician can prescribe lower-risk ones. - Cough syrup with a large percentage of alcohol. - Minor tranquilizers such as Valium or <LOCATION> Librium </LOCATION>. - Etretinate, used for severe psoriasis. - Vitamins A or B. In large doses they are linked to birth defects.

<HEAD>Air Force Decides Against Suspending Eastern</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> announced today it would continue to allow <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> the right to carry military passengers but said it would closely watch the carrier after inspectors reported `` performance deficiences.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> said Eastern was the subject of a `` commercial carrier survey'' in March. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> inspectors said they found `` performance deficiencies which, if not corrected, could affect the safety of the half-million <ORGANIZATION> DOD </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- personnel who annually fly on Eastern aircraft.'' The airline handled about $ 87 million worth of military travel business in fiscal 1987. The decision to extend <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s right to handle military business was made by the <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, a panel created in the aftermath of the December 1985 crash of a chartered Arrow Air DC-8 that left 248 soldiers dead. Eastern was told April 11 that suspension proceedings were being started. Officials of the airline met with the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on April 25 and convinced the service they were addressing the problems, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carrier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, said today. `` They went out of their way to address these as serious concerns,'' <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON> told a reporter. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> ended up extending <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s right to carry military passengers but also decided to continue in-flight survey observations, he said. `` The book is still open,'' <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> survey team expressed concern about pilot turnover, poor morale among both air crew and maintenance personnel, antagonism between management and employees and the level of manning for certain operations. The military inspectors also questioned whether <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> was doing enough to audit and oversee contractors providing maintenance service, <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON> said. Eastern is a unit of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> that is locked in bitter dispute with employee unions. Last month, the airline was the focus of an unusally broad safety investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> that involved inspections of all of its airplanes. Corporate officers of Eastern maintain most of the complaints about airline operation can be traced to disaffected union workers and that the carrier is not scrimping when it comes to safety. `` They -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- did have some questions concerning airline safety and maintenance,'' said <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Musto </PERSON>, an Eastern spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` But we reviewed everything with them and we think we satisfied their questions. We welcome any inspections, observations or whatever.''

But the resignation is `` wholly unrelated to the controversy of today,'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s letter said in a reference to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s legal troubles and a recent series of departures by key aides at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> wrote a letter back to <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> thanking him for `` your loyalty, support and special vote of confidence.'' `` Some will be tempted to characterize my resignation in ways that suit their purposes,'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said in his letter. But he said that `` I hasten to stress that in leaving the Department, I am carrying through with plans formed in a calmer time and based on a host of personal and professional considerations.'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said he had long planned to leave the department this summer to enter private law practice. While the head of the legal counsel's office has remained loyal to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources said <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> had serious doubts about remaining at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> two months ago, following the abrupt resignations of Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and criminal division chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s announcement comes several weeks before independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> is to issue a report on his year-old criminal investigation of the attorney general which is expected to raise questions about <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s ethical conduct. `` I am acutely aware ... that this is a time of controversy for you and for the Department, and thus is not the most opportune moment for members of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s leadership to be departing,'' said <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>. His letter praised <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> for promoting a strict interpretation of the Constitution, a restoration of authority to the states and the principle of nondiscrimination. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has criticized the courts for not adhering to the intent of the framers of the Constitution. He has argued in favor of federalism, a more equitable balance of power between the state and federal governments. The attorney general has constantly criticized racial quotas in hiring and promotion as well as the widespread use of affirmative action goals and timetables. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, who has been at the department almost seven years, is resigning at a time when polls show that a majority of the general public has an unfavorable view of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, whose involvement with scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has placed the attorney general under constant criticism for more than a year. A <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Post-ABC New Poll released Thursday found that 51 percent of those surveyed had an unfavorable impression of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, while only 9 percent had a favorable impression and 40 percent expressed no opinion. In addition, 38 percent said he should resign, while 9 percent said he should not. The poll surveyed 1,508 Americans by phone and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, who played a leading role in the unsuccessful efforts to win a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> seat for <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>, has been negotiating with several law firms for some time, said sources at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> is the latest <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official to announce his departure in an exodus which began March 29 with the protest resignations of <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> quit out of concern that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s refusal to resign was hurting the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s operations, morale and public image <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> recently traveled to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to participate in negotiations with Panamanian Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> was among a handful of political advisers chosen by <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to conduct a weekend inquiry in November 1986 into the administration's secret arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The inquiry uncovered the diversion of some of the arms sale proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels, triggering the Iran-Contra affair. There has been a complete turnover of personnel in key sections of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in the past two months. Five of <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>' deputies left following his resignation, virtually emptying the No. 2 office in the department, and two of <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>'s aides quit when he did. Last week, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s chief spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON> disclosed the attorney general had fired him for not defending him strenuously enough. The head of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s speechwriting unit resigned within hours of <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON>'s disclosure.

Officials allege <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> provided <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbst </PERSON>, also 33, with the bogus ticket and the two planned to split the winnings. Charges were leveled against the men May 3, less than a week after <PERSON> Herbst </PERSON> traded in the ticket for the first installment of the July 15, 1987, jackpot, $ 469,989. The two men appeared briefly in the chambers of District Justice <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Yanich </PERSON>. After the men waived the hearings, <PERSON> Yanich </PERSON> scheduled arraignments in <LOCATION> Dauphin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> for July 7. <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> remains free on a $ 50,000 bond. <PERSON> Herbst </PERSON> was returned to <LOCATION> Dauphin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail, although his bond has been reduced from $ 50,000 to $ 25,000, <PERSON> Yanich </PERSON> said. Authorities have charged <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> with two counts of theft, one count of conspiracy, one count of tampering with records, one count of forgery and one count of unlawful use of a computer. <PERSON> Herbst </PERSON> is charged with two theft counts, one conspiracy count and one forgery count. If convicted, <PERSON> Herbst </PERSON> would face up to 31 years in prison and $ 70,000 in fines. <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> would face 40 years in prison and up to $ 90,000 in fines. <PERSON> Herbst </PERSON> told lottery officials he had been using the ticket as a bookmark.

<HEAD>Physical Education Professionals Say Kids Need to Shape Up</HEAD>

 Schools should revamp physical education programs to help the nation's out-of-shape young people become fitter and learn to exercise regularly, a fitness expert said Friday. `` We've got an alarming problem with the deteriorating state of fitness in American kids,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haydon </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fitness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's no question that our kids are far more sedentary than 20 years ago. The Austin-based foundation _ which recently completed a fitness survey of 20,000 schoolchildren, primarily in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ presented its study at the American College of Sports Medicine annual convention. <PERSON> Haydon </PERSON>, former director of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Governor's <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fitness </ORGANIZATION>, said his group has developed a pilot program, called Fit Youth Today, to encourage young people to improve cardiovascular fitness through regular exercise. The program was tested last fall in 17 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> school districts. This spring, it is being used by a number of districts throughout the country, he said. Previous fitness programs simply tested students once annually through programs such as the one sponsored by the President's Physical Fitness Council But the FYT program includes an eight-week training program of running and calisthenics, followed by a four-part test. <PERSON> Haydon </PERSON> said that of the 20,000 students participating in last fall's study, 29 percent reached the program's fitness standards after the eight-week regimen. Part of the problem is that schools emphasize prowess at the expense of general fitness, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Squires </PERSON>, an associate professor of biology and physcial education at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seguin </LOCATION>. The researchers also said parents should take an active role in encouraging their children to pursue physical fitness. `` Parents check their kids' math homework, but how many parents actually pay attention to the fitness levels of their kids?'' <PERSON> Squires </PERSON> asked.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s civil rights chief leveled a scathing attack against <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for exempting itself from civil rights laws and denied that he lied to senators last year about a <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> voter challenge case involving the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is almost laughable to sit here and listen to these grand protestations by members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about this administration's civil rights record,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday Referring to frequent complaints from liberals that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is trying to turn back the clock on civil rights, <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said, `` This chamber has not seen fit in over 200 years to reach out and even once wind the civil rights clock that watches in forced silence over its activities.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has exempted itself from a myriad of civil rights laws dealing with discrimination in employment and other areas. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members did not respond directly to <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>' comments, but Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., strongly criticized <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> for adopting a confrontational approach to dealing with civil rights issues <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> cited a Feb. 22 memo circulated in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in which <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said that `` we must polarize the debate'' in the waning months of the administration on issues ranging from AIDS to capital punishment to prison conditions. `` When it comes to civil rights under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> is the name and polarization is the game,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. When Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., questioned whether polarizing the debate was `` prudent,'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> replied that `` I stole a page from your own book'' and said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had been confrontational as well <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> is counselor to Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> as well as assistant attorney general in charge of the civil rights division. Another judiciary committee member, Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, accused <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> of lying last year and of rejecting subordinates' advice to launch an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation into a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> voter registration challenge in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> disclosed memos by <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>' civil rights division subordinates urging that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> look into possible criminal violations of the Voting Rights Act in connection with a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> voter registration challenge aimed at predominantly black precincts in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> in 1986. One memo to <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION>, dated Oct. 7, 1986, from an attorney in the voting section, <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertz </PERSON>, said that if the voter registration challenge were to be found to be a conspiracy to disenfranchise black voters, that would be a criminal violation of the Voting Rights Act. She noted that it is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison to deprive anybody of a right under the voting act. In March 1987, <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> told the committee that it was the conclusion of `` everybody who looked at the matter'' from the division's voting section that `` there was no ... violation of the Voting Rights Act that would allow us to go in and prosecute.'' `` You misstated the facts; you lied to the committee,'' <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> told <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, who responded that <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> was stating `` half-truths.'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said that another part of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the criminal division, was consulted on the matter and concluded that no criminal investigation was warranted. However, after the hearing, one of <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION>' deputies, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, said that the criminal division reviewed whether blacks were fraudulently registered, but did not review whether the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s challenge to the voters might have violated the law. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> and <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> insisted that subordinates in the civil rights division ended up agreeing that no <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> probe was needed. Since the case involved the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, `` I wanted to be darn sure I was n't going to do something they would question us about later,'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said. After the hearing, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said that the decision not to launch an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> probe before the election was made out of concern that the existence of an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation might influence the outcome of the election.

 Riot police kicked and clubbed anti-government protesters Friday and fired tear gas grenades after President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> ordered that all measures be taken to crush violent demonstrations. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, presiding over a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said the dissident protests threaten the safety of the Olympic Games, which begin Sept. 17 in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. As part of tightened security preceding the Games, a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister ordered police to maintain surveillance on foreigners spending long periods of time in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> without a definite purpose. In downtown <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, angry passers-by shouted `` Shame!'' as some of an estimated 7,000 riot police fired tear gas and repeatedly charged about 3,000 radical students. Police chased protesters into subways and tossed tear gas grenades at passers-by who protested. Several officers lifted a protesting businessman in a blue suit above their heads and carried him away. Police broke up an attempted sit-in at City Hall and an attempt by about 500 students to march toward the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> library. They arrested dozens of students, beating and kicking many of the protesters and hitting them with clubs as they were dragged away. There were no reports of injuries, and police did not give an overall arrest figure. Some students hurled firebombs and rocks at police, but most just chanted anti-government and anti-U.S. slogans. `` Down with the military dictatorship!'' `` Punish <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo!'' and `` Drive out the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>!'' they yelled. Radical students claim the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supports military rule in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and enforces partition of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, divided since 1945. The protesters demand the expulsion of the 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Protesters have attacked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic buildings during the protests, including the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. No Americans have been hurt. Protesters have also demanded that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> serve as co-hosts of the Olympics as a move toward reunification of the two countries. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> called the radicals a threat to the safety of the Games and said, `` It is imperative that all possible measures be taken to forestall acts of violence by domestic radical groups.'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> also warned that <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> `` may stage any kind of adventure and provocation to mar the success of the Games.'' Home Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Choon-koo </PERSON>, who is in charge of the nation's 135,000 police, ordered the watch on certain foreigners to prevent infiltration by terrorists at the Olympics The government inaugurated a 13,000-member police <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> to guard Olympic athletes and facilities. Members were selected for martial arts and foreign language skills. Police also distributed 5,000 leaflets nationwide with portraits of seven people suspected in the hijacking in 1970 of a Japanese jetliner to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> by the terrorist <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> group. One person suspected in the hijacking, <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Shibata </PERSON>, 34, was arrested in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> after returning from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on a false passport, police said. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, a police spokesman said officers were questioning <PERSON> Shibata </PERSON> to try to determine if the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> planned any renewed terrorist action. In the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, about 5,000 people marched peacefully to mark the anniversary of the end of a 1980 anti-government uprising in which at least 191 people died. A memorial service was held in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, about 165 miles south of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Afterward, marchers, with a coffin bearing pictures of the dead, walked through the city. Radicals claim <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, an army general at the time, helped direct the police action.

 A jury has been selected for former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s trial on charges of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan. Eight jurors and four alternates seated Thursday were sworn in today in <ORGANIZATION> Maricopa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Opening statements are set for Thursday, one day after the defense will ask the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to send the charges back to a grand jury for reconsideration. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s lawyers contend prosecutors misused the grand jury process in seeking the indictment. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, 63, is charged with six felony counts of perjury, willful concealment and filing false documents and faces up to 22 years in prison if convicted on all counts. His brother and 1986 campaign treasurer, <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, faces three similar counts and up to 9 -LCB- years in prison. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, a Republican, was removed from office April 4 when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convicted him of two unrelated impeachment charges. He also was impeached for failing to disclose the $ 350,000 loan from <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON>, but the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> did not hear that charge for fear of prejudicing his criminal trial. The jurors were chosen from a pool of 99 who filled out long questionnaires aimed at ferreting out bias. Thirty-seven of them were questioned in court this week to create the 24-member pool from which the jury was selected.

 By shuffling the summit schedule and questioning delegations set to meet with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is sending an unmistakeable signal that he intends to seize the initiative during the pair's <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> face-off. The challenge facing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as he awaits the start of the summit Sunday is to maintain his well-rehearsed game plan _ or to alter it to compete with the Soviet leader. The Soviets already have scrambled the schedule for the talks opening Monday and apparently imposed restraints on some of the people who hoped to meet with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. One of two summit sessions scheduled for Monday was scrubbed, although the time allotted for the two leaders to meet _ 6 hours _ was maintained. The Soviets gave no specific explanation, saying an `` internal function'' required the cancellation. The White House, puzzled at first, decided to describe the decision as `` mutual'' and not make a fuss. Moreover, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will take the unprecedented step of holding a news conference next Wednesday, the day before the summit ends, according to an official Soviet source who spoke only on condition he not be identified. Never before has a general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> met formally with reporters on home territory, the source said. Meanwhile, a <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> `` refusenik,'' <PERSON> Roald </PERSON> <PERSON> Zelichenok </PERSON>, said in a telephone interview that <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> secret police had warned him against accepting an invitation to meet <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Monday. The Jewish dissident, who has been refused permission to emigrate to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for more than 10 years, said he was told `` in light of security measures'' around <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, he would not be permitted to leave <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>. There were reports, too, that some of the church officials due to meet <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at the <PERSON> Danilov </PERSON> monastery also were being kept away. The White House said Thursday that everyone invited to attend both gatherings would be there. And in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, officials showed no concern over the meetings and sought to minimize their impact. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> said `` the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> President ... is certainly free to decide who of Soviet citizens he finds interesting and useful to meet with outside the framework of the official events.'' But, he added, `` this American move is hardly aimed at improving mutual understanding between the <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION>'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has arranged for <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the White House chief of staff, to make a flight to <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> with the text of the treaty the two leaders signed last December in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to abolish land-based nuclear ballistic and cruise missiles in the range of 300 to 3,4000 miles. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is in the final stages of ratifying the pact. If the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> acts in time, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> on Saturday will bring the instruments of ratification with him to <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>. They will be presented in ceremonial exchange with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> intends to use the occasion to extol the agreement _ his only dent in the nuclear arms race in 7 -LCB- years in office. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> clearly has another agenda in mind for the summit, one that does not focus on human rights _ or even arms control. With negotiations stymied on a bigger treaty to reduce long-range nuclear weapons, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is looking elsewhere to give the summit some substance. His sights are focused on regional hotspots, and he has begun to make his moves. The first, of course, was completing an agreement in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to withdraw the Soviet troops that have occupied <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> since 1979. The second was the word passed by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, a Soviet ally, that it would withdraw 50,000 soldiers from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s third move, which could come at the summit or directly afterward, is the prospective withdrawal of 50,000 to 100,000 Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. These bold initiatives are bound to win <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> points for peace around the world. And they could put <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on the defensive in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Two years ago, at the <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> summit, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was forced to respond to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s arms control initiatives. This time, the president may have to adjust his script to the Soviet leader's oneupsmanship on the ground.

 A woman who apparently set up housekeeping in <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'s house while he was out of town and took his sports car for a spin has been re-arrested after returning to his home, authorities said today. A woman identified variously as <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> or <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, 36, of no known address, was charged with burglary Thursday night, police said. The arrest came a day after she was released by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> authorities because <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> said he did n't want her prosected. Authorities said the woman initially identified herself as <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, but then said she referred to herself as <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaan </LOCATION> police said today they had documentation that the woman's name is <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>. <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>, host of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Late Night with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>,'' was not home at the time Thursday, police said. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> was jailed on $ 15,000 bail, said police Capt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Angelastro </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> was first arrested Sunday at the Lincoln Tunnel on a charge of receiving stolen property as she was driving into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> with a 3-year-old passenger. She did n't have the $ 3 toll, authorities said. `` I'm Mrs. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> and this is <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> was reported by authorities to have told the toll collector. `` Do n't you think <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> is good for the toll?

<TEXT>
 State-paid lawyers for <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s death row inmates say they can no longer defend their clients because they are out of money and have asked the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to halt all executions or have counties pay up. Five men are scheduled for execution between June 22 and July 8, but their lawyers do n't have money to travel to hearings or summon expert witnesses, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Spalding </PERSON>, director of the Office of Capital Collateral Representative, said Thursday. He accused Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> of signing death warrants on `` sheer whim'' to keep the pressure on defense lawyers. <PERSON> Spalding </PERSON> blamed his money woes on an unprecedented number of pending death warrants and being forced to move his office to more expensive quarters when the <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> municipal government took over its former building. <PERSON> Spalding </PERSON> on Thursday asked <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s high court to halt all executions or order counties where the convicts were sentenced to pay their legal costs. The court scheduled oral arguments on the request for June 7. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> has signed 20 warrants since the beginning of the year, almost as many as in all of 1987. Only one execution, however, has been carried out so far this year, that of <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasper </PERSON> <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> on March 15. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Spicola </PERSON>, the governor's general counsel, responded that <PERSON> Spalding </PERSON>'s inability to handle his agency's budget is a perfect example of why <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> has ordered a criminal investigation of the office. The governor earlier this year directed the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> to examine the agency's handling of funds and allegations that witnesses used by the its lawyers may have committed perjury. <PERSON> Spicola </PERSON> said he can not understand <PERSON> Spalding </PERSON>'s budget problems because his budget was increased from $ 800,000 in the last budget year to $ 1.4 million for the year ending June 30.

<HEAD>Unsolicited Donations Pour in To Repair Vandalism to Vietnam
Memorial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than $ 60,000 has been raised to repair scratches made by vandals on the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veterans Memorial, thanks to the efforts of veterans organizations and radio stations nationwide, a fund-raising official said Friday. `` People have been exceedingly generous,'' <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Scruggs </PERSON>, founder and president of the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veterans Memorial Fund, said. <PERSON> Scruggs </PERSON>, whose struggle to get the memorial built will be portrayed Sunday in the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> movie `` To Heal A Nation,'' said he was surprised that so many people were interested in contributing money to repair the memorial, which has become the most heavily visited monument in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> since it was dedicated six years ago. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> on May 2 said it had discovered 8-inch scratches, including one resembling a swastika, on two of the memorial's 140 polished granite panels. Scratches also were found later on a third panel on the 493-foot wall, which contains the names of those killed in the Southeast Asian war. <PERSON> Scruggs </PERSON> said neither the fund nor the Park Service solicited contributions. Instead, the money, which he called `` gratifying,'' was raised by groups and individuals who decided on their own to make donations following news accounts of the vandalism _ the first ever reported at the memorial. A <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> granite expert has been studying ways to remove the scratches from the polished granite, <PERSON> Scruggs </PERSON> said. The cost of repairs was not yet known. In the meantime, a stone expert has been hired to make temporary repairs by filling the scratch marks with synthetic resin that matches the mirror-like surface of the panels, according to <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Earle </PERSON> <PERSON> Kittleman </PERSON>. `` After the repairs are made, we will use the extra money to buy more granite so we will have panels ready to make replacements if the need arises,'' <PERSON> Scruggs </PERSON> said. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the veterans fund still are hoping to find out who vandalized the memorial. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Park Police have been patrolling around the clock since the damage was revealed, <PERSON> Kittleman </PERSON> said. On Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the fund will hold their traditional Memorial Day ceremony at the memorial, with speeches military music and a wreath laying.

 Dogs will keep their tails and chickens may fly the coop under a law passed Friday to improve the lives of domestic animals. The <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> said the law, drafted by the governing <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, would allow animals `` to behave naturally.'' The bill, which takes effect July 1, mandates a minimum living space for chikens, fur animals and pigs. It also says calves should stay with their mothers for not less than two months before being sold. The bill was prompted by an animal rights campaign led by <PERSON> Astrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON>, the author of children's books who created the character <PERSON> Pippi </PERSON> <PERSON> Longstocking </PERSON>. Within 10 years, farmers will have to release chickens from cages and allow them to roam outside. The law makes <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> the second country in the world after <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, to ban the cropping of dogs' tails for cosmetic reasons. A parliamentary committee also asked the government to oversee the labeling of cosmetics so that products tested on animals are marked as such. It said moves should be taken to ban such testing. Parliament rejected language that would make it illegal to keep cows in stalls all year but said farmers must give the animals a chance to go outside during the summer. The bill also calls for the licensing of riding schools and farms for fur animals.

<HEAD>92 Percent Of Kindergartners Pass First-Grade Readiness Test</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Results of a controversial first-grade readiness test administered to 90,434 <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> kindergartners last month show that 92 percent passed, education officials said Friday. The test, criticized by some as being too stressful for 5-year-olds and 6-year-olds, is required under the Quality Basic Education Act, enacted in 1985. This year, for the first time, passing the test is generally a prerequisite for entering the first grade. The rules give districts the opportunity to make exceptions for children who fail if the teacher believes they should be promoted. `` The passing rate on this test is pretty much what we anticipated,'' said <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernknopf </PERSON>, director of assessment for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. State officials had estimated that 90 percent would pass the test. The test instrument was the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Achievement Test. Possible scores ranged from 187 to 602, with the pass-fail cutoff set at 443 and the average for <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> students at about 532. State School Superintendent <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> kindergartners scored above the national average in all three areas of the test, with 79 percent exceeding the national average for math, 75 percent for visual recognition and 73 percent in sound recognition. Children are asked such things as to count the number of items in a picture and tell what item in a picture does n't fit in with the others. While 7,396 students did not meet the cutoff score, that does n't necessarily mean they wo n't be promoted to first grade, <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said If a child's teacher believes he or she is ready for first-grade work but the test score falls below the cutoff point, the child will be reassessed, he said. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> is the only state to administer a paper-and-pencil test to kindergartners as a condition for promotion, and some early childhood experts have argued that standardized tests are too stressful for young children. But <PERSON> Bernknopf </PERSON> said that he `` never thought it was stressful at all.'' `` When kids are taking a test and they know it's for real, they do a little better,'' he said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON>, director of guidance counseling and testing for <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, said the test may not be a good diagnostic tool if so many pupils earned a passing score. `` I'd like to have all them pass, but the nature of testing is, if it is valid ..., there would be a higher percent not passing,'' he said.

 Two bombs exploded in a park Friday in an attempt by Sinhalese nationalists to assassinate Prime Minister <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> and two other government officials, police said. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> and the other ministers were not hurt in the blast, said <PERSON> Gamini </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunewardene </PERSON>, deputy inspector general of police. The bombs detonated prematurely about 200 yards from where the men were chairing an outdoor public meeting, he said. Police found a third bomb and defused it, <PERSON> Gunewardene </PERSON> said. `` It was a clear attempt to assassinate the ministers,'' <PERSON> Gunewardene </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone from the town of <LOCATION> Muwara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eliya </LOCATION>, where the explosions occured. <PERSON> Muwara </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliya </PERSON> is in central <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, about 55 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. The officials had gone there to campaign for next Thursday's provincial elections It was n't known how many people were at the meeting. Police said it was `` well attended.'' <PERSON> Gunewardene </PERSON> said two critically injured Sinhalese men were found at the bomb site. The men were believed to be carrying the bombs toward the meeting when they went off. <PERSON> Gunewardene </PERSON> said the injured men were being treated and would be interrogated later. Both were believed to belong to the nationalist <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gunewardene </PERSON> said. The front is opposed to the peace accord signed last July to end the nearly five-year Tamil separatist war in the north and east of the island. The front has been blamed for the deaths of more than 290 politicians and government workers since the agreement was signed July 29 by President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> and Indian Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. Many members of the island's majority Sinhalese community contend that the pact makes too many concessions to the minority Tamils. The other ministers at the meeting were Lands Minister <PERSON> Gamini </PERSON> <PERSON> Dissanayake </PERSON> and Rural Industries Minister <PERSON> Sayuramoorthy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thondaman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dissanayake </PERSON> has been mentioned as a possible successor to <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>. The prime minister's office in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> refused to comment on the incident. In <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, police arrested a Sinhalese man after he was found carrying a long knife on a visit to a minister's home. The man, who was not identified by name, was arrested when he tried to meet Transport and Moslem Affairs Minister M.H. <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> at his <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> residence. Sinhalese, who are Buddhists, account for 75 percent of the island's 16 million population. Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, make up 18 percent. They claim they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who control the government and the army. The accord has failed to bring peace because the most powerful of the Tamil separatist groups, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, has rejected it. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, which has a large Tamil population of its own, has sent more than 50,000 troops to the island to try to put down the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>' rebellion.

<HEAD>`Don't Drink the Water,' Schools Tell Students</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Students in a rural <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> school district and in eight <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> schools were told, `` Do n't drink the water,'' after potentially hazardous matter was found in their drinking supplies. The order to stop using the water at <LOCATION> Snow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> School </LOCATION>, about 40 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, came Thursday on the last day of class. The <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, which tested the water earlier this month, found that its coliform bacteria count was more than 25 times the level considered potentially dangerous. Coliform bacteria are normally found in animals' colon; in water supplies, they indicate contamination by fecal matter. Continued high exposure to the bacteria make a person more susceptible to digestive disorders, said <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the environmental agency. In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, the problem was excessive amounts of lead, discovered in the water supplies of eight public schools in a television station's survey. The report prompted testing at all city schools over the Memorial Day weekend, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stobierski </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. `` These schools that have high levels of lead or those that we do n't have results for will be on bottled water when schools reopen on Tuesday, after the holiday,'' <PERSON> Stobierski </PERSON> said. The drinking water at <ORGANIZATION> Snow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> was `` as bad as you can get,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Power </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> ADEM </ORGANIZATION>'s public water supply branch. `` It's like drinking untreated water from a creek or river.'' <PERSON> Power </PERSON> said samples taken by his agency May 16 showed the water to be contaminated at more than 25 times the potentially dangerous level of coliform bacteria. School systems in the state are supposed to test their water monthly and report bacterial levels to the state, and the agency stepped in when it failed to receive the reports from the district. He said students at Snow Hill have been drinking well water contaminated at more than seven times the danger level since January, when the school reopened after being shut for 15 years. The 347 students were switched to Snow Hill from a school in <LOCATION> Pine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> after state officials ordered the county not to use the <LOCATION> Pine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> school, which was plagued by leakage of raw sewage and other problems. A fire destroyed the main campus building at <LOCATION> Pine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> last fall. <PERSON> Power </PERSON> said stomach aches, viruses or other illness contracted by students since January possibly could have been caused by the drinking water. The district's superintendent, <PERSON> Odell </PERSON> <PERSON> Tumblin </PERSON>, said she does not believe the problem is as serious as <ORGANIZATION> ADEM </ORGANIZATION> indicates. `` That water is clear and pure and a lot of families in the area have been using the same well for years,'' she said. `` I do n't see how the water system got poisoned just because the students got there.'' A new high school is being built in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, but school officials plan to use <LOCATION> Snow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> at least another year. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s WNEV-TV had water samples from 24 elementary schools analyzed and discovered that 10, including two private schools, had lead levels exceeding federal standards. <PERSON> Stobierski </PERSON> said the tainted water was unlikely to cause acute lead poisoning, but said scientists still do n't fully understand the chronic effects of low-level lead poisoning.

 An adviser to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said Friday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is violating a peace accord by continuing to ship arms to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s anti-communist <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas. `` They are arming, quite openly, those who want to go on in their civil war,'' said <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Primakov </PERSON>, who has advised <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on arranging the Soviet troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Primakov </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economy </ORGANIZATION> and International Relations, did not specify when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sent its most recent arms shipment to the Mujahedeen. No did he say whether continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shipments might halt withdrawal of the estimated 105,500 Soviet troops who are still in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` This means that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will jeopardize the situation,'' <PERSON> Primakov </PERSON> told a news conference for reporters covering next week's summit talks between <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` It means they will push <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> into a corner,'' he said. `` It destroys the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords.'' -LRB- In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Justesen </PERSON> said in response to <PERSON> Primakov </PERSON>'s charges: -LRB- `` The turnover of large amounts of military supplies constitutes a continuation of military aid. The Soviets should take their military equipment out with them. We will watch Soviet actions in this area carefully and will follow symmetry in making our decisions.'' Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON>, chief of staff of the Soviet armed forces, told reporters Thursday that 9,500 of his troops have left <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> since the pullout began May 15. Under the peace accord, the Soviet withdrawal is supposed to be completed by early 1989. <PERSON> Primakov </PERSON>'s charge appeared to be part of a pattern of protests aimed at pressuring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to stop aiding the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION>. On Thursday, the Afghan government lodged its fourth protest with a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer mission, accusing <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of continuing to channel arms to the guerrillas. The guerrillas have said they will continue to fight the Soviet-backed government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and will ignore the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords signed by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agreed to act as guarantors of the agreement. In an exchange of letters, each side agreed to stop arming its allies in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> if the other followed suit. The letters, which have not been made public, also are reported to have specified that if either side continued to arm its Afghan ally, the other would provide a commensurate level of weapons to its side. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has halted its arms shipments, Western diplomats say, but is leaving Soviet military bases and massive arms supplies to the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government as its forces pull out. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been supplying the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> with an estimated $ 500 million annually in arms and military supplies channeled through <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. About 2.5 million Afghans have fled to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> since the Soviets invaded <LOCATION> Afganistan </LOCATION> in December 1979, and the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> operate out of basis on Pakistani soil. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> also have supplied arms to the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> but have not signed the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords. An additional 1.5 million Afghan refugees are living in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which is supporting Islamic fundamentalist guerrilla groups.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Divided On Reimposing Martial Law</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Old-guard lawmakers from the governing <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> called for the return of martial law Friday after violent protests that injured hundreds of people, but their younger colleagues denounced the idea. Martial law was lifted in July after 38 years in force. Last Friday and Saturday, riot police and demonstrators battled in <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> for 18 hours, and there has been talk the government might bring back martial law. More than 200 people reportedly were injured and 96 protesters were detained in the riots, which broke out after a farmers' rights demonstration. The violence was the worst on this island since 1947, when native Taiwanese staged an uprising against <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> forces who had arrived from the Chinese mainland. A group of 75 legislators issued a statement calling the recent rioting `` a bloody incident unprecedented in 40 years.'' They urged the government to partially reimpose martial law because the nation had reached `` the moment of life and death.'' The statement said violent protests threatened national security and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s economic development. Most members of the Legislative Yuan who signed the statement were elected on mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> shortly before 1949, when they and the rest of the Nationalist government fled to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> after losing a civil war to the Communists. The Nationalist government claims to be the rightful ruler of all <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. A group of 27 lawmakers comprised mostly of Nationalist legislators elected in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> issued a statement opposed to a return to martial law and said it would drive `` the vehicle of democracy backward.'' The rioting was a temporary disorder and the government should not easily give up its achievement in democracy, the statement said. Since the lifting of martial law, under which demonstrations were banned, protests have been held almost daily by dissidents and other groups pressing a wide variety of political and economic demands. Newspapers reported Thursday that members of the party's policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> held heated discussions at a weekly meeting Wednesday about whether the government should reimpose martial law <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> police, meanwhile, turned down an application by a farmer's group to march in <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> on Tuesday, claiming the organization violated demonstration laws during previous protests. <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> <PERSON> Feng-hsi </PERSON>, spokesman of the group, said the farmers wanted to march to apologize to <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> residents for last week's violent protest. Also Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> announced that three sons of the late President <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-kuo </PERSON> were elected delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> congress this summer. <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON>, who died in January, was the son of <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON>, who led the Nationalists to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> in 1949. He was the main architect of the recent policies of easing the Nationalists' authoritarian grip on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and allowing unofficial contacts with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A 300-mile carpet of algae along the southern coast of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> has killed tons of salmon and rainbow trout, a <LOCATION> Norweigan </LOCATION> newspaper reported Friday. The single-cell algae has killed all marine life down to a depth of 26 feet in some parts of <LOCATION> Skagerrak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> between <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> Kattegat </LOCATION> belt between <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> daily Aftenposten said. <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, alarmed by weather reports showing the algae could be blown to its shores, dispatched a research boat Friday to track the growth. `` I've never experienced anything like it. The situation is highly dramatic,'' <PERSON> Arne </PERSON> <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON>, head of the Sea Pollution Laboratory of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday. <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> blamed nitrates and phosphorus washed into the sea from farms. Authorities say the algae is not harmful to humans, but it turns to slime on the gills of fish and chokes them to death. The algae growth extends about 310 miles along the southwest coast of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Goteborg </LOCATION> to the oil center of <LOCATION> Stavanger </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. Wild fish such as herring and flounder have not been as hard hit as the trout and salmon grown by Norwegian farmers in seaside pens, experts said. Those farmers have been advised by marine biologists to slaughter their fish. Some major fish farms in western <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> have started to tow their nets away from coastal areas into <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s deep, cool fiords to avoid the algae threat. Marine biologist <PERSON> Einar </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON> said it could take weeks or months for the algae to disappear, according to the newspaper. He said the algae has always been present in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> but never in such quantities.

<TEXT>
 A 31-year veteran undercover officer whose testimony helped convict an officer of the scandal-ridden 77th Precinct has been arrested on drug charges, authorities said. Detective <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Poulson </PERSON>, 56, of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, who had spent the last 13 years in the Internal Affairs Division investigating corrupt cops, was himself arrested by IAD investigators Thursday, IAD Chief <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. `` He was a very dedicated and good performer,'' the chief said. `` I'm shocked and saddened that he would give up his 30 years of police service and his pension for this brief encounter.'' In 1987, <PERSON> Poulson </PERSON> had posed as a cocaine dealer during an investigation of police corruption at the 77th Precinct, which resulted in the indictment of 13 officers. Videotapes of <PERSON> Poulson </PERSON> offering an officer a $ 500 payoff for protection helped convict the officer. A unidentified woman arrested in April on drug charges told narcotics officers <PERSON> Poulson </PERSON> had introduced her to drugs four years ago, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. The woman contacted <PERSON> Poulson </PERSON> and he agreed to meet her Thursday night at a house police had wired for sound. Investigators said <PERSON> Poulson </PERSON> possessed slightly less than an eighth of an ounce of cocaine that he was going to give to the woman. `` There were indications he had been using drugs recently,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. The detective refused to take a drug test on the advice of his attorney. There were no indications that <PERSON> Poulson </PERSON> had been dealing cocaine, or that he had obtained the narcotic from police seizures, the chief added. <PERSON> Poulson </PERSON> was charged with one count of drug possession and two counts of drug possession with intent to sell. The maximum penalty for the last two counts is a prison term of up to 25 years. <PERSON> Poulson </PERSON> earned about $ 50,000 a year. Under police regulations, he was eligible to retire with a pension worth two-thirds of his annual salary after 30 years.

<HEAD>Disposable Personal Incomes Down 0.9 Percent In April</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Americans' disposable personal incomes fell 0.9 percent in April, the steepest drop in a year, as tax payments took a big bite out of paychecks, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday. It was the first decline in disposable income since last November and the biggest setback since a 2.5 percent plunge in April 1987 when federal taxes took an even bigger chunk of Americans' incomes. Faced with higher tax bills, Americans balked at taking on any big purchases, leaving spending basically unchanged in April after a big 0.8 percent rise in March. Before adjusting for taxes, personal incomes edged up a tiny 0.1 percent in April after a giant 1.1 percent rise in March. Analysts said they were not unduly concerned about either the weak income growth or the lackluster spending in April, saying the month was influenced by a host of special factors. They noted that in addition to tax bills, spending was also depressed by the impact of an early Easter which meant consumers did their shopping in March, siphoning off sales that normally would have occurred last month. The income gain looked weaker because the March figure had been inflated by annual bonus payments made to workers at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plus a big jump in farm subsidy payments. Excluding those factors, incomes before taxes would have risen 0.6 percent in April and 0.3 percent in March. But economists said that the big drop in the important category of disposable income will have some effect in coming months. `` After the shock they got in April, I think people will adjust their withholding statements to have more taken out of their paychecks. That will be a slight damper on consumer spending,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagens </PERSON>, senior economist at the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, an economic forecasting firm. But analysts said they were not too concerned because of Thursday's reoport that the economy was far stronger in the first three months of the year than previously believed. The government revised its estimate of overall growth, as measured by the gross national product, up to a brisk 3.9 percent, compared to an original estimate of 2.3 percent GNP growth. <PERSON> Hagens </PERSON> said he now believed that growth for the year would come in at between 3.5 percent and 4 percent, up as much as a full percentage point from his original forecast. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economists </ORGANIZATION> released a new survey Friday which also boosted the growth estimate for the year to 2.9 percent, compared to a forecast a month ago of GNP growth of 2.2 percent. <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said the survey, taken in mid-May, would probably show even higher forecast now, based on the big revision to the GNP. The economy grew 2.9 percent in both 1987 and 1986. But still a majority of those polled, 57.4 percent, believed that a recession would begin in 1989, brought on by rising inflation and higher interest rates. `` We see inflation coming in at 5 percent and that will cause the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to tighten further and that will raise interest rates,'' she said. `` Higher interest rates are normally the way we get into recessions in this country.'' The big decline in disposable incomes in April pushed the savings rate down to 3.8 percent last month, compared to a rate of 4.7 percent in March. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report said personal tax payments climbed at an annual rate of $ 36.2 billion in April, compared to a March increase of $ 10.9 billion. But this was still down from a huge $ 85.5 billion surge in tax payments in April 1987, a year when many Americans ended up owing more because they had sold long-time investments at the end of 1986 to escape higher capital gains taxes under the new tax law. Wages and salaries rose at an annual rate of $ 7.9 billion in April, down from a March increase of $ 15 billion which had been inflated by special bonus payments made by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Farm income fell $ 7.6 billion last month compared to an increase of $ 19.4 billion in March, with federal subsidy payments accounting for the wide swing On the spending side, purchases of durable goods fell by $ 4.3 billion while purchases of non-durable goods dropped $ 14.1 billion. Purchases of services, which include housing costs, climbed $ 11.6 billion.

<HEAD>Woman Sentenced to 14 Years for Neglecting Her Frostbitten

 A woman was sentenced Friday to 14 years in prison by a judge who blamed cocaine and teen-age motherhood for the tragedy that resulted in her 9-year-old daughter losing her legs to frostbite when she was locked in an unheated apartment. Workers boarding up an abandoned, unheated <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> house Jan. 17 discovered <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON> alone and pleading for help from a barricaded apartment. Surgeons who amputated her legs below the knee said gangrene had set in four to five days before she was found. Her mother, <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Britt </PERSON>, 25, pleaded guilty May 6 to felony child neglect, over the objections of her attorney, in a plea agreement that dropped two other counts and avoided a trial in which her daughter would have had to testify against her. `` I think it's probable this would n't have happened but for cocaine,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maroc </PERSON>. Nevertheless, he said she appeared to love the child she had when she was 15. `` When we're talking about children having children and drugs being involved, is it any wonder these things happen?'' he said. Ms. <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> admitted to cocaine use and asked Maroc whether she would be sent to a drug rehabilitation center for treatment. He told her he would recommend that she receive counseling and treatment in prison. <PERSON> Maroc </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> had no criminal record, but he added four years to the standard 10-year term, citing the length of time the child was left in the freezing apartment and her permanent disability. Investigators said the girl had been in the apartment for nearly 10 days during a bitter cold spell of near-zero temperatures. During that time, Ms. <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> told school officials her daughter was missing classes because of a cut on her foot, <PERSON> Maroc </PERSON> said. The court accepted the plea bargain over the objections of defense attorney <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Toomey </PERSON>, who said prosecutors lacked sufficient evidence to show Ms. <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> intended to harm her daughter. He said Ms. <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> accepted the bargain because she feared receiving the maximum 20-year sentence if she were convicted by a jury. Under questioning by <PERSON> Maroc </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> repeated her willingness to accept the deal, saying, `` I do n't want to go to trial.'' She offered no explanation, but the Rev. <PERSON> Cozetta </PERSON> <PERSON> Olive </PERSON>, a minister who has counseled Ms. <PERSON> Britt </PERSON>, said she woman wanted to spare her daughter further trauma. Child welfare authorities placed <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON> in the home of her paternal grandmother, <PERSON> Katie </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON> of <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>. `` Her physical recovery is superb,'' said Deputy Prosecutor <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Coulis </PERSON>. `` Her emotional recovery will be much longer, perhaps for life.''

 Former President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> says a proposed fifth Reagan-Gorbachev summit after the Democratic and Republican conventions this summer would be meaningless unless both parties' presidential candidates also agree to attend Such a meeting, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said, `` would be a ludicrous three-ring circus.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> held out the possibility of yet another summit before he departed Wednesday for summit talks with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> next week. The German newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as saying the Soviets are interested in concluding a Strategic Arms Reduction Talks or START treaty with him, rather than waiting until his successor takes over in January. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said that with only five months remaining before the Nov. 8 presidential election, too little time remains for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to complete an arms control agreement that would be in the national interest. `` Once the two major parties choose their tickets for the general election, an incumbent's authority _ in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> eyes _ drops to nil,'' he said. `` Any summit after the two conventions will be meaningless unless both the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and Democratic nominees agreed to attend. In the unlikely event that they did, it would be a ludicrous three-ring circus.'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s views are contained in a column he wrote for this weekend's editions of the Sunday Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. A copy was obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, who had three summit meetings with Soviet leaders while he was president, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> does n't have enough time left as president to resolve several important Soviet-American issues. Among them, he said, are the relationship between defensive and offensive weapons systems, whether to allow mobile strategic missiles, and verification of cruise and mobile missiles. Therefore, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> should concentrate in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on conventional arms control and regional political conflicts. Trying to rush the START talks toward settlement `` would put the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the intolerable position of negotiating against a deadline in questions that directly affect our survival,'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said. Even signing a draft agreement would be a mistake, he said. `` That would lock the next administration into an approach that focused excessively on cuts in the number of nuclear weapons instead of the critical issue: the stability of the strategic balance,'' he wrote. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said the centerpiece of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> approach should be conventional arms control in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and not any goal of making equal cutbacks in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` While American forces would retreat to the other side of an ocean, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s forces would simply take a short train ride to the western border of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` Instead, we should seek asymetrical reductions in the Kremlin's armies.'' The former president said progress on U.S.-Soviet economic cooperation must be linked to resolving regional disputes in which <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s actions threaten American interests, `` if we want <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to take our positions on these issues seriously.'' `` If we do not insist on linkage at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, we will end up subsidizing our own destruction,'' he said.

<HEAD>Radical Reforms Outlined, But Economic Change Unclear</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Communist Party has outlined a series of reforms that could sweep away many political and judicial remnants of Stalinism. But it has failed to say how it will transform the economy. The changes are sketched in a program that will be debated next month at a party conference considered crucial to the future of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. The document, published in Soviet newspapers Friday, was approved at a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting this week and stresses the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s need to modernize all aspects of society. It speaks of elections for some posts, of reducing some adminstrative powers of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, of limiting the terms of office and of democratic reforms. While the proposal makes no concessions to demands for a multi-party system, it says social organizations that are not limited to <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members should have `` a bigger say in the political process in future.'' The nation's laws will be reviewed, the document says, and `` We must firmly adhere to the following principle: Everything is permissible unless prohibited by the law.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has stressed reforms of the judicial and political system as crucial to ending the vestiges of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s dictatorship. But even if the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference approves all the changes, their implementation may be slowed by resistance in some quarters. Changes envisaged in the political system include a limit of two five-year terms for for party and government officials all the way up to the policy-setting <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the Supreme Soviet, the nation's parliament. The party also is ordered to keep hands off day-to-day management of the economy and government, and concentrate on setting goals. Almost all the proposed changes, called the `` theses'' for the party conference opening June 28, had been raised before by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> or his followers. But in an apparent victory for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the principle of secret ballot elections for some posts was adopted. The party leader also appears to have gained a chance to sweep opponents from positions of influence. The conference will consider calling for a review of all the party's 19 million members. The review is likely to focus on the clear struggle between orthodox Communists used to the authoritarian party system set up by <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and reformers who want to see <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms succeed. The theses contained strong criticism of what it said was the abuse of power under the system built up by <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, and of the political and economic stagnation that set in under <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, who was in power from 1964 to 1982. It declared the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was `` on the brink of an economic crisis'' after <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. Although progress has been made, the program said the economy still is far from the modern financial and monetary system <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> wants. An economist close to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aganbegyan </PERSON>, told reporters Friday that despite three years of reform efforts, most average Soviets have seen no improvement in their lives. He said a reform of prices, which is promised for the early 1990s, is essential. <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Shmelev </PERSON>, an economist known for his controversial proposals, said the Soviet economy suffers from gross inefficiency. It has a shortage of 20 million workers in some sectors, but 25 million extra workers in other sectors, he said. In apparent deference to growing grumbling among consumer about shortages, the theses also stressed that supplies of food and consumer goods must be sharply increased. Scientists and educators were castigated for not doing enough to introduce new technology and new thinking, but the biggest criticism was reserved for managers and bureaucrats who still want to boss others around. The only sector of the population praised for its contribution to the reform effort was the intelligentsia, who have proved the most vocal supporters of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. That reflects in part changes that have given Soviets more interesting newspapers, livelier television programs and some previously banned films, books and music. If the document is accepted by the 5,000 delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference, it will mark an important consolidation of reforms to date for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and give him the basis to go further in transforming the Stalinist system he inherited.

 Here are the main points of <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> proposals published in Friday's Soviet newspapers: _ On political pluralism The paper says `` a salient feature of our time is the appearance of a real pluralism of opinions, open comparison of ideas and interests.'' It does not envisage abandonment of the one-party system, but suggests that some social organizations outside the party should have a bigger say in the political process in future _ Local and regional legislatures and the national <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> are to play an enhanced role in political debate and to operate under legal guarantees that their decisions will not be undone by bureaucratic interference _ The legal system is to be strengthened, presuming the innocence of those on trial and radically reforming the operation of state prosecutors Soviet laws are to be rewritten and the principle adopted that `` everything is permissible unless prohibited by the law.'' _ Reforms should allow for the exercise of constitutional freedoms _ freedom of press, conscience, assembly, street demonstrations and `` firmer guarantees of personal rights, such as the inviolability of the person and the home, and privacy of correspondence and telephone conversations, to name but a few. _ Party and government officials should be limited to two five-year terms in office, with third terms permissible only by majority vote in secret ballot of party and government offices concerned The proposals say this practice should extend all the way to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and to the Supreme Soviet, or national parliament. _ Due attention should be paid to ethnic relations, and political institutions formed to articulate ethnic interests made `` more active. _ The party should be reformed to prevent a repeat of the abuses of power developed under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and `` those who in the past fell victim to unjustified political accusations and illegality'' should be rehabilitated

 <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, a top aide to Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, handed in his resignation Friday, but said his decision to join the exodus of officials from the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was `` wholly unrelated'' to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s legal troubles. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, the assistant attorney general who heads the office of legal counsel, said he is `` just now beginning'' to look for work with a private law firm. But he said his decision to leave was not based on the fact that independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> is expected to issue a report in several weeks raising questions about <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s ethical conduct. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, whose resignation is effective July 8, praised <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> as being `` almost exclusively responsible'' for advancing a number of issues on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's conservative agenda by focusing debate on interpreting the Constitution and the principles of federalism and non-discrimination. In an interview, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said he has `` an extraordinary admiration'' for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s `` ability to withstand the controversy that prevails at this time'' in connection with <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s year-old criminal invesgtigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said `` I have not formed any judgments'' about <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> on the matters <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> has been examining. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> thanked <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> in a letter for his `` loyalty, support and special vote of confidence.'' The independent counsel launched an investigation on May 11, 1987, that has focused on <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s ties to scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and a $ 1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline project. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> acknowledged he had doubts briefly about remaining at the department two months ago when the No. 2 department official, Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, and criminal division chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> resigned in protest over <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s continued tenure as attorney general. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said he at first thought <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> might know something about the `` circumstances surrounding <PERSON> Ed </PERSON>,'' such as a possible determination by <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had engaged in wrongdoing. But three days after <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> resigned, <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> announced he had insufficient evidence at that time to seek an indictment of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. In a letter to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said he long ago decided to leave this summer and that `` I am carrying through with plans formed in a calmer time and based on a host of personal and professional considerations wholly unrelated to the controversy of today.'' <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> said that in terms of staffing, the department `` is in better shape than most agencies around town at this point in an administration,'' with many officials returning to jobs in the private sector as the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration comes to an end. <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> said the department `` fully expects'' to have a replacement for <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> by the time he leaves. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, 36, took the legal counsel post in November 1985 after serving as deputy assistant attorney general in the department's civil rights division, where he worked closely with <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> played a leading role in trying to win a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> seat for federal Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> last year. But the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>, a vocal conservative, by a wide margin. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> recently traveled to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to participate in negotiations to try to remove Panamanian Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power. He also was among a handful of political advisers chosen by <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to conduct a weekend inquiry in November 1986 into the administration's secret arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The inquiry uncovered the diversion of some of the arms sale proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels, triggering the Iran-Contra scandal. There has been a complete turnover of personnel in key sections of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in the past two months. Five of <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>' deputies left following his resignation, virtually emptying the deputy's office, and two of <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>'s aides quit when he did Last week, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s chief spokesman, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON>, said the attorney general had fired him for not defending him strenuously enough. The head of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s speechwriting unit resigned within hours of <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON>'s disclosure. It took <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> nearly two months to find replacements for the posts vacated by <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>' successor, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> trial lawyer <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON>, will fill the slot on an acting basis, pending completion of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation process. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>'s replacement, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> <PERSON> S.G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, also will serve on an acting basis

<TEXT>
 A child whose fire-and-brimstone preaching has disrupted his school was suspended for a fifth time Friday as parents gave his father a petition asking him to stop the boy and his two younger children from preaching at school. The petition was signed by 474 parents and opponents of the street preaching by the Strode children _ <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON>, 10, Pepper, 6, and <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON>, 5. On Friday, <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> again ignored requests from <ORGANIZATION> Eastfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> Assistant Principal <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> to come into school and begin class. He was suspended for six days, until summer break begins. Pepper and <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> are to return to school Thursday. A group led by parent <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahan </PERSON> asked permission to present the petition to the boy's father, street preacher <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Strode </PERSON>, while he and <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> were receiving <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON>'s latest suspension papers. But school officials asked the group to make the presentation off school grounds. The elder Strode told the group they did n't know the gospel and were going hell. The parents responded that they do know the gospel and asked Strode to stop the preaching by his children. `` Something bad is going to happen to them,'' said <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> McPeters </PERSON>, one of the parents. `` I have no mercy on them. I do n't care what happens to them. Mrs. <PERSON> McPeters </PERSON> said the Strode children do n't understand what they're saying, but that they only repeat what they have been told at home. `` Sometimes they'll hold up their Bibles and holler ` the Bible says' and then forget what they're suppose to say,'' she said. `` They're not preachers, they're children.'' Strode said Friday that the family would be moving before school began in the fall and the children would enroll in <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION>, which is in a different district. But Mrs. <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> said she did not think the controversy would end because that school district has the same policy requiring students to enter the building at 7:30 a.m. School officials have repeatedly said the children are being suspended for violating that policy, not because they preach.

<HEAD>Grand Jury Refuses To Indict Officers In Shooting Of Man With Toy
Gun</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A grand jury refused to indict two police officers accused of shooting a former mental patient who had a toy pistol, but the officers and the toy manufacturer face a $ 25 million lawsuit. Police overreacted and the gun looked too real, claims the lawsuit filed by the victim, <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathieu </PERSON>, 36. City officials also are defendants in the lawsuit. <PERSON> Mathieu </PERSON> was paralyzed from the waist down by a police gunshot that cut his spinal cord on May 16, the suit said. An Orleans Parish grand jury Thursday found `` no evidence of wrongdoing'' and refused to indict the involved officers, whom police have not publicly identified. The shooting happened after police responded to a report that someone was looking into the windows of a nursing home. The officers came upon <PERSON> Mathieu </PERSON> sleeping under a tree near the home's parking lot `` As the police officers approached the sleeping Mr. <PERSON> Mathieu </PERSON>, a neighbor yelled, ` Do n't shoot him, he has n't got any sense!' The police officers then yelled at the sleeping Mr. <PERSON> Mathieu </PERSON> and he jumped up with his hands up in the air,'' the suit said. Police said on the day of the shooting that <PERSON> Mathieu </PERSON> pointed a gun at officers, but the suit does not address that issue. `` The police officers then hit the ground and opened fire on Mr. <PERSON> Mathieu </PERSON>,'' the suit says, adding that the officers kept firing after <PERSON> Mathieu </PERSON> hit the ground, hitting him 11 times. The suit, filed by attorney <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, said the toy pistol was designed to look real. `` The merchandising, advertising and selling of the plastic toy gun is based in large part on the work done by the <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in making the full scale model of the 9mm automatic pistol look like a real gun,'' <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> says in the suit. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, a vice president of Imperial disclaimed any liability. `` When the toy is used as a toy, there has never been a problem, and no problem is even foreseeable,'' said <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kort </PERSON>. The suit also alleges the policemen, named in the suit as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>, acted too hastily and should n't have shot <PERSON> Mathieu </PERSON> 11 times even if they felt threatened. The city public affairs office refused comment on the suit.

 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won the May sweeps by the highest margin for a May sweeps ever and by the second-highest margin for any sweeps, according to figures from the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> released by the network. There are four sweeps months a year during which local ratings are measured for use in negotiating advertising rates. The networks generally load schedules with special programming designed to help their affiliates. The May sweeps ratings showed an increase in network audience since May sweeps of last year, and a change in the trend shown by end-of-season ratings last month of a decline in network viewership this season compared to 1986-87. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won the sweeps with an average, prime-time rating of 14.9 and a 26 share. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> was second with a 12.0 and 21, and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> third with an 11.7 and 20 share. It was <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s 12th sweeps win in a row. The last time any network won by a larger margin was when <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> won in July 1984, according to <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. The networks had a total rating of 37.9 in May of 1987. In May of this year, their total was 38.6. The rating is a percentage of the nation's 88.6 million households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use. The highest-rated show of the May sweeps was the two-hour `` Magnum, P.I.'' finale on CBS. It had a 32.0 rating and 48 share. In second was <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s movie, `` <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>: The Case of the Lady in the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>,'' with a 22.6 rating and 35 share. The highest-rated series was `` A Different World'' on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, with a 22.0 rating and 38 share, barely ahead of `` The Cosby Show,'' which had a 21.9 rating and 40 share. The larger share for `` Cosby'' indicates fewer sets in use at the earlier time period. The highest-rated miniseries was <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Something Is Out There,'' with a 19.2 and 30 share. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Bourne Identity'' was second with 18.5 and 30.

 The Afghan government has pardoned a French photographer jailed after he was convicted of spying, state-owned radio announced Friday. A <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> diplomat said the Frenchman would be released within two or three days. Western sources said they expected an Italian journalist also to be released soon. The two are the only foreigners known to be held in <LOCATION> Aghanistan </LOCATION>. Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> quoted Afghan President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> as announcing the pardon of French photographer <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillo </PERSON>. The decision was taken in view of `` the old friendship between <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' the president was quoted as saying in the report monitored in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>. He said the move was made in light of an accord signed last month to withdraw Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> has made increased efforts to polish his international image since then. The radio broadcast said <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> made the announcement after <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Perol </PERSON>, secretary-general of the French External Affairs Ministry, visited <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. He delivered a personal message from <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, according to the radio station. Guillo was detained while filming the civil war in northern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and sentenced to 10 years in prison in September. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, his girlfriend, <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Lesieur </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that she had been informed by the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> that the journalist would be released Saturday morning. She said she did not know when he would return to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Fornier </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, said Friday that <PERSON> Guillo </PERSON> would be freed `` in the next two to three days.'' He said details of the release were still being worked out. <PERSON> Guillo </PERSON> has shared a prison cell in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> Fausto </PERSON> <PERSON> Biloslavo </PERSON>, who was serving a similar sentence. There was no official word Friday on whether the Italian would be released. However, Western diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they also expected <PERSON> Biloslavo </PERSON>'s freedom soon.

 A fund-raising effort to pay for a life-saving operation for <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>'s top-ranked police dog was called off almost as soon as it started Friday because of the overwhelming response, Sgt. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Dion </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dion </PERSON> said police stopped accepting contributions at 8 a.m. because the $ 1,000 raised was more than the $ 600 needed to rid Zeus of a cancerous tumor in his eye.

Officer <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendig </PERSON> said the city would not pay for 7-year-old Zeus' operation. Zeus is credited with 11 felony arrests and gained the nickname `` land shark'' because he once pulled a prowler out of some bushes.

<HEAD>Some Suburbanites Still Have Phone Trouble Despite New System</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A new system has been hooked up to restore service to half of <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>'s 35,000 west suburban customers whose telephones have been faulty since Mother's Day, but some said Friday that phone trouble persists. `` Mine does n't work,'' said <PERSON> Erva </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION> homeowner who was borrowing a neighbor's phone to try to get some answers about her telephone service problems. `` My son tried to make a long-distance call to <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and he could n't, so we're still having problems here,'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimner </PERSON>, also of <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and Zimner are two of the thousands of customers whose lines were reconnected to a state-of-the-art digital switching system at 11:59 p.m. Thursday, 2 -LCB- weeks after a fire ravaged the <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION> switching station. Since the blaze, thousands of customers have had periodic trouble completing calls to local numbers and have not been able to place calls outside their area code. Though half were reconnected late Thursday, others will continue to have spotty local service and trouble calling long distance until `` sometime in the beginning of June,'' when they're connected to the digital system, said <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Littel </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Littel </PERSON> said the company has received some complaints from reconnected customers Friday, but that problems with the new system should be `` isolated'' and can be fixed quickly. `` If they call today with trouble, it will be cleared up very soon after they call. It's just a matter of tweaking the system and finding out where the bug is,'' she said Friday. `` When you put a machine like this into action, usually we have weeks and weeks of testing to make sure it's running perfect and smooth. But because this was an emergency situation, we rushed the job,'' Ms. <PERSON> Littel </PERSON> said. `` We did things in reverse order: We did a little testing, turned the machine on, and now we're dealing with the trouble,'' she said. <PERSON> Zimner </PERSON>, who owns a delivery and messenger service, said, `` My business had been down -LRB- since the fire -RRB- because I could n't communicate with my clients. Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a retiree, said she was `` pretty disappointed'' when she picked up the phone Friday morning, and there was no dial tone. `` I'm much inconvenienced. I live by myself, so it's a bit of a concern,'' she said. `` I knew that they were supposed to switch over to a new machine, so I thought today everybody's phone was going to be OK _ but mine is n't,'' Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. Also Friday, Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> has indicated a willingness to assist local governments recover from the telephone crisis. The plan `` would probably include grants, purchase of emergency preparedness equipment or some other form of assistance,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> also said the Office of the State Fire Marshal is investigating the fire. If it is determined that the blaze was linked to an electrical storm that hit the area, businesses and local governments could possibly become eligible for federal aid.

<HEAD>Negotiator Says Peasants, Housewives Occupying Embassy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A government negotiator said Friday that masked invaders occupying the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> were not leftist guerrillas as a radio network reported, but workers, peasants, students and housewives. Another government spokesman said two leftist political parties agreed Friday to end a huge rural protest by peasants. A <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> communique said 16 people had been killed and 30 wounded in the past week in a guerrilla attack and several clashes between militant peasants and government security forces. The radio network <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION> reported soon after protesters rushed into the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday that leftist guerrillas had taken it over. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velazco </PERSON>, an assistant attorney general, met with representatives of the protesters for eight hours Friday and gave a different description of them to reporters. He said he was hopeful the sit-in would end peacefully. Sit-ins at embassies and consulates in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> are fairly common and seldom have anything to do with the country involved. The demands of this group include water for slum areas, which are being supplied only once a week during <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>'s worst drought in 53 years. A dozen sit-ins have occurred in the past four years, including two others at the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. All have ended with no one being hurt. Dozens of soldiers surrounded the two-story building in a residential area of northern <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. No guns were seen among the protesters, who appeared frequently at windows. Mexican diplomats and Colombian employees entered and left the building undisturbed. Spectators, including journalists, were kept a block away. About 40 people occupied the building. In addition to water for the slums, they want an investigation of allegations by leftist parties that the army sponsors death squads that have killed more than 800 leftists in three years. The military denies the allegation. Peasants who started marching on half a dozen towns last Monday also demand an investigation of the death squads. Only three marches continued Thursday _ in the northern states of <LOCATION> Santander </LOCATION>, <PERSON> North </PERSON> <PERSON> Santander </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Brito </PERSON>, assistant minister of government, said Friday the leftist political parties <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> had agreed to end them. He said the promise was made after government negotiators listened to peasant complaints. In addition to allegations about death squads, the peasants have said they want more effective land reform and nationalization of foreign oil companies. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, those killed in the past week included four policemen ambushed by guerrillas near <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, headquarters of the illegal cocaine traffic. The others were peasants killed when police, claiming they were fired on, shot into crowds of marchers, the ministry said. A military alert was declared Thursday because of the violence. Former President <PERSON> Misael </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastrana </PERSON>, the opposition leader, urged President President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> to return from abroad. <PERSON> Pastrana </PERSON> said in a broadcast address Thursday that the `` country is in flames.'' <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>: `` The situation in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> is totally normal, in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> and the rest of the country. ... I do n't see any reason to abandon the trip We have experienced situations such as these in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> for 30 years.'' He said opposition demands for his return were part of a `` psychological war aimed at damaging a very important trip.'' After three days in <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Barco </ORGANIZATION> will visit the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> for an audience with Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> and then go to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared Friday `` I'm the underdog and I like it'' and said his weak showing against Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in recent public opinion polls is not a liability. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters at his oceanside retreat that the polls spur him to wage a more aggressive general election campaign. He cited his comeback to clinch the Republican presidential nomination after losing in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s first-in-the-nation caucuses. The vice president also urged a renewal in collapsed negotiations to persuade Panamanian Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to leave power, although he earlier opposed those talks. `` If we can find some way to get him out and still bring him to justice, that would suit me just fine,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, adding that he would prefer to bring other <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> leaders into the negotiating process. At the same time, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> characterized as `` an outrageous lie'' what he said was a reported suggestion that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had initiated the talks to help his campaign. `` When you read these outrageous charges by a drug-related, indicted dictator, discount them. They are total lies.'' `` And I do n't like it being injected by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> either. If they have some proof, or they have something other than nuance and insinuation, let them speak out.'' With the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> surf pounding behind him, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters on the lawn of his family retreat that recent polls, including a new <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Post-ABC poll showing him trailing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by 13 points, were helping to generate his competitive juices. `` I'm the underdog and I like it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` It is May and the election is in November. Do I worry about it? I do n't worry about it. I like fighting back. -LRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> -RRB- is the front-runner. He's been decreed that in poll after poll And I like fighting back. I remember <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has scheduled meetings here over the next week with advisers and prominent Republicans in an effort to get his campaign back on track. Among those he met with on Friday were Govs. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, former housing secretary <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, former deputy Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, former domestic policy adviser to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> conceded that polls showing he far lags behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> among women voters were of particular concern. `` What I've got to do is more clearly define what I feel on certain women's issues. One of them will be day care,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attributed some of his upbeat attitude to his surroundings. `` It's the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> air,'' he said. `` When I get up here I feel _ it's not feistiness _ but I feel very relaxed about it. I do n't feel troubled by somebody pointing out I'm behind in the polls ... I'm coming out of 10 points down in these polls and I've got five months to fight back.'' `` There's a little bit of a cholesterol rise, the frustration level going up, in terms of sitting around and listening to -LRB- <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> dump all over me and the administration. So I'm beginning to get a little more combative.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also scoffed at polls that suggested Americans view <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as more conservative than he. `` That, by any stretch of the imagination, is hard to believe,'' he said. `` In terms of neighborhood values _ anticrime, pledge of allegiance -LRB- in schools -RRB-, penalties for those who are really corrupting these neighborhoods _ he is on the far left side of things. I do n't think that blue-collar <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, or ethnic <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, wants to move away from the kinds of values I've been talking about.''

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is showing a new flexibility on such <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> issues as a Palestinian state and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s refusal to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said Friday In a separate development, Soviet officials have agreed to collaborate with an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> rabbi and Western scholars on a project to research Soviet collections of Jewish historical materials. A Soviet delegation outlined the new position during secret talks in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> this month with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, said the official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. `` If what they have hinted at is indeed their official position ... then the gaps between us seem bridgeable,'' the official said. He said the Soviets no longer insist that an independent Palestinian state in the Israeli-occupied territories be a required result of an international conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` The way they phrase it, it is up to the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> to decide who they want to be confederated with,'' he said. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> also showed flexibility about the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, he said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> calls the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> a terrorist group and refuses to negotiate with it. According to the official, the Soviets want the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> invited to an international conference but said the invitation should carry a condition that all participants accept <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. `` We see a very clear distinction between the Soviet attitude to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, for example,'' he said. `` <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is a very important asset, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> less so. They will not sell the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> down the river easily, but they feel what they have to do to protect the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is less.'' The Soviet position paper was prepared by <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Zotov </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy director for the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, the official said, adding that <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> met with a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> delegation first in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, during a a <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> conference, and then in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Billat </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Talmudic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION>, directed by Rabbi <PERSON> Adin </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinsaltz </PERSON>, announced the research project Thursday. He also said the <PERSON> Steinsaltz </PERSON> would be allowed to open an institute in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to train Jewish scholars. `` We consider this as a major breakthrough, and what is important is that it was the Soviet initiative,'' <PERSON> Billat </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> severed diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> after the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war, but the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said agreement has been reached for an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> consular delegation to be sent there for the first time since the break. A Foreign Ministry official said the ministry was not aware of the research project but welcomed it as a `` positive development.''

 One of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s best-known white apartheid opponents met Friday with representatives of an outlawed black guerrilla movement but said the two sides formed no concrete agreements about reforming their country. <PERSON> Frederik </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Zyl </PERSON> <PERSON> Slabbert </PERSON>, former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, met with four national executive committee members of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, including information and publicity head <PERSON> Thabo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON>. Among the topics discussed was the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s use of violence to bring about reform in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The two sides met in a <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> hotel. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, wages a bombing and sabotage campaign to oust <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white-led government. `` No resolutions were adopted, and no decisions were taken'' with the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> on that issue, <PERSON> Slabbert </PERSON> said, but he said the discussions were `` frank and open.'' `` I certainly do not condone bomb attacks or violence or tactics of terror of any kind,'' he added. <PERSON> Slabbert </PERSON> said the two sides discussed a broad range of issues. `` This would be a totally impossible situation in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, that you can have this kind of discussion,'' he said. `` The image of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> amongst whites has been demonized ... by the state and its propaganda.'' <PERSON> Slabbert </PERSON>, director of an anti-apartheid think tank, said he hoped such discussions with the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> and other groups would help start a process of dialogue and debate. `` We would be happy to facilitate further discussions of this kind,'' <PERSON> Slabbert </PERSON> said, speaking on behalf of his organization, the Institute for a Democratic Alternative. <PERSON> Slabbert </PERSON> said he was finished with his current round of talks with the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> and that he would fly to <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> on Saturday for other business. The four <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> delegates met Thursday with an eight-member delegation headed by <PERSON> Wynand </PERSON> <PERSON> Malan </PERSON>, a parliamentary member and head of the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. As they met, two bombs exploded in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> and injured four people. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s law and order minister blamed the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> for the blasts. Five delegates from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> attended Friday's meeting between the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Slabbert </PERSON> as observers, movement delegate <PERSON> Harald </PERSON> <PERSON> Pakendorf </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Slabbert </PERSON> resigned from <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, saying the body had become irrelevant and incapable of solving <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s racial problems. Last July, <PERSON> Slabbert </PERSON> led a group of about 50 South African whites for three days of talks with the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>. Those talks were widely condemned by the South African government and right-wing groups, who portray the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> as a terrorist organization and oppose all contacts with the group. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> on Friday urged Christians in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to reject violence in fighting apartheid, which he said had exacted a `` terrible toll.'' `` I pray that the Christian communities in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> will continue to foster only peaceful means of responding to the difficulties of the present situation,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said in remarks to a visiting delegation of South African churchmen, including Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>. The pope restated his and the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s opposition to all forms of racial discrimination, adding that a change in the structures of discrimination requires `` a change of hearts.'' The 10-member delegation was a joint group of the South African Council of Churches and the Southern African Catholic Bishops' Conference In their address to the pope, the church officials said recent government actions in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> have `` resulted in bitterness, resentment and frustration _ feelings which can easily lead to violence.'' They said an emergency meeting of church leaders will be held in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> on May 30. `` The emergency convocation will develop effective non-violent action to put pressure on the South African government to sit at the negotiating table and for the church to refuse to collaborate with the unjust system,'' the delegation said in a news statement. At a news conference, <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, said the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> was making an `` eloquent statement'' by not visiting <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> during his tour of four African nations next September. `` It speaks to the perpetrators of apartheid, it speaks to the victims,'' he said. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> called for tougher sanctions by Western nations against the South African government. `` If we do not apply sanctions, or if sanctions are ineffective, what is effective?,'' he said. `` If you say sanctions will fail or have failed, than you can tell us what will succeed ... then the very last last option available is violence and we have consistently expressed our opposition to violence ... So we say, ` help us.''' He criticized <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for its trade links with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` We hope that the Japanese would be embarassed that they have stepped into a vacuum,'' he said. `` I hope the Japanese will remember that they were insulted in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> when the government was enforcing racial classification. Because they wanted the Japanese as traders, they called them ` honorary Europeans.' I would hope they would get so upset, they would go back home.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> today overwhelmingly approved a treaty eliminating <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles, ratifying the first major arms pact between the two superpowers in 16 years. The final vote was 93-5. Ratification requires the approval of two-thirds of the members present and voting. Approval of the treaty came in time for it to be presented to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at his summit meeting with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, which begins Sunday in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. It also gave cause for optimism to those who see the relatively modest INF accord as paving the way for a more ambitious treaty making deep cuts in the two sides' arsenals of long-range nuclear missiles. `` We are making a breakthrough,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Whip <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif. `` It is not a substantively significant treaty But it lays the foundation'' for future treaties `` that can substantially reduce the scale, cost and dangers of this arms race.'' Senators voting against the treaty were Republicans <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and Democrat <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Sens. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, did not vote The pact was the first U.S.-Soviet weapons treaty to be approved since the 1972 accord on Anti-Ballistic Missiles. White House officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> issued a statement from the president following the vote, in which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said: `` I am very pleased with the action of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in consenting to ratification of the INF treaty. In two days I will arrive in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to meet with General Secretary <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to discuss our four-part agenda. Today's action by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> clearly shows support for our arms reduction objectives.'' As it moved toward approval, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> adopted strong language governing future interpretations of the medium-range missile treaty, and turned aside a series of Republican amendments that would have undermined that provision. `` I think we've closed all the loopholes we know about in this treaty, and it's a much better treaty than when it was sent'' to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. Va.. Thursday's session had ended on a testy partisan note, with <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> threatening to let the treaty languish if Republicans continued to seek what he saw as Approval of the treaty was considered certain because it requires a two-thirds vote of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, or 67 votes, and as many as 90 senators have expressed support for it. But the possibility of delay remained alive. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> warned <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senators that they risked embarrassing their own president by failing to deliver the approved treaty in time for the Sunday start of the summit. `` This is no empty threat,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> admonished senators. `` If we're going to continue to have <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON> amendments like this, the president is not going to have his treaty before he leaves the summit.'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Kan </LOCATION>., informed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> of the decision during a telephone call to <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> moments after the vote The two leaders accepted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s invitation to come to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> next Tuesday and bring the ratification documents with them. One amendment, an attempt by Sen. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., to make any Soviet violation grounds for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> withdrawal from the treaty, was defeated on a vote of 66-30 And a move by Sen. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.D. </LOCATION>, to require <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to certify at the summit whether the Soviets are living up to their human rights obligations, also was defeated, 86-10. On Thursday, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> had won overwhelming bipartisan passage of an amendment stipulating that the White House will be bound in the future by the interpretation of the treaty as expressed by administration officials during congressional hearings. Any effort to change that interpretation would have to be approved again by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> before becoming valid, said the amendment, which passed on a vote of 72-27. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has clearly made visible that it is an equal partner with any president in the making of treaties,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said after the provision was adopted, `` and I hope that will be a sobering impact on this president and on Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> when they sit down and discuss another agreement'' on limiting long-range nuclear weapons. The provision grew out of a dispute with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration over <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> efforts to redefine the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty with the Soviets to allow greater latitude for testing of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Star Wars missile defense program. But a few hours after the vote on the <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> amendment, Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., came close to undermining the provision by proposing a change stipulating that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could not be bound by any interpretation of the treaty `` that is not equally binding on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s proposal was killed, 53-45, and an angry <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> sent the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> home for the night. The vote was virtually a party-line division. Two similar attempts by Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., were defeated today by wider margins The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, signed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Dec. 8, requires the elimination within three years of all nuclear missiles with a range of 300 miles to 3,400 miles, and would result in the destruction of 867 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and 1,752 Soviet missiles. While those numbers represent a relatively small slice of each side's total nuclear arsenal, the pact is regarded as particularly important because it breaks a long drought in arms-control agreements between the two sides and sets the stage for progress on a much larger goal: massive cuts in each side's long-range nuclear missile fleet. It was also important because it would be the first treaty to actually require the destruction of weapons, rather than simply slowing growth in their numbers. And its far-reaching verification provisions include the first on-site inspections allowed by either superpower.

<TEXT>
 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, conceding that women's negative views are hurting him in the polls, promised Friday he would spell out `` what I feel on certain women's issues.'' Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said his own positions are evident from his record on pay equity, child care and affirmative action. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his `` gender gap'' problem _ the difficulty he and some other Republicans have had in drawing votes from women _ would be discussed during the coming week of meetings with <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> governors and other party officials at his <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, retreat. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner, continued to blast the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for its dealings with <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> military leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, talking of alleged $ 200,000 payments by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> as well as the failed negotiations to get him out of power. `` We've been paying that guy what we pay the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Friday in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, N.M.. `` You ca n't be serious about waging a real war against drugs when we have an administration that ca n't say no to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The vice president, though saying he has not agreed with some administration policies dealing with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goal remains the same despite the breakdown in talks designed to remove him from power. `` If we can find some way to get him out and bring him to justice, that would suit me just fine,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a news conference on the lawn in front of his vacation retreat in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, grinding toward a nominating majority expected in ten days, met briefly with remaining party rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> airport. The men emerged smiling from the session that lasted about five minutes. Aides would not discuss the substance of the meeting. Earlier, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> reached out to <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>, saying they have been ignored by the federal government. `` It's not too much to ask for a summit with the American Indian leadership,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told Indian leaders at the <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pueblo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` Hispanics in the barrios, blacks in the ghettos, ranchers on ranches, Indians on reservations ... there's a tendency of these people to be abandoned by law.'' The Democratic candidates planned Memorial Day weekend campaigning in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, which joins <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> in the final round of presidential primaries on June 7. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has more than 1,700 of the 2,081 delegate votes he needs to win the party's nomination, with 466 at stake June 7. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, spending a week in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> during the superpower summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, said he is getting recharged for a combative stance as the underdog against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the fall campaign for the White House. `` I like fighting back,'' he declared. `` It's the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> air,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee-to-be. `` When I get up here I feel _ it's not feistiness _ but I feel very relaxed about it. I do n't feel troubled by somebody pointing out I'm behind in the polls. ... I'm coming out of 10 points down in these polls and I've got five months to fight back.'' The latest <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll said that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has a 53-40 margin over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> among registered voters. In the poll, women favored <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 61-33, while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led among men by four percentage points. Other polls have also showed a gender gap, although not as large as this one. `` What I've got to do is more clearly define what I feel on certain women's issues. One of them will be day care,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also noted the polls during his appearences in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, where he, too, talked about women's issues. `` We Democrats have the best chance to win the presidency in years and we're going to do it,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>. `` I've never seen our party so united. ... I've never seen our party so together. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor emphasized the family during that speech prior to an outdoor rally, saying his record demonstrates his commitment to affirmative action, pay equity, child care and welfare reform. He said he and his wife, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>, are committed to strengthening the family, calling it `` the single most important institution in our nation and our world.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he is angered by constant criticism from Democrats. `` We're going to put it a little more in focus,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` The frustration level -LRB- is -RRB- going up, in terms of sitting around and listening to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> dump all over me and the administration. So I'm beginning to get a little more combative.'' He denounced what he said were polls saying Americans view <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as more conservative than he. `` That, by any stretch of the imagination, is hard to believe,'' he said. `` In terms of neighborhood values _ anti-crime, pledge of allegiance, penalties for those who are really corrupting these neighborhoods _ he is on the far left-side of things.''

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of Syrian soldiers wearing bulletproof vests over combat fatigues moved into the south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> slums Friday, halting a three-week war between rival Shiite Moslem militias that killed nearly 300 people. The intervention, under a <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> agreement with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, is expected to increase pressure for the release of the 18 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, who include nine Americans. Most are believed held in the slums by extremists linked to the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, which gained control of nearly all south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in the battle with the Amal militia that began May 6. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>, a mainstream group allied with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, stopped shooting as the soldiers began moving in at 11 a.m.. A few hours earlier, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s four top generals in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> escaped harm in an ambush in a south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> neighborhood controlled by <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> Dozens of bullets hit the generals' Mercedes, but its armor plating saved them. `` Otherwise, there would have been no survivors,'' a police spokesman said. As the Shiite guns fell silent, fighting broke out in the <LOCATION> Bourj </LOCATION> el-Barajneh Palestinian refugee camp between pro-Syrian guerrillas and <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, the main army of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Police said they had no word on the cause or casualties in the camp, which is adjacent to the Shiite slums. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said of the <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> move: `` We welcome an end to the suffering of the civilian residents of the southern suburbs. We hope the current arrangement, which includes a Lebanese police element, can be a first step toward restoring the central government's authority.'' About 900 Syrian infantrymen in three groups advanced on foot into the 16 square miles of tin-roofed huts and cement-block apartments next to the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport. They carried machine guns and shoulder-fired grenade launchers. Following the first group of Syrians were 52 Lebanese policemen with automatic rifles. Syrian soldiers set up five checkpoints along a disengagement line between the <LOCATION> Shiyah </LOCATION> neighborhood, held by <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>, and the Hezbollah-controlled <LOCATION> Ghobeiri </LOCATION> district, where the generals were ambushed. The line stretched through two miles of gutted shops, smoldering wrecked cars and bullet-scarred cement-block shanties. Broken power cables dangled on streets littered with glass shards and spent cartidges. <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters on the slum's fringes stared intently at a group of 20 American and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> journalists, who traveled from <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> with Syrian escorts to cover the deployment. `` I feel like a juicy T-bone steak in front of a hungry man,'' one reporter said. Checkpoints also were established at key road junctions in the <LOCATION> Hay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moawad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mesharrafieh </LOCATION> neighborhoods, controlled by <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. Wailing women on sidewalks and balconies showered the Syrians with rose water and rice in a traditional gesture of welcome. `` Animals! They are all animals, animals killing animals!'' a man shouted in English from in front of his shattered house when he saw Western correspondents covering the Syrian advance. He said <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters seized his home from <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militiamen in the final phase of the battle, which according to police killed a total of 296 people and wounded 1,000. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> gained control of 90 percent of the area, which has long been a refuge for kidnappers, hijackers and assassins. Reporters saw two bulldozers clearing mounds of earth and pushing sandbag barricades from the streets. Syrian specialists defused land mines and unexploded bombs. Half an hour before the deployment began, shell blasts and bursts of gunfire resounded across <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> from the Shiite slums. Police said they did not know what started the shooting. Both sides had pledged to observe a `` final cease-fire.'' <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> security chief in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> were withdrawing their fighters from all south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> neighborhoods and would put them on the line that separates the capital's Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> sectors. His brothers, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, are held in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on terrorist charges. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> is accused of the 1985 <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacking in which a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver was killed and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> represents <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> on a four-party committee set up Friday to supervise the truce. When the agreement was announced Thursday, a <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> official told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> privately: `` Ending the fighting will create new hope for the hostages, and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> will spare no effort to secure their release.'' He said preserving their lives was the first priority, `` then there can be hope for their release through negotiations.'' The hostage held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, kidnapped March 16, 1985. There was no word on when the Syrians would send tanks and other armor into the slums, but the second phase of the deployment was to be completed Saturday. An estimated 7,500 Syrian troops, 100 tanks and 400 armored personnel carriers ringed the slums for 13 days, waiting for orders to move. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has 25,000 soldiers in eastern and northern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and about 7,500 patrolling Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has become <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s main power broker during 13 years of civil war, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has used <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> to challenge Syrian influence among the 1.2 million Shiites, the largest sect in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

 Two men on a motorcycle fired at least six shots Friday at a military prosecutor handling the cases against leftist guerrillas who tried to kill President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> in 1986, police said. The prosecutor, army Col. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, was unharmed after the men fired at his car. <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> said the attack was being investigated, `` but as far as I am concerned, it was just a traffic incident.'' <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>' bodyguards shot back at the attackers as they fled, said <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> police chief Gen. <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ormeno </PERSON>.

Police did not confirm the report, and no bomb was found. <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> is prosecuting dozens of suspected leftist guerrillas charged with a number of attacks against government and police officials.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, underscoring a key theme for the superpower summit, said Friday reforms championed by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> are `` new and good'' but that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> still falls short of meeting international standards on human rights and freedom. Two days before his arrival in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` Soviet practice does not _ or does not yet _ measure up to <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> commitment'' under the 1975 East-West agreement known as the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Final Act. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> gave <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> a big pre-summit boost Friday when it ratified by an overwhelming 93-5 vote the treaty outlawing medium-range nuclear missiles which the president and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed at their <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit last December. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> issued a statement saying he was `` very pleased'' with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote, which he said `` clearly shows support for our arms reduction objectives.'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., who telephoned the president in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> with the news, accepted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s invitation to fly to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Tuesday to witness a ratification ceremony the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made his human rights speech before an invited audience of about 1,200 people in the austerely-designed marble auditorium of <LOCATION> Finlandia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> accords were signed by 35 nations, including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Under the agreement, the Soviets pledged to provide more liberty for their people and those in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. And yet, 13 years later, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, the cases of divided families and blocked marriages remain on the <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> agenda, while Russians trying to emigrate are subjected to artificial quotas and arbitrary rulings. `` And what are we to think of the continued suppression of those who wish to practice their religious beliefs?'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked. At the same time, he said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s twin campaigns of `` glasnost,'' or openness, and `` perestroika,'' the restructuring of the economy, are `` words that to our ears have a particularly welcome sound.'' Thirteen years ago, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and other conservatives had opposed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> signing of the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> agreement because it implicitly accepted <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> European boundaries set after World War II in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s favor. Yet <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spoke glowingly of the accords Friday, saying, `` And, despite the doubts of the critics, for the past 13 years the signatory states have mustered the political will to keep on working and making progress.'' The address, coupled with an official welcoming ceremony earlier at the presidential palace, marked the only time <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ventured from the seclusion of a government guest house where he is spending 3 -LCB- days resting and preparing for the summit. In other developments: _ A Soviet source in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, declining to be named publicly, said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> plans to hold a news conference during the summit _ the first time a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> general secretary will have held such a session on home territory _ <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Primakov </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> adviser, accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of violating a peace accord by continuing to ship arms to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s anti-communist <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas _ <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>, a top Soviet arms control official, called on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to speed up negotiations on a treaty to cut long-range nuclear arsenals by making good on promises of compromise _ The <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> intends to raise the issue of the Vietnamese occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and said it hopes reports of a possible troop withdrawal provide impetus for the talks Accompanied by his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, the president will depart Sunday morning on a 1 -LCB- - hour flight to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for his fourth summit with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> since November 1985 They are to meet a total of six hours from Sunday afternoon until Wednesday morning. The two will say good-bye to each other Thursday. At <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> insistence, the number of meetings was cut from five to four. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> professed to be unconcerned, telling reporters at the palace there only had been four meetings at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit last December. `` I think we have to recognize that the -LRB- Soviet -RRB- government has normal business that has to be conducted, and we have to schedule accordingly. That's what we did in our summit in our town,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said as he posed for pictures with Finnish President <PERSON> Mauno </PERSON> <PERSON> Koivisto </PERSON> in a second-floor salon adorned with silken draperies and crystal chandeliers. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also was asked about reports that the Soviets were blocking various dissidents from attending a planned meeting with him in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Monday. He looked quizzically at Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, seated to his right, and replied, `` We do the best we can.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has received assurances from the Soviets they will not block dissidents and `` refuseniks'' from attending the meeting. `` The event is on as scheduled and the people we wanted there will be there,'' he added. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the guests were picked because `` they represent the problem that he -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB- is trying to dramatize.'' As for the reports that some people were being stopped from attending, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We're trying to ascertain the facts and have made an inquiry of the Soviets.'' Underscoring the sensitivity of the topic, Jewish groups gathered in the Finnish capital to mount public pressure on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in behalf of Soviet Jews waiting for exit permits and those seeking wider latitude to teach and practice their religion. In his speech, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said human rights would be `` an integral component'' of his dialogue with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. In a pre-summit briefing, Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Rozanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON> said it would be `` subject No. 1.'' The fact that the superpowers were not able to reach agreement on a strategic arms treaty to be signed at the summit probably will give even more visibility to the human rights issue. Praising <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for his `` glasnost''' and perestroika,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that `` since he began his campaign, things have happened that all of us applaud.'' He hailed the release from exile or labor camps <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Irina </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratushinskaya </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anatoliy </PERSON> <PERSON> Koryagin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Begun </PERSON> and other dissidents and `` prisoners of conscience.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also noted that controversial books and movies are being distributed, even though they are critical of the Soviet past and present. The Soviets also are allowing a higher level of emigration and greater toleration of dissent and are beginning to pull their troops out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, he said. `` All this is new and good,'' he said. `` But there is another list, defined not by us but by the standard of the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Final Act and the sovereign choice of all participants, including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, to subscribe to it.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Friday said he welcomed `` every sign that the Soviets and their allies are ready, not only to embrace, but to put into practice'' Western values. `` The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> is a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> whose doors are open to all,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. He renewed his call for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to tear down the Berlin Wall and other barriers between East and West. `` They could also give legal and practical protection to free expression and worship,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. He also urged adoption of an independent judiciary, free election of lawmakers, use of secret ballots in voting and freedom of assembly. Before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spoke, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Jewish activists for Soviet Jews urged the president to remind the Soviets that human rights were indirectly linked to progress in arms control. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abram </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewry </ORGANIZATION>, said Jewish emigration is a `` test of whether arms reductions can succeed.'' <PERSON> Abram </PERSON> called the improvement in Jewish emigration figures `` insignificant compared with those who wish to leave ... It's smoke and mirrors as far as the the right to leave is concerned.

<HEAD>Tighter U.S. Sanctions Would Hurt South Africa, Business Group
Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Proposed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> legislation to tighten economic sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> would hurt it more than previous boycotts, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business group said Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> said limited <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions imposed in 1986 carried little impact. But legislation now being considered by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` would have far-reaching negative effects on all companies operating in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and on the South African economy as a whole,'' group officials said. The chamber, which represents interests of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, opposes sanctions. Five chamber members traveled to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in April and met with congressmen and aides to lobby against additional sanctions. `` The measures now being debated dwarf anything that's been done so far,'' said <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, executive directer of the group. Both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are weighing sanctions designed to protest <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s apartheid policies of racial segregation. The two similar bills would cut virtually all economic activity between the two countries. The moves would include disinvestment by all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies, whose South African investments are estimated at $ 1.1 billion. All trade would be banned, except for certain strategic minerals the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> buys from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 1987 were about $ 1.3 billion and exports were also $ 1.3 billion. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said the South African government's February decision effectively banning 17 leading anti-apartheid organizations had put the sanctions issue `` back on the boil'' in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The limited sanctions approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 over President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto banned importation of certain goods and halted direct air links between the two countries. The chamber said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has become `` complacent about further sanctions-disinvestment due to the fact that, in the short term, a large number of individuals and companies have benefited.'' Many American businesses that left <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> sold profitable operations to local businessmen at bargain prices. About 160 American companies have departed in the past two years, while about 155 remain. A wide range of South Africans, including some blacks and anti-apartheid whites, oppose sanctions on the grounds that blacks are most likely to suffer any economic hardships that result. Proponents of sanctions say economic pressure will speed up the government's race reforms. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>West Germans Halt Investigation of Black Market Heavy Water Sale</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A West German prosecutor has stopped the investigation of a shipment of heavy water, a material used in nuclear weapons production, that may have been transported illegally to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> expert and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources said Friday. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Milhollin </PERSON>, an American expert on the international market in heavy water, said a <LOCATION> Dusseldorf </LOCATION> prosecutor has dropped the investigation because he was convinced that documents were in order for shipment of the Norwegian-made heavy water by a West German company in 1983. `` He has decided that the water went where it was supposed to go and has halted the investigation,'' said <PERSON> Milhollin </PERSON>, who is a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> professor on leave to the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The Associated Press in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> was unable to reach the West German prosecutor for comment on the report, which was the second allegation recently that Norwegian-produced heavy water had been diverted illegally. <PERSON> Milhollin </PERSON> and a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official who spoke only on condition of anonymity said the 1983 heavy water shipment may have been diverted secretly to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> by way of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has an interest in acquiring heavy water secretly. He said undocumented heavy water could be used secretly to produce and stockpile plutonium, which, in turn, could be used to make atomic weapons in violation of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. <PERSON> Milhollin </PERSON> said that in 1985, a West German company attempted to hire an airline to fly undocumented heavy water to <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, but that the airline declined to take the shipment. Because of this history, he said, it is widely speculated that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> received the earlier secret shipment. The Indian government has denied the heavy water shipment was transported to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Heavy water, or deuterium oxide, is used as a modulator in a nuclear reactor. It permits reactors to run on natural uranium instead of the more expensive and more tightly controlled enriched uranium fuel. A byproduct from the nuclear reactor is plutonium, the heart of nuclear bombs. On Tuesday, the Norwegian government said it also was investigating whether a 1986 shipment of heavy water to <LOCATION> Rumania </LOCATION> had been diverted improperly. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> on Wednesday denied reports in the Hungarian news media it had sold the 12 -LCB- ton heavy water shipment to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> source said Friday that officials in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> were continuing to press for an investigation of the 1983 West German shipment. A Norwegian company, <ORGANIZATION> Norsk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hydro </ORGANIZATION>, sold the shipment to the West German concern, <PERSON> Rohstoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Einfuhr </PERSON>. Under the terms of the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty, such sales are subject to inspection and close documentation. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rumania </LOCATION> are parties to the treaty. <PERSON> Milhollin </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Norsk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hydro </ORGANIZATION> officials said they have four documents showing <PERSON> Rohstoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Einfuhr </PERSON> was buying the heavy water for shipment to <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. The documents include an export license from the Norwegian government; an import certificate from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>; an airbill from <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which was transporting the shipment; and a sales contract between the two companies. Despite the documents, however, the shipment was flown from <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, where another 6.6 tons of cargo was added. The <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> plane then flew from <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>. It later left <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>, but its destination was not been documented, <PERSON> Milhollin </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said. <PERSON> Milhollin </PERSON> said the West German prosecutor decided to drop his investigation after <PERSON> Rohstoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Einfuhr </PERSON> provided copies of a telegram and a letter showing the destination of the heavy water shipment had been changed from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. The West German company claims these documents were sent to <ORGANIZATION> Norsk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hydro </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Norsk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hydro </ORGANIZATION>, however, claim the documents never were received and that the heavy water was shipped with the understanding that it was going <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Fifteen tons of heavy water is sufficient to produce about 13 pounds of plutonium a year. A bomb the size of the first one exploded over <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in 1945 uses about nine pounds of plutonium.

<HEAD>NASA Inviting Industry Ideas For Using External Fuel Tanks In
Orbit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, which expects to use and lose 40 space shuttle external fuel tanks in flights over the next five years, invited industry on Friday to come up with ideas for making productive use of the tanks in orbit. Now, they are allowed to break up in the atmosphere and fall into the ocean. The 152-foot tanks, which cost $ 25 million each, will be given away free but the user must pay for any costs not incurred under the present system of discarding them. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> wants the money up front. A <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> group, which represents 57 university research institutions, has proposed to use tanks for `` a wide variety of scientific and commercial concerns.'' The group, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, proposes `` parking'' the exhausted tanks in orbit but <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> ruled out any such plan. The use must be stated in advance and a $ 100,000 deposit will be required before the space agency provides services or technical assistance. The external tank, about the size of a 747 jet transport, consists of two pressurized fuel tanks _ one loaded with liquid oxygen and one with liquid hydrogen. The half-million gallons of fuel are used up in the 10 minutes it takes for the shuttle to get into orbit and the tank is jettisoned just before that point. The space agency's announcement asks interested American companies and non-profit organizations to propose uses within 90 days. It is in line with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s space policy which calls for using the tanks for commercial purposes. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> plans to launch 40 shuttles through 1994. It said the exact number of tanks that could be made available will be decided flight-by-flight depending on the characteristics of the mission and the proposed use for a particular tank.

<TEXT>
 African leaders Friday condemned Western companies for dumping their nuclear and other wastes in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and agreed to ask the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to call for an end to the practice. `` The dumping of nuclear and dangerous industrial waste in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is a crime against <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the African peoples,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> said in a resolution adopted by heads of state during the second day of their three-day summit. More than 30 leaders gathered with their aides at the 50-member body's headquarters here `` We will make an appeal to the conscience of the world,'' said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ike </PERSON> <PERSON> Nwachukwu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, which sponsored Friday's resolutions `` All <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> feels strongly about it.'' But <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> and other African states privately chastized some of their fellow group nmembers for agreeing to take industrial waste in return for millions of dollars. One resolution appealed to African countries that have signed such agreements to abrogate them and those still negotiating to break off talks. The controversy began this month in <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> when officials discovered that a Norwegian company had been dumping toxic waste on an offshore island. The dumping was discovered when the island's trees began to shrivel Several African nations either have signed contracts to accept industrial wastes, are negotiating, or have been approached, summit sources said. The West African nations of <LOCATION> Benin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bissau </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION> reportedly have signed contracts, and the tiny southern African nation of <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Djibouti </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> have been approached. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gambia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leone </LOCATION> confirmed during Friday's debate that they had been approached by companies looking for dump sites for toxic wastes, but each government said it had rejected the proposals. All three mentioned a company based on <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> but would not reveal the name. <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bissau </LOCATION> said it had asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to evaluate a request from a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company to export 6 million tons of hazardous waste to the West African nation. Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Marcellino </PERSON> <PERSON> Lima </PERSON> did not say what <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bissau </LOCATION> was offered. But an environmental source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the deal was worth $ 15 million. <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> said he doubted <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bissau </LOCATION> would accept. Summit sources and reports from the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> also said a Dutch company had signed an $ 84 million contract with <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION> to dump 1 million tons of chemical wastes in the West African state.

<HEAD>Dramatic Photo Warning on Acne Drug Unlikely To Be First of Many</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An unprecedented government order to include the image of a deformed baby in packaging for the acne drug Accutane is unlikely to be followed by similar orders for other drugs with potential side-effects, analysts said Friday. On Thursday, the drug's maker, <ORGANIZATION> Hoffman-La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Nutley </LOCATION>, released a <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> letter outlining stricter warning requirements for the drug, which can cause life-threatening damage to fetuses when taken by pregnant women. Among other restrictions, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> also wants <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> to provide a consent form to be signed by physician and patient saying they understand the risks associated with the drug. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Advest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, a business research firm, said he doubted that the use of a jolting image such as a deformed baby would become widespread in the drug industry. He called the photograph a compromise between banning the drug and doing nothing, and said such a strong warning was acceptable to regulators and the company because Accutane is not a lifesaving drug. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigg </PERSON> said the side effects of other drugs are not as easily captured in a picture as a deformed infant, so trying to apply images to other products would be impractical. Accutane, which was put on the market in 1982, can cause missing facial features, heart problems and mental retardation in babies born to women taking it. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said 62 cases of birth defects have been reported. But dermatologists have praised the drug as the only one on the market capable of curing the severe acne that causes deep scarring. The new <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> requirements are based on the recommendations of an advisory panel of outside experts, who also recommended that the drug stay on the market. Accutane already carries explicit warnings that its use by pregnant women carries a high risk of birth defects. Analysts and <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> officials said that including a deformed infant's picture with the drug was a first. `` Because of the controversy, you're going to see a significant decrease in the use of the drug,'' said <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Habermas </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Sanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bernstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> called the drug a `` significant'' but not major factor in Swiss-owned La Roche's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales. Accutane sales last year amounted to $ 60 million, or 16 percent of the company's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oral drug sales, he said. The deformed infant picture could affect sales, just as `` whenever you emphasize negatives,'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said. `` I think that they're just trying to be absolutely clear that a certain category -LRB- of patient -RRB- should n't use it,'' he said. <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glynn </PERSON> said `` our only goal is making sure users do n't get pregnant.''

The company is preparing a formal response to the letter. One point of possible contention is the exact location of the photograph. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said the picture should go with packaging, but Ms. <PERSON> Grigg </PERSON> said the company favors its inclusion somewhere in `` educational materials'' the company is developing to be provided to prescribing physicians. `` There's not going to be a problem over that situation,'' said <PERSON> Grigg </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made a campaign promise on Friday to his neighbors: Local lobstermen wo n't be barred from the waters near his vacation home because of him. `` These men and women make their livelihood pulling lobsters out of this bay. They've done it for years. And they're going to continue to do it,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, here for a week of rest and strategy talks, voiced concern over local news accounts suggesting that if he wins the presidency in November some of the waters of this seacoast town might be closed to boaters, including lobstermen, for security reasons. `` That's absolutely absurd,'' he told a news conference at his compound as a lone lobsterman plied his trade from his boat just a few hundred yards away. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s family compound, comprising two homes and several smaller guest cottages, sits on a narrow point _ <LOCATION> Walker </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> _ that juts into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. On the inland side, a dozen crab pots dot the small cove between the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> compound and the shore, all within a stone's throw. The shoreline and the road leading into the compound are heavily guarded, but local lobstermen are currently permitted to work the waters adjacent to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s property. `` I do n't want to inconvenience our neighbors,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who said he had been coming to the retreat for every summer of the 63 years of his life except one _ 1944, when he was at war. `` These people have been fishing in these waters, wartime or not wartime, and I ca n't ever remember any different,'' he said. The issue of whether the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> would declare the waters around the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> compound off-limits if he is elected has been the subject of much recent local speculation. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he wanted to put the issue to rest. `` I do n't want to convolute the life of people who earn their livings here all year-round,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` If it became a choice between whether these lobstermen can fish in this bay, or I would stop coming to this place I love, I would not come here,'' he said. `` And it would break my heart.'' `` But it's not going to come to that,'' he added.

<HEAD>Economist Says Anti-Alcohol Campaign Handled Poorly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Soviet economist said Friday that <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has mishandled his anti-drunkenness campaign by emphasizing police methods instead of taking the long-range view of offering consumers a better choice of goods. <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Shmelev </PERSON> said the Soviet leader's campaign has driven drinking underground, encouraged moonshiners and deprived the government of liquor sales revenue. <PERSON> Shmelev </PERSON>, whose stinging criticisms of the Soviet economy in the literary journal Novy Mir have caused a wave of controversy, spoke to reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and expanded on comments he made in a recent article. He said the campaign got drunks off the streets and out of the workplace. But he added, `` Unfortunately, I am afraid nothing has changed.'' `` The structure of consumption has changed. Instead of state-produced spirits they drink moonshine, they sometimes drink chemicals,'' he said. Some Soviets turned to drinking hair tonic, cologne and rubbing alcohol in a desperate search for spirits. <PERSON> Shmelev </PERSON> said a more effective but long-term way to solve the drinking problem is to improve consumer supplies `` so a man could use his ruble to buy a bottle of vodka or a good shirt.'' Soviet consumer goods are of notoriously poor quality and in short supply. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has promised to improve the lives of Soviets by improving the quantity and quality of food and consumer goods. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s anti-alcohol campaign, his first major initiative after taking power in March 1985, included raising the drinking age, shortening the hours of liquor stores and cutting liquor production. He and other officials credited the campaign with helping increase the life expectancy for Soviet men in the past two years. The Kremlin for years did not publish life expectancy figures, presumably because they were embarrassing. Complaints have been voiced in the Soviet press, however, that too many liquor stores have closed, forcing people who want to buy an occasional bottle of wine or vodka to stand in line for hours. <PERSON> Shmelev </PERSON> said alcoholism will be a `` problem for a number of generations, for a number of decades.'' An economist close to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aganbegyan </PERSON>, told reporters the anti-alcohol campaign achieved `` very impressive results'' in cutting liquor sales. But he added, `` Now moonshine is consumed in great quantities, even greater than before the anti-alcohol campaign was launched.'' <PERSON> Aganbegyan </PERSON> said the effort to convince people not to drink was poorly handled, and that sobriety societies set up across the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had not been effective.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s main opposition party fired the editor of its newspaper Friday over an article saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> were involved in the bombing of a Korean jetliner last year. The action was taken after <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> expressed anger over the article, which quoted former South Korean Prime Minister <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chung-yul </PERSON> as saying the governments of those countries were behind the plane's disappearance. The <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 vanished off the coast of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> in November with 115 people aboard. Socialist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Tsuruo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON> on Thursday announced plans to retract the article and publish an apology on the front page of the paper's next edition, due out May 31. The article, which appeared in the party's semi-weekly <PERSON> Shakai </PERSON> <PERSON> Shimpo </PERSON> on Tuesday, quoted <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> as saying the plot was carried out to ensure the election in December of <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> as <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s president `` Following a party executive meeting this morning, the editor of the paper has been removed, and the reporter who wrote the article has been warned,'' said a party spokesman who commented on condition of anonymity. A member of the paper's editorial staff, who spoke on condition he not be further identified, refused to say why the report had not been more closely scrutinized prior to publication. He said that since the newspaper has no correspondents in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, `` there may have been limitations in translation.'' <PERSON> Issei </PERSON> <PERSON> Inoue </PERSON>, head of the party's international division, was called to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> on Friday to explain the incident after the South Korean government issued a formal protest late Thursday night, the spokesman said. `` The honor of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> people has been seriously harmed by the article,'' said South Korean Embassy minister <PERSON> Park </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryun </PERSON> in a statement delivered to the Japanese government Thursday afternoon. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has accused communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> of blowing up the plane in an effort to disrupt the Olympic Games in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has been demanding to be a co-host of the Games but denied involvement in the plane incident. A young woman who was a passenger on an early part of the flight was arrested and said she was an agent trained in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and had planted a bomb on the plane. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> disagrees with the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s friendly stance toward <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> The party in turn has refused to recognize a 1965 bilateral agreement normalizing <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s relations with the southern half of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. Though <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has no formal diplomatic ties with the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>, the Socialists and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> maintain good relations.

 Two women and a man forced their way into the home of a supermarket mogul Friday and shot him to death in front of his wife in what police said may have been a terrorist attack by Galician separatists. No group claimed responsibility immediately in the death of <PERSON> Claudio </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanmartin </PERSON>, 53, the chairman of two supermarket chains and former chairman of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s largest regional savings bank, <LOCATION> Caixa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Galicia </LOCATION>. Police speculated, however, that the assailants may belong to the <ORGANIZATION> Guerrilla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> of the Galician People, an obscure group seeking independence from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> for the northwestern region of <LOCATION> Galicia </LOCATION>. Hours earlier, a bomb explosion in <LOCATION> Perbes </LOCATION>, outside of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coruna </LOCATION>, destroyed the unoccupied summer home of <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraga </PERSON>, a Galician regional conservative leader, former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister and now a member of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. No one was hurt and no group claimed responsibility, police said. But the <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coruna </ORGANIZATION> civil governor, <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON>, said the explosives used were of the kind used in the past by the <ORGANIZATION> Guerrilla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> of the Galician People. <PERSON> Fraga </PERSON>, his wife and family were in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> where the politician has lived for decades. Police said the guerrilla group has carried out 10 attacks on high tension electric towers, bank offices, police cars and industries in the Galician region in the past eight months. <PERSON> Sanmartin </PERSON>'s wife told police a man and two women pretended to be delivering flowers to the family's second-floor apartment, then violently forced their way in. She said she called for help and her husband came to the front door, where the man shot him in the head and chest, officers reported. Police said neighbors told them the attackers then left and calmly drove away in a waiting car.

 The second fire to break out on an English Channel ferry this week damaged the engine room of the 3,355-ton European Trader on Friday but was quickly brought under control, officials said.

P and <ORGANIZATION> O </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ferries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> said the fire started before dawn, 20 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Dunkirk </LOCATION>, and filled the engine room with smoke. The company said the crew smothered the blaze with carbon dioxide before British firefighters and rescue workers arrived on <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> helicopters. The cause of the fire was not immediately determined, P and O said. The European Trader was the first vessel to break a 15-week-old strike on P and O's <LOCATION> Dover-Calais </LOCATION> route when it sailed to the French port on May 14.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday tighter restrictions on sightseeing flights over the Grand Canyon to reduce noise levels and improve safety. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said beginning next Sept. 22 sightseeing flights must remain outside four designated `` flight free'' zones and elsewhere fly at higher altitudes than before.

<HEAD>Economists Boost Growth Predictions, Still See Recession in 1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Economists for the nation's top businesses said Friday they had boosted their growth forecasts for 1988, but they still expect high interest rates to push the country into a recession sometime next year. The latest survey of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economists </ORGANIZATION> showed a substantial upward revision in growth estimates for this year compared with a survey done three months ago. The economists, who advise some of the country's largest corporations, said they were looking for the gross national product to expand 2.9 percent this year, which would match the performance turned in during 1986 and 1987. Three months ago, the economists forecast a much slower 2.2 percent GNP increase in 1988. The survey was taken in early May before the government released its revised estimate of economic growth for the first quarter. On Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the GNP rose at a robust annual rate of 3.9 percent from January through March. <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said if the survey were taken now, most economists would boost growth estimates even higher. Some analysts are predicting the economy could grow at a 4 percent rate this year, which would be the fastest growth since 1984. In the survey, the economists said the reason for the increased optimism was a belief that the country's trade deficit would show more improvement because of higher-than-expected growth in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports. The merchandise trade deficit, which hit a record $ 171 billion last year, was predicted to shrink to $ 150 billion this year, a drop of 12 percent. This is only slightly less optimistic than the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's projection that the trade deficit will decline by 15 percent this year. The economists predicted the boom in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export sales would help push industrial production up a strong 4.5 percent this year. However, the economists expressed concerns that the rapid growth in foreign demand, coupled with continued high consumer spending in this country, would contribute to inflationary pressures and prompt the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to step in with higher interest rates to cool off the economy. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> already has tightened credit conditions twice in the past two months, driving up a variety of interest rates, including the prime rate and mortgage rates. Fixed-rate mortgages rose to 10.58 percent this past week, the highest level since the first of the year, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday. `` We see inflation coming it at 5 percent this year. That will cause the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to tighten up and push interest rates up,'' Ms. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. `` Higher interest rates are normally the way we get into recessions in this country.'' The survey found that a majority of the economists, 57.8 percent, believed the lengthy economic expansion, now in its sixth year, will end with a recession beginning in 1989. On other issues, the survey of 58 business economists who regularly make forecasts for their own companies found: _ Consumer prices will rise by 4.3 percent in 1988, but the inflation rate will jump to 5 percent in 1989 _ The federal budget deficit, which fell to $ 148.9 billion in the 1987 fiscal year, will edge up slightly to $ 155 billion in the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30 _ Corporate profits will surge by 9.1 percent this year, even better than the 8.7 percent profit increase of 1987

 The government has begun a safety investigation into alleged failures in electrically powered front seats in 1985 and 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> and Dodge automobiles, the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> was prompted by 132 complaints about the operation of the automatic seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LeBaron </ORGANIZATION>, Laser and New Yorker; <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> 600, <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> and Lancer; and <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caravelle </ORGANIZATION>. The government said the complaints included seven accidents resulting in three injuries. In all, 195,000 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> cars have seats that potentially could fail, <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said. The agency said a failure in the seat could cause a reduction in seat strength and increase the likelihood of injury in a rear-impact crash or cause the seat to recline rearward, resulting in a driver losing control of the car. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` is aware of the two failure modes and has taken action to correct them, but has not conducted a safety recall.'' The automaker has strengthened the frame of the power seat and seat adjuster in later model cars, the agency said.

 Two elementary school teachers gave their students a lesson in love Friday, saying their wedding vows in a classroom surrounded by the 50 children who helped bring them together. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, a fifth-grade teacher at <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Kamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Britvec </PERSON>, who teaches first grade, tied the knot in her homeroom as their students read poetry and sang during the ceremony. The pair met last spring during a school outing shortly after <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> joined the faculty. `` We hear kids talk about divorce and bad relationships, and we wanted to show them how a good relationship develops over time,'' said <PERSON> Britvec </PERSON>, 25. <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, 30, said his students thought he was joking when he told them the wedding would be at school _ during school hours. `` The kids have been in on this relationship since day one,'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said after the wedding. So much so that some of the students took credit for the marriage, the first for both the bride and groom. `` If it was n't for us, they would n't even be together,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Potts </PERSON>, 11, one of <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>'s fifth-graders. `` We told him how to ask her out. He was too scared.'' The students helped decorate the classroom and halls of the 475-pupil school in this small town near the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> border with multi-colored streamers, paper flowers, wedding bells and congratulatory signs. During the wedding, Mrs. <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>'s first-graders read a poem they had written that included the verse, `` We feel good about love.'' After the ceremony, which was performed by Mayor <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Easterday </PERSON>, the children gave the <ORGANIZATION> Petersons </ORGANIZATION> a quilt with panels on which they had drawn pictures. Some first graders had a few qualms about the proceedings. `` This is mushy,'' said 7-year-old <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>. But he brightened up and added, `` I'll bet the cake will be good.'' The kids got a break from afternoon classes for the wedding, but <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Arend </PERSON> said he was sure their education did n't suffer. `` Who's to say where children learn the most, from a math book or from some real life experience life a marriage ceremony?'' he said. The couple said their students were the first to know of their April 1 engagement. And the students' interest in this classroom romance does n't look like stopping with the wedding. `` They're already asking when we'll have a baby,'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said. `` But we want to show them that in real life you do n't have to have a family besides just the two of you.''

 A black Cuban refugee jailed more than two years on a murder charge despite two witnesses' testimony that the killer was white has been released, ending an ordeal he said was `` not supposed to happen in this country.'' At one point prosecutors had said they would seek the death penalty for <PERSON> Rigoberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Alberja </PERSON>, 32, indicted for first-degree murder in the 1982 shooting of a patron at an Allapattah bar during a holdup. <PERSON> Alberja </PERSON> was arrested in January 1986 on the tip of a police informant even though the bar's two owners said the killer was white and had straight hair. <PERSON> Alberja </PERSON> always maintained his innocence and refused offers to plea bargain. Earlier this month, the state finally conceded it could not prove its case, and <PERSON> Alberja </PERSON> was released. `` It's unbelievable,'' said <PERSON> Alberja </PERSON>'s public defender, <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. `` If all you got is two witnesses saying the guy was Caucasian and you arrest a guy who is n't Caucasian, well then maybe you better think you got the wrong guy.'' <PERSON> Alberja </PERSON> said Thursday he had never been arrested before the murder case, and was stunned by the treatment he got from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` It is a great injustice,'' said <PERSON> Alberja </PERSON>. `` This happens in other countries, but it's not supposed to happen in this country.'' <PERSON> Alberja </PERSON> said that during his time awaiting trial in the <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>, he was stabbed six times by another inmate. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, those accused of first-degree murder are automatically jailed without bond pending trial. Prosecutor <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornely </PERSON> defended his case despite the identification problems. He said lengthy appeals over pre-trial motions hampered his efforts. `` We had other information, a confidential informant and certain other witnesses who knew something,'' said <PERSON> Cornely </PERSON>. `` But by the time the appeal was done, a lot had dried up.'' None of the five robbery victims at the bar could be located, he said. He shrugged off the the discrepancy over <PERSON> Alberja </PERSON>'s race. At the time of the robbery, bar owners <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Liles </PERSON> helped sketch a picture of the suspect, who they said was white. But after the tip from the informant almost four years later, investigators called in <LOCATION> Liles </LOCATION>, and he identified <PERSON> Alberja </PERSON> from a photo lineup. `` I do n't know what <PERSON> Liles </PERSON>' thinking was at first,'' said <PERSON> Cornely </PERSON>. `` Maybe the lighting in the bar made him think the suspect was white, but that's just a maybe.'' But <PERSON> Cornely </PERSON> acknowledged that <PERSON> Liles </PERSON>' change of testimony _ and a judge's decision to throw out the photo identification _ made his case impossible. `` His ID alone would not fly,'' said the prosecutor. `` We need other witnesses, and those witnesses disappeared.''

 Watching `` Bullwinkle'' head into the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> on Friday brought tears to the eyes of some who worked on the colossal offshore drilling platform that will be taller than <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s landmark Sears Tower. `` We've worked hard for three years, and an event like this can be somewhat emotional,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Offshore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s project manager for Bullwinkle. `` There were a few tears watching it go by.'' After the 1,368-foot, 50,000-ton Bullwinkle settles on the ocean floor off the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> coast, workers will install a deck and two drilling rigs, bringing the leviathan's weight to 78,000 tons and its height to 1,615 feet. `` That compares to the world's tallest building, which is the <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>, which is about 1,450 feet,'' <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON> said. The tallest drilling platform is the 1,132-foot <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cognac </ORGANIZATION> platform, installed off the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> coast in 1976. Spectators lined the ship channel at <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aransas </LOCATION> on Friday to see the Bullwinkle off, and police had to direct traffic. Even lying on its side, it had no trouble dwarfing everything in sight. `` I made a trip up from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Padre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> to watch Bullwinkle go out,'' <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> McSpadden </PERSON> said. `` I used to live in this town and I've followed its progress since its inception.'' Sterling has been in charge of the Bullwinkle project during three years of construction at the <LOCATION> Ingleside </LOCATION> yard of Gulf Marine Fabricators, which <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> contracted for construction, transportation and installation. `` We wish we were building another one right now, wish we had another one to start just as big as it or bigger,'' <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON> Myron </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodrigue </PERSON> said after watching nine tugboats pull the barge carrying the huge steel drilling jacket through the <ORGANIZATION> Corpus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION>. At the project's peak, 700 people were employed in building the structure at <LOCATION> Ingleside </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rodrigue </PERSON> said. Shell estimates the total cost of the Bullwinkle project at $ 500 million, including construction, installation and related expenses. The company would not specify how much the structure itself cost. The Bullwinkle, with a base measuring 4 -LCB- acres, has been a fixture on the horizon during its development, visible for several miles on the flat coastal plain in the <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION> area. Traffic on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway was diverted at the beginning of May to prepare for loading the platform onto a specially built barge that measures 853 feet long, 207 feet wide and 49 feet deep. It is expected to take about three days to pull the structure 380 miles to its destination about 150 miles southwest of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. The base will be flooded to bring the drilling jacket to rest in 1,353 feet of water in <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION> lease, with installation expected to take about three months. Twenty-eight pilings for Bullwinkle will be driven 400 feet into the sea floor and secured with cement. Bullwinkle is designed to withstand at least a 72-foot hurricane wave, with the ability to sway more than 6 feet without stress damage. <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> estimates that production will begin in the first quarter of 1989, and will eventually put out 50,000 barrels of oil and 90 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. The Bullwinkle project was conceived nearly five years ago, when oil was well above $ 20 a barrel, <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON> said. `` Even today at $ 15 it's a -LRB- profitable -RRB- venture,'' he said, but added he will not brag until Bullwinkle is in place and producing. `` Bullwinkle'' was a code name given to the project when <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> was bidding for the Green Canyon underwater site.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Friday ratified, 93-5, a treaty to abolish medium-range nuclear missiles, enabling President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to present the pact to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at their <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit next week. It was the first major U.S.-Soviet arms control accord ratified by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> since 1972. Leading up to the ratification vote, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected four minor amendments offered by Republicans. That brought to 14 the number of amendments proposed by <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> conservatives and rejected during two weeks of floor consideration of the treaty. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s consent to ratification, which required a two-third majority, had long been assured because only a handful of conservatives opposed the pact. Senators voting against the treaty were Republicans <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and Democrat <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Sens. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, did not vote Spectators crowded into galleries overlooking the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor gave a standing ovation after the vote tally was announced. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and GOP Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., quickly informed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> of the outcome in a telephone call to <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, where the president was resting in advance of The two leaders accepted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s invitation to come to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> next Tuesday to witness the exchange of treaty documents. The White House said presidential chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> would fly to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to deliver the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ratification materials Sunday. In a statement issued by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the president said he was `` very pleased'' by the vote, which `` clearly shows support for our arms reduction objectives.'' He added, however: `` I continue to have concerns about the constitutionality of some provisions of the resolution of ratification, particularly those dealing with interpretation, and I will communicate with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on these matters in due course.'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, `` Bless your heart. We're just delighted that we're going to send you a treaty and it was almost a unanimous vote ... we'll have a little blue ribbon tied around it.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> told the president, `` We are very pleased to be able to give you this -LRB- ratification -RRB- in advance of your stepping on Soviet territory in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed the pact Dec. 8 at their summit meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and the administration had pushed for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action before the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit. Administration officials also waged a successful fight to win <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval without so-called `` killer amendments'' that would have required U.S.-Soviet negotiations to be reopened. Conservative Republican critics mounted several attacks, but all their attempts were easily turned back. The only major change was a Democratic-backed amendment to the ratification resolution, barring future administrations from changing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interpretation of the treaty without prior <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval. That arose from a fight with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> over the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the last arms pact to win <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ratification. The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces or INF treaty provides for the elimination within three years of all medium-range missiles with a range of 300 miles to 3,400 miles. The Soviets would destroy 1,752 missiles while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would eliminate 867, including both deployed and non-deployed weapons. The INF pact is the first in the 40-year history of U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms control to require the actual destruction of weapons. Other accords simply slowed the buildup of each side's vast nuclear arsenals. In addition, the treaty includes the most intrusive and stringent verification procedures in arms control history. The key verification feature provides on-site inspection, both on a regular basis and through challenges by each side. Elimination of the medium-range missiles still will leave thousands of nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has about 4,300 short-range atomic weapons of various kinds in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, while <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> have their own nuclear arsenals. While the pact will only provide for reductions of about 3 percent in each side's arsenal, administration and congressional supporters say they hope it will be a blueprint for a more far-reaching treaty reducing long-range weapons. That proposed pact, known as the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty -LRB- START -RRB-, is the subject of ongoing U.S.-Soviet negotiations and is likely to be a key topic at the Reagan-Gorbachev summit. Both sides are still far apart on the proposed START treaty, and one of the main sticking point is how to verify it. On-site inspections would have to be even more far-reaching than those in the INF Treaty. In addition to serving as a first major step to START, the INF Treaty should also prod the 16-member <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to improve its array of conventional weapons, supporters argued during the congressional debate. `` INF is a beginning, not an end,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> was referring to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s need to improve its conventional defenses. The Soviets and their <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> allies outnumber <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> in a variety of numerical categories of weapons, including tanks and artillery pieces. The INF pact was hailed as `` <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s finest hour'' by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, a theme restated often during <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> consideration of the accord. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was referring to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to go ahead with the 1983 deployments of the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear weapons, despite strong protests in some <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations, particularly <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Those deployments were considered the key to the final agreement.

<TEXT>
 Striking TV and movie scriptwriters will resume work for more than 70 producers, including makers of the top-rated `` The Cosby Show,'' under independent contracts approved by the writers' union Friday. The independent contracts were approved by 86 percent of the 2,016 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> who voted Thursday night in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said union spokeswoman <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON>. The producers' bargaining group, the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION>, dismissed the defections of the mostly small production companies as an insignificant episode in the 12-week strike, which has forced delays in the start of the fall television season. By Friday noon, a union list of producers who had signed included <ORGANIZATION> Carsey-Werner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which makes `` Cosby,'' and the makers of `` The Tonight Show Starring <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>,'' `` Highway to Heaven'' and `` It's <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shandling </PERSON>'s Show.'' Alliance spokesman <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> estimated the independent contracts, which accede to writers' key pay demands, cover just 1 percent of the union's 3,000 working members, and none of the big production companies that form the backbone of the industry group. `` It had virtually no impact on prime-time network -LRB- programs -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said of the vote. `` Not one alliance member is in this group,'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said of the producers who had signed on. `` They voted to put 72 writers to work ... we're concerned with getting 3,000 writers back to work.'' Many of those who signed were one-person writer-producer companies, and some listed make TV shows that have been canceled, including the <ORGANIZATION> Smothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>' comedy show and `` Days and Nights of <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said. But Ms. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> termed the defections a symbolic victory as well as a break in management ranks. `` We're very, very pleased,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said. `` The significant thing is that upwards of 70 companies ... feel they can do profitable business under a contract that also respects the needs of writers.'' The three-year contract accepts the writers key demand: Retention of the present formula for the payments, known as residuals, which writers get for reruns of one-hour television shows. Citing the increasing difficulty in selling such shows for rerun, the producers are seeking to link the amount of the residual payments to a show's success in rerun, or syndication as it is known in the industry. The contract also boosts residual payments for use of the writers' work overseas and tightens requirements that writers be consulted about script changes made during filming. The union contract also boosts minimum pay scales for writers. The writers walked out March 7, and until this week, only one bargaining session was held. Talks Wednesday at the producers' headquarters in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' <LOCATION> Sherman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION> district failed to make progress The negotiators agreed to resume formal talks Tuesday under the guidance of a federal mediator, and small groups were scheduled to hold preliminary discussions Saturday.

The man said police refrained from interfering and even cleared the way for marchers through car-congested streets from downtown <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> to the embassy in the foreign diplomats' central district. The marcher, who spoke on condition of anonymity, called it an unusual sign of police cooperation with the young members of the unofficial <ORGANIZATION> Danube </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circle </ORGANIZATION> ecological group. In another departure, state-run television ran, without comment, a one-minute film segment on its main evening newscast showing protesters arriving at the embassy. Among them was biologist <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Varga </PERSON>, a leader of the ecologists. The marchers carried placards and banners demanding a halt to the project, a joint venture involving hydropower installations on the <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Gabcikovo </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and at Nagymaros. Banners read `` We Want Clear Water,'' `` No Dams'' and `` We Want Our Danube.'' Hungarian and Austrian ecologists have said that damming up the <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION> water and slowing its flow will threaten drinking water reserves of millions of Hungarians and destroy large areas of riverside forestland in both <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechsolovakia </LOCATION>. The protester said demonstrators were met with applause and cheers from passers-by on the march to the embassy. Under an Austrian-Hungarian contract signed on May 29, 1986, 70 percent of the construction work $ 483 million will be carried out by Austrian companies. A delegation of four was allowed to enter the embassy to hand over a resolution protesting <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s financial participation, <ORGANIZATION> Austria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. It said the Austrian ambassador was not there but promised the protesters by telephone a written reply to their plea. The first turbine of the Nagymaros station is to go into operation in 1990. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> will repay construction costs by supplying <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> with electricity for 20 years, starting in 1996.

 <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, former Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> cultural affairs commissioner, was arrested Friday and charged with trying to shoplift $ 44 in merchandise from a department store. Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> appeared before District Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON> and was released on $ 150 cash bail. The 63-year-old <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> resident, already facing federal fraud and bribery-related charges, contested <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Williamsport </LOCATION> police allegations that she tried to leave <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION> with six bottles of nail polish, five pairs of earrings, shoes and flashlight batteries in her purse and shopping bag. `` I was leaving the store to lock my car and come back and pay for the merchandise,'' she told the magistrate. She said she would pay her fine and costs `` under protest'' through the mail, if court documents affirm her contention that this is her first such offense. The maximum penalty, according to the court, would be a $ 300 fine. `` If true, it's extraordinarily sad that this could have occurred,'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said of the charge. Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> was his campaign manager in 1977 when <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> was first elected mayor. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month quoted unidentified sources and records as saying Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> was charged in 1970 with shoplifting from a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> department store. The newspaper said she left <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> without taking care of the charge and paid a fine of no more than $ 100 in 1987 to end the case. The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said it could not determine what was stolen. Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> was indicted by a federal grand jury last October on charges she tried to influence the judge handling the divorce case of her reported lover, millionaire <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>. <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>, serving time at nearby <LOCATION> Allenwood </LOCATION> Federal Prison Camp for tax evasion, also was indicted in the case. The two are scheduled to go on trial Sept. 14. Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> asked at Friday's arraignment whether her arrest must be publicized. When told it would be published, she retorted, `` So be it.'' She was escorted from the hearing room to her car by police. Should she contest Friday's retail theft charge, she faces a June 27 preliminary hearing before District Justice <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON>.

 A pair of top Soviet economists on Friday said progressive taxes on small businesses are an example of bureaucratic meddling that will discourage growth of consumer goods and services. <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aganbegyan </PERSON>, an economist close to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, told reporters the progressive taxes as high as 90 percent were `` adopted behind closed doors'' by the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. `` Some provisions are faulty. They did n't know much about progressive taxation,'' he said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said the cooperatives _ employee-owned small businesses _ are a key element of his plans to improve the supply of goods and services to consumers, who face widespread shortages in the state-run economy. The Supreme Soviet, the country's nominal parliament, on Thursday passed a law expanding the rights of the cooperatives to compete with the inefficient state-run economy. And in a rare move, the body also expanded the rights of local government to give tax breaks to preferred kinds of cooperatives and directed that the progressive tax structure decreed April 1 by the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> be rewritten. The Supreme Soviet normally only rubber stamps legislation that already has been approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the dominant force in Soviet society. <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Shmelev </PERSON>, an economist with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A.-Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said the tax rates decreed by the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> apparently will remain in effect until they can be rewritten Tax rates for workers at cooperatives are 27 percent on a monthly income of $ 1,600 and 53.5 percent on an income of $ 3,200. The government has not said what income would be affected by the maximum 90 percent tax. The average industrial worker earns about $ 320 a month. Workers in the state sector pay a flat 13 percent tax if they earn more than $ 480 a month. `` I think this law on progressive taxation on cooperatives is very bad. It puts obstacles in the way of development of cooperatives,'' <PERSON> Shmelev </PERSON> said. He said the debate in the Supreme Soviet was an encouraging sign of life in that body. <PERSON> Aganbegyan </PERSON> said the tax rates probably would be on the books for a year or more before they could be amended. Eventually, he said a uniform progressive tax rate should be developed for those who work in cooperatives and those who for state-run enterprises. The law approved Thursday by the Supreme Soviet legally puts cooperatives on an equal footing with state-run enterprises. It ensures that cooperative property may not be seized by the state, allows cooperatives to own buildings and other property not including land, and them to conduct business with overseas companies and earn hard currency.

 The attorney for a woman who contracted AIDS through a 1983 blood transfusion told a jury Friday that the blood bank failed to screen donors properly and the doctors who saw her later treated her like `` a medical yo-yo.'' <PERSON> Susie </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>, 50, of <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON>, and her husband, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>, 53, are suing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, whose blood bank in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, supplied the contaminated plasma; their former family doctor, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Merritt </PERSON>; and Dr. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kearns </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> infectious disease expert who first tested Mrs. <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> for exposure to the virus that causes AIDS. Lawyers have said the case may be the first case in the nation in which a jury will decide an AIDS victim's claim against a blood bank. In a 1986 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> case, a jury was chosen but the lawsuit was settled out of court before the trial ended. After closing arguments wind up, District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coughlin </PERSON> said, he would allow the six-member jury to decide whether to recess for the holiday weekend or begin deliberations Saturday. The trial began three weeks ago. Mrs. <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Reidy </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> UBS </ORGANIZATION> and the doctors were uninformed and insensitive to the physical and emotional needs of their patient. <ORGANIZATION> UBS </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Irish </PERSON> said the jury must judge the defendants on the acceptable standards of care at the time <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> received the transfusion, arguing that a test to detect AIDS virus in donated blood did not exist in 1983. He cautioned the jury that <ORGANIZATION> UBS </ORGANIZATION>' actions `` can not be judged by you using wisdom gained from hindsight.'' Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a disease that attacks the body's immune system. It is transmitted through sexual contact or contact with an infected person's blood or bodily fluids. Mrs. <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> received the deadly virus in a 1983 blood transfusion at <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cortez </LOCATION> during treatment for an accidental self-inflicted gunshot wound. The other two defendants, the two doctors, were accused of failing to properly diagnose or counsel her later. `` <PERSON> Susie </PERSON> was lonely, abandoned and scared and was a medical yo-yo betwen Dr. <PERSON> Merritt </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Kearns </PERSON>, who said, ` You do have it, you do n't have it, you do have it,''' <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> said. `` That was in the spring of 1986, when they knew she had two positive test results.'' <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> said the doctors were also negligent in failing to explain to the couple what precautions they should have taken to prevent transmission of the disease. Although the couple testified they had sexual relations following the tests, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> has tested negative for the AIDS virus. Though <ORGANIZATION> UBS </ORGANIZATION> argued that the AIDS blood test became available only in 1985, <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> said the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> said in December 1982 that AIDS transmission was linked to homosexual and bisexual men and to blood transfusions. The blood bank had options to screen donors, such as direct questioning or physical examinations, <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> argued. `` United Blood Services chose d -RRB-, none of the above,'' he said. The lawsuit did n't specify the amount of damages sought, but <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> suggested the jury award damages of mroe than $ 13 million. Irish said in closing arguments that the defendants were sympathetic, and regret that she contracted AIDS from the transfusion. `` But the plaintiffs are not asking for our sympathy,'' Irish said. `` They are here to ask you to move a bag of money _ maybe $ 13 million, maybe more _ from this table to that table.'' Irish said the only person who can be blamed is the donor, who has admitted to carrying the AIDS virus. `` We are not liable for that man's conduct,'' Irish said.

 The government of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> has pardoned imprisoned <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillo </PERSON>, state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> L'Humanite </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Guillo </PERSON> would be freed Saturday. Guillo, a freelancer, was arrested while filming the Afghan war in northern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> last September. He was convicted in January of spying and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, quoted Afghan President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> as saying <PERSON> Guillo </PERSON> was pardoned in view of `` the old friendship between <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' He said it was also in view of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords signed April 14 to withdraw more than 100,000 Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Soviet troops entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 and helped the Marxist government fight U.S.-backed Moslem rebels. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> signed the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> announced the pardon after <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Perol </PERSON>, secretary general of the French External Affairs Ministry, met with <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, the newscast said. <PERSON> Perol </PERSON> delivered a personal message from <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, it said. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Fornier </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, could not confirm the reports that Guillo would be freed Saturday. `` Certainly it will be in the next two to three days,'' <PERSON> Fornier </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Guillo </PERSON> has shared a prison cell in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> Fausto </PERSON> <PERSON> Biloslavo </PERSON>, who is serving a similar sentence, but there was no word on whether <PERSON> Biloslavo </PERSON> would be released. Western diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they expected Biloslavo's release soon because <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> is trying to polish his government's image during the Soviet troop withdrawal.

<HEAD>Army Speeds Plan to Shield Helicopters Against Radio Wave
Interference</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Army has decided to accelerate plans to shield a key control unit in the UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter against radio wave interference after a test incident earlier this month in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, a spokesman said Friday. The May 11 incident, in which a Blackhawk flying near a huge antenna farm banked into a right-hand turn for five seconds without any pilot commands, also has prompted the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> to instruct its pilots to keep clear of a handful of radio antenna installations in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Although the May 11 incident has raised new concerns about the effects of so-called electromagnetic interference on the Blackhawk, extensive testing has convinced the service it is still dealing with a `` nuisance'' problem and not a phenomenon that affects flight safety, said Maj. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Soucy </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` We certainly are not going to ground the fleet, because there's no reason to do so,'' <PERSON> Soucy </PERSON> added. But <PERSON> Soucy </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> intends to accelerate its plans to add shielding to the electronic controls on the craft's hydraulic control system because of the test results. The service already had opened talks with the helicopter's manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION> Sikorsky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION>, on shielding a number of electronic components `` because our pilots should n't have to worry about nuisance'' signal interference, <PERSON> Soucy </PERSON> said. Last November, <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> reported investigators were convinced radio wave interference had caused five Blackhawk accidents since 1982, killing 22 servicemen. `` Radio waves in the air can penetrate the helicopter's wiring and electrical components and generate false commands that can range from simply causing the craft's warning lights to flash to sending it into a fatal dive,'' the report said. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Sikorsky </PERSON>, a subsidiary of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, adamantly disputed that report, saying there was no evidence electromagnetic interference had caused any crashes. The service had acknowledged earlier that radio wave interference could cause `` uncommanded control inputs,'' moving the helicopter's horizontal stabilator slightly, but not to the extent of posing a flight safety hazard. There is a switch in the cockpit that allows a pilot to assume manual control of the stabilator, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> says. Last month, a Blackhawk operating near a large array of high-intensity antennas in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> experienced some unusual blinking lights and alarm horns, <PERSON> Soucy </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> then attempted to replicate that incident with special instruments and test pilots. On May 11, during a test, `` the aircraft turned to the right on its own for about five seconds while flying near the antenna farm,'' <PERSON> Soucy </PERSON> said. `` We believe the hydraulic logic module inside the Blackhawk was being affected.'' The spokesman declined to say how close the helicopter was flying to the antenna farm, but said it was transmitting with a combined power in excess of 400 million watts of power. While the test suggests that large levels of electromagnetic interference actually can affect the controls of the Blackhawk, `` the effect is very brief'' and does n't pose a threat of losing control of the copter, <PERSON> Soucy </PERSON> said. The Blackhawk is a twin-engine, single-rotor helicopter that is replacing the aging UH-1 <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> copters of the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> era as the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s primary air assault and air cavalry craft. It was introduced in April 1981. The Army currently has more than 900 <ORGANIZATION> Blackhawks </ORGANIZATION> in its inventory and plans to buy about 1,700 of the choppers. Each craft costs roughly $ 6 million.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official said Friday the Arab nations are not giving Palestinians the political and financial support they need to continue the 6-month-old uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories. <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> said the guerrilla movement will demand clear stands on the Palestinian issue from all governments during the Arab summit that begins June 7 in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s capital. `` The <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> summit will be the purgatory through which everyone will have to pass,'' said <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, media advister to <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. He made the comments in an article in the London-based newsletter Mideast Mirror. A copy was telexed to The Associated Press in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>. `` The question that will be asked both in private and in public will be: ` Who among you supports the establishment of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state and who opposes it?','' he said. `` There will be no room for double talk or half-baked positions.'' All Arab governments express public support for creation of a Palestinian state, but hardliners often accuse pro-Western moderates of avoiding conflict with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> policy. The American plan, promoted in trips to the region by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, proposes limited self-rule for the 1.5 million Palestinians of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. As of Friday, 198 Palestinians and two Israelis had died in violence in the occupied territories since the unrest began Dec. 8. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> claimed the summit had been delayed because of a `` tug of war'' behind the scenes between moderates and hardliners over the Palestinian issue. He said President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> took the initiative to call for the summit because of `` a justified belief that <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> officialdom was guilty of dereliction of duty toward the Palestinian uprising in the occupied land.'' <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> felt <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> `` not only withheld financial support to the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> but also kept them under political siege,'' he wrote. He argued that the Palestinian uprising had succeeded in putting the latest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace initiative `` in a vicious circle'' despite the support of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s `` allies'' in the region. He did not name the allies. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> claimed the purpose of the current trip to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, was to press for `` starving the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> of funds'' in order to hamper its support for the uprising.

 Democratic front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will try to resolve his differences with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> before the party's July nominating convention, aides say, but will not give in to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s demands for cuts in defense spending and higher taxes on the wealthy <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides, careful not to criticize the civil rights leader, point out that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will likely secure the nomination when the primary season concludes on June 7 and thus will be negotiating with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> from a position of strength. They said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will not make concessions that could hurt his chances against certain <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Our negotiating position will be very strong,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> said in an interview Thursday. `` Our ultimate goal is to resolve our differences as much as we can. But we're not going to negotiate our basic stands. You're not going to see any kind of fundamental shifts.'' On the stump, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> contends he is swaying <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` He is adjusting to a new agenda,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> rally on Thursday. But in reality, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has rejected many <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> proposals, including his calls for defense cuts and higher taxes for the wealthy and large corporations. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides also say a national health insurance proposal espoused by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is far more expensive than an employer-funded program backed by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who also has rejected <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s call for spending $ 2.5 billion to improve education programs. `` We simply do n't feel there is the money there to spend,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> issues adviser <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>. For now, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides say they will confine the public debate over Dukakis-Jackson differences to public statements of the candidates and ongoing discussions over the convention platform. `` We hope they will reach as many agreements as they can and when that process is further along it will be time to go back see where our differences are,'' <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> said. `` We're very comfortable that we will be at the convention with a very clear working majority.'' While the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign hopes to avoid public feuding or a fallout with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, it is at the same time sending subtle signals to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and expanding its outreach to black voters in case <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> refuses to support <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Up to 100 black <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporters from across the country are scheduled to meet in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> on Monday to discuss a fall strategy. `` I hope everybody has the same sense heading into this convention,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> said when asked about potential conflicts with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` There is a real sense that we Democrats can win. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has real vulnerabilities. `` We Democrats, if we do n't shoot ourselves in the foot, can win and I do n't think there is anybody in our party who wants to wake up the day after the election and have it said that if it was n't for him we would have won. <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> convention manager <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> this week and speaks frequently with her counterpart in the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>. She refuses to discuss the substance of the talks. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> convention manager <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> also has scheduled meetings with <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, and the candidates themselves met privately Wednesday following a debate in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` Would I like to see a peaceful convention? Yes,'' <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> said. `` But there are lots of negotiations that need to take place.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, in a telephone interview Friday, said: `` There might be some items that compromise can not be found on. But I'm not prepared to say what our priority issues will be. ... There have not been any substantive conversations on platform issues.'' He disputed the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides' boast about negotiating strength. `` We do n't expect that anyone will have a nominating majority of the delegates when we go into the convention,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. Despite that position, it appears very likely <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will have the 2,081 delegates needed for nomination. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides insist their convention planning is just beginning but say <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will have a major role. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp also is expected to seek to appease <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> by agreeing to a strong statement denouncing apartheid in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and supporting sanctions against the country, although it is unclear whether <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wants such a statement as part of the platform or whether he will agree with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s demand that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> be designated a terrorist state. `` There are significant differences and they represent real policy disagreements,'' <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> said. `` But they trust each other and they share a common goal. ... We want his support. It's obviously critical support.''

 The High Court refused requests Friday to release three people held under the Internal Security Act after they were charged with being Marxist conspirators against the government. Justice <PERSON> Lai </PERSON> <PERSON> Kew </PERSON> <PERSON> Chai </PERSON> said Home Minister <PERSON> Shanmugam </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayakumar </PERSON> had acted properly in authorizing the detentions of <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Souza </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> <PERSON> Souk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chng </PERSON> <PERSON> Suan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tze </PERSON>, and that there was no evidence of bad faith. They were arrested last year and released soon afterward, but picked up again April 19. The Internal Security Act allows the government to detain a person without trial for two years, renewable indefinitely. In a statement issued April 18, the day before the second arrest, all three said they were forced to confess and were mistreated in detention. They denied being Marxist conspirators. Officials have not given reasons for rearresting them, but said their statement `` was a political propaganda ploy to discredit the government.''

<TEXT>
 A 31-year-old man was sentenced to death Friday for the kidnapping and murder of a businessman who was buried alive last September and suffocated before his family could pay a $ 1 million ransom. Jurors deliberated less than an hour before voting death for <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> of <PERSON> Bourbonnais </PERSON>, who was convicted Monday in <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Small </PERSON>'s death. He showed no emotion when the penalty was announced about 5:30 p.m. Prosecutor <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Nowicki </PERSON> told jurors that <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>' cruelty demanded the death penalty, and asked jurors if they could imagine `` a worse way to die,'' as he stood before the homemade wooden box in which Small's body was found. `` Imagine <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Small </PERSON> when that lid closed ... his life coming to an end,'' <PERSON> Nowicki </PERSON> said. `` Imagine the panic he felt, the helplessness ... to claw, to scrape, to scratch.'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>' live-in girlfriend, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rish </PERSON>, 26, also is charged with murder and kidnapping and is awaiting trial. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>' execution date would be set at a hearing later Members of Small's family, including his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, were immediately escorted from the packed courtroom. The jury, which had been selected in <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION> because of pre-trial publicity in <LOCATION> Kankakee </LOCATION>, also was escorted from the courtroom. Police said jurors did not want to talk with reporters. Small, 40, was lured from his home Sept. 2, 1987, and calls demanding a $ 1 million ransom were made to his family. But the family could not understand the tape-recorded instructions for delivering the cash. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Rish </PERSON> were arrested two days later, the same day police dug up Small's body from the box in which he was buried in woods near <LOCATION> Kankakee </LOCATION>. Defense attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said there was `` some character'' in <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> and asked the jury to spare his life. `` <PERSON> Danny </PERSON>'s not doing it to himself. You have to go back there and take a pen in hand and sign'' the penalty, he said. During the death penalty hearing that began Wednesday, prosecutors presented witnesses who described <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>' use and sale of drugs, and a letter he wrote to Mrs. Small and had smuggled out of the county jail. It expressed `` condolences'' and said Small was not meant to die, but demanded the Small family pay `` a blood debt.'' The jurors convicted <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> after listening chilling tape-recordings of Small saying his kidnapper had put him in a `` grave'' where he would die unless the ransom was paid quickly. `` I ai n't coming back to dig you back up,'' Small's kidnapper was heard telling him on the tape, `` ... and it's gon na get real stuffy in here.'' Small was the great-grandson of former Illinois Gov. <PERSON> Len </PERSON> <PERSON> Small </PERSON>. He was former vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Mid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION>, a group that owned radio and cable television stations, until the company was sold in 1986.

 A three-judge panel on this southern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island on Friday ordered a Colombian man extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on cocaine trafficking charges. <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Triana </PERSON> <PERSON> Murillo </PERSON>, arrested May 16 and held at the request of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, was put aboard a private plane following his two-hour appearance in court, officials said in the capital. Chief of Police <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> refused to disclose the plane's destination, citing security reasons But <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Keheo </PERSON>, assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview that <PERSON> Triana </PERSON> was being taken to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>. Prosecutor <PERSON> Florencio </PERSON> <PERSON> Wernet </PERSON> told the judges <PERSON> Triana </PERSON> was indicted by a grand jury in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug charges. <PERSON> Keheo </PERSON> said <PERSON> Triana </PERSON>, 37, faces charges involving the smuggling of cocaine between 1980 and 1984. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Triana </PERSON> `` is a fugitive out of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Triana </PERSON>, who argued his arrest was a case of mistaken identity, was held under tight security on this self-governing member of the Kingdom of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, located in the lower <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> about 20 miles off the coast of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Triana </PERSON> told the three judges he exported automobile parts from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. `` I am innocent,'' he said. `` My misfortune was being born in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>.'' He left the courtroom in tears. <PERSON> Triana </PERSON>'s lawyers said the man the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> really wants is <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Triana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, not their client. The judges, who had deliberated several hours, recommended to Gov. <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Tromp </PERSON> that there was sufficient evidence to extradite. No <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials attended the hearing. While <PERSON> Triana </PERSON> was taken to court, Dutch soldiers were positioned at the prison and a nearby school was closed. The frigate <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinsbergen </PERSON> patrolled the seas off the island.

 Democratic presidential front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Friday the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration `` ca n't say no to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' and he said the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> once was `` paying off'' <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military leader to the tune of $ 200,000 a year. `` We've been paying that guy what we pay the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` You ca n't be serious about waging a real war against drugs when we have an administration that ca n't say no to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' he said, referring to Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment on drug charges. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor hammered away at the issue of drugs and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy as he campaigned across the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> on a trip designed to close out the Democratic primary season on a winning note and begin pointing the party toward the fall campaign. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> holds its primary on June 7 and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is expected to win enough <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> delegates here and in primaries the same day in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> to clinch the party's nomination over <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, too, was campaigning in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> on Friday, and the two Democrats met briefly at the <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> airport. They emerged smiling from a private session that lasted about five minutes. Aides would not discuss what they had said. From <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, where he addressed a meeting of Democratic women and then spoke before a sun-drenched outdoor rally, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> headed for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where he attended a barbeque with the state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> hierarchy in a continuation of the attempt to pull the party together at the end of the long nominating campaign. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> primary, but with less than 50 percent of the vote in a multiple-candidate race and without broad backing from party leaders. On Friday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor noted that polls show him leading Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the all-but-certain Republican nominee, and said Democrats have the best chance to win the presidency in years. `` I've never seen our party so united,'' he said. `` I've never seen our party so together.'' Even so, the ever-cautious <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cautioned one audience to guard against overconfidence, noting that he once was defeated for re-election in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> after holding a 50-point lead in the polls. His comments about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> represented a continuation of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' attack against the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's handling of negotiations with the Panamanian leader. `` This is an administration that ca n't say no to drugs and drug peddlers, funneling aid to the Contras and convicted drug dealers that are doing time in federal penitentiaries, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> links with drug trafficking and drug profiteering in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. He said either President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or `` somebody in this administration'' should provide an explanation of alleged <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> ties to the Panamanian. `` It's been paying off <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> $ 200,000 a year. We've been paying that guy what we pay the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' He said the administration should explain publicly `` who was doing business with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and why we were doing business with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the $ 200,000 figure emerged from congressional hearings into <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s alleged links with the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>.

 Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on Friday blamed <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> for the breakdown in recent talks on the general's political <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who as head of the armed forces is the de facto leader of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, also said he held the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration responsible for his personal safety. He told a women's convention, `` I place responsibility for the life of <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> with the establishment of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. I hold the establishment responsible for the life of this son of God.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been trying to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to leave as head of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s 15,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> since he was indicted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in February as a major drug trafficker and money-launderer. On Wednesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials announced that their talks with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to resolve the struggle over <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s leadership had fallen apart. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> blamed the collapse on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The general did not elaborate on his charges Friday that <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, the assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, were responsible for the breakdown of the talks. But he called for `` foreign forces'' to leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to `` leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in peace. Sirs, for God's sake leave it in peace.'' Besides the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also has its <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, with overall responsibility for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military operations in a wide swath of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. About 10,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops with about 20,000 military dependents are in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, said Friday <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are `` practically nonexistent.'' <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said relations were bad `` because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains recognition of a government that does n't exist.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> recognizes <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s legal president, even though he was ousted in February after he tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as chief of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> then installed <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> as president, and <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> has been in hiding ever since. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> said Friday he warned the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in vain against go-it-alone tactics in talks with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. He also predicted violence if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> does n't leave. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> said other Latin American democracies offered to help and that they and the Panamanian opposition should have had a role. He met a small number of correspondents, including <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON>, at a location they agreed not to disclose and told them: `` I have always thought that -LRB- the talks -RRB- were a ploy to delay matters, to give -LRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> -RRB- time to strengthen his inner circle within the ... Defense Forces and at the end, yes, to ridicule President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think -LRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> -RRB- was sincere, and I told the -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB- administration that what happened would happen. That was n't very difficult. I told them about three weeks ago,'' he added. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> spoke at a news conference before leaving for <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to attend a conference of non-aligned nations. <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said he would use the <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> meeting to denounce what he called aggression by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. He also said the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> discussions with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were informal and did not involve the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. But he added, `` I want to reiterate to you that the reason those conversations did n't produce any result was the imposition by one of the sides. That's what finished off the conversations.'' He also said the government was evaluating damage to the Panamanian economy as a result of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions imposed in an effort to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power. He said it was looking into whether there is a basis for filing suit in the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. A ruling in such a suit, however, would be put into effect only if both parties agreed. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> wants the general to leave the country and <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> to return as president. In exchange, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would lift economic sanctions and possibly drop the drug charges. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> also blamed <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Thursday for the talks' collapsing `` The world must know that the conversation sustained with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s envoy broke down when he presented us with an ultimatum in which <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> had to accept immediately his last offer,'' he told a packed session of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Asked then whether his resignation had been discussed, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> replied: `` The commander does n't abandon his ship in stormy weather.''

What his priority is in any deal that may lead to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s removal from power is not clear Arrest warrants have been out for him for two months but the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> government is making no apparent serious attempt to find him. Asked if there were circumstances under which he might renounce his claim, <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> responded: `` Why should I? This is one of the basic factors, respect for the constitution by the military. `` All over Latin American there has been a clear, loud message that -LRB- the military -RRB- is below civilian government,'' he said. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> said Panamanians are not used to street violence but it could start if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> remains and the economy keeps going downhill. `` Economic pressures are building up and he knows it,'' <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` I think we will be facing violence in the near future,'' he said. `` The people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> are getting desperate. We will see some violent demonstrations here in the next few days or weeks.'' Violent street protests have occurred sporadically since last June, but have halted in what generally is attributed to the military's successful crackdown and the opposition's difficulty in mustering support.

<TEXT>
 Vietnamese officials and the the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> refugee agency began their annual meeting Friday, months earlier than usual following a sharp increase in the number of `` boat people'' fleeing <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION>. According to the agency, 10,628 boat people were registered in the region in the first four months of this year and the May figure is expected to top 4,000. Among topics to be discussed with a four-member <LOCATION> Vietnamese </LOCATION> delegation led by vice foreign minister <PERSON> Ha </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Lau </PERSON>, who also is ambassador to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, is the 9-year-old Orderly Departure Program, said <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumin </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the office of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees. The meeting normally occurs in autumn. Arrivals in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> increased from 798 in January through March to 1,381 in April and 1,596 in the first two weeks of May, Ms. <PERSON> Kumin </PERSON> told a weekly <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> news briefing. She said it was the highest level since 1979. Arrivals in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> also are above average, with 2,917 in the first quarter of 1988 and 1,904 in April, she said. The Orderly Departure Program was negotiated to give Vietnamese with relatives living abroad a safe, legal alternative to the risks of fleeing their country by land or by sea as boat people. It has enabled more than 136,000 Indochinese refugees to resettle in 24 countries since June 1979, Ms. <PERSON> Kumin </PERSON> said. Most refugees have gone to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, she said, and gave the numbers as 65,176 and 24,615 respectively. In 1984, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> called for expansion of the program by offering to admit all Amerasian children _ most of whose fathers were <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen _ and their close relatives, as well as political prisoners and their close family members. Ms. <PERSON> Kumin </PERSON> said the Amerasian question also was on the agenda of the annual meeting, scheduled to end Tuesday.

<HEAD>Report: Remains Found In Mass Grave Older Than World War II</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Experts analyzing remains found in a mass grave believe the bones may be almost two centuries old and not of World War II Nazi concentration camp victims, the news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The state-run agency said new evidence indicates the remains may have been buried in northwestern <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> under the reign of <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, who held power in the region in the late 18th century. <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> said the emperor had ordered that corpses be reburied outside municipal limits to prevent disease. The remains were found May 19 during work in a quarry near the town of Most, about 50 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. Archeologists had speculated that the remains could have either been those of death camp inmates killed by the Nazis or victims of Allied bombing attacks. `` The remains ... originally believed to come from the World War II period have been subject to ... -LRB- testing -RRB- which showed that they probably come from the period of the reign of <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>,'' <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> said. The news agency did not provide sources for the report and did not elaborate. But an official of the Most District Museum, which is in charge of the project, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the remains come from the time of <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> or the Napoleonic wars. `` I talked to people here who remember the end of World War II and no one recalled anything like this,'' said <PERSON> Libuse </PERSON> <PERSON> Pokorna </PERSON>. She said it was impossible to immediately estimate the number of the dead buried in the grave. <PERSON> Pokorna </PERSON> said final results from the tests could take a month.

 A woman who was arrested driving <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'s sports car and claiming she was his wife was arrested again after police found her inside the suburban home of the TV talk show host, authorities said Friday. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, 36, of no known address, was arrested Thursday night and arraigned Friday in <ORGANIZATION> Norwalk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on two counts of second-degree burglary and first-degree larcency, authorities said. She entered no plea and was ordered held on $ 25,000 bail pending a June 15 court appearance. Her second arrest came after a cab driver tipped police that he had just driven her from the local train station to <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'s house _ a day after <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> prosecutors dropped charges from her first arrest, Capt <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Angelastro </PERSON> said. `` It's very difficult at this time to explain her behavior based on what we know,'' <PERSON> Angelastro </PERSON> said. `` We do n't know where she is from. We are trying to determine that.'' Ms. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> first was arrested Sunday at the <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tunnel </LOCATION> as she drove the blue, 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Porsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carrera </ORGANIZATION> into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> with a 3-year-old passenger. She did n't have the $ 3 toll, authorities said. `` I'm Mrs. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> and this is <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> was reported by authorities to have told the toll collector. `` Do n't you think <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> is good for the toll? The child was put into the custody of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> juvenile authorities. Although <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> decided not to press charges after Sunday's incident, authorities will prosecute the woman on the latest charges regardless of the entertainer's wishes, <PERSON> Angelastro </PERSON> said `` She had no right being in the house and we took firm action against her when we found out she had entered the house last night,'' he said. After Sunday's arrest, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaan </LOCATION> police alerted by <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> officials found signs that someone, apparently Ms. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, had broken into <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'s modest, two-story house through a living room window, <PERSON> Angelastro </PERSON> said. Furniture, plants and a rug had been moved around and there were dirty dishes in the sink, he said. Ms. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> apparently entered the house through the same living room window again Thursday night, <PERSON> Angelastro </PERSON> said. She did n't repeat her claim that she was <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'s wife, he said <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>, the gap-toothed host of `` Late Night with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>,'' was reached by police in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where he has been staying. Although <PERSON> Angelastro </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> has made no threatening remarks about <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>, he believed <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> was concerned about the incidents. `` I'm sure this matter is of great concern to him,'' he said. After Sunday's arrest, <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> told authorities he did n't know the woman and that she did n't have permission to drive her car. Authorities said that after identifying herself Sunday as Mrs. <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> then called herself <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> and finally <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>. <PERSON> Angelastro </PERSON> said police found documents indicating her correct name is <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> pledged Friday to cool tensions in the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> region and continue a gradual improvement in relations between the once-hostile <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies. Foreign Ministers <PERSON> Carolos </PERSON> <PERSON> Papoulias </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Mesut </PERSON> <PERSON> Yilmaz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> told a joint news conference that four days of talks this week on political cooperation ended `` positively.'' `` The first steps we have made here are modest but encouraging. ... I believe that we are duty-bound to succeed in our future efforts as well,'' <PERSON> Yilmaz </PERSON> told reporters before leaving for <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. Both countries agreed to avoid staging military maneuvers in the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> during holidays and the summer tourist season. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> monitor each other's military exercises in the region and fighter pilots often stage mock dogfights over the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> has often protested alleged harrassment by Turkish fighters of Olympic Airways passenger jets flying tourists to the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> islands. The talks this week preceded a scheduled June 13-15 visit to <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> by Premier <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> and Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> agreed to avoid confrontation and boost bilateral relations during a January meeting in <LOCATION> Davos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> have longstanding disputes over control of <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> airspace, the military status of some Greek islands and the divided <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. In March 1987, they came to the brink of war over seabed oil drilling rights. But <PERSON> Papoulias </PERSON> said the ministers delayed discussion of `` large issues'' such as the presence of Turkish troops on <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>'s visit. The officials abolished abolished visa rules for diplomats in each other's capitals and agreed to continue talks on cooperation against narcotics, smuggling and terrorism.

<HEAD>Firefighter Fatalities Up; Heart Attack Still Number One Killer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>QUINCY, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The number of firefighters who died in the line of duty hit a seven-year high last year, with heart attacks again claiming the most lives, a national safety organization reported Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> reported 124 fatalities in 1987, a 9.7 percent increase over the previous year and the most since 1981, when 134 firefighters died. There were 72 volunteers and 52 career firefighters among the 1987 fatalities, according to the non-profit group that claims more than 44,000 members nationwide. Overall, heart attacks continued to be the number one killer, striking down 56 firefighters, the group said. Other major causes of fatalities included internal trauma, 28 deaths; asphyxiation, 13 deaths; and crushing, 12 deaths. Of the heart attack victims, 14 had prior heart problems; 10 had severe heart disease; two suffered from hypertension and one was fatigued prior to the attack. Heart attack has been the major cause of firefighter fatalities since the study began 11 years ago, the group said. While the number of fatal heart attacks among firefighters over 40 years old was down 16 percent from the previous year, the numbers were slightly higher among younger firefighters. There were five fatal heart attack victims under 35 years old, including two under 20. Fifty-three firefighters were killed while fighting fires, with 24 dying from heart attacks, 10 from internal trauma, eight from smoke inhalation, six from being crushed, two from burns, two from gunshot wounds and one from electrocution. Thirty-five firefighters were killed while responding to or returning from an alarm. For the first time since the association began issuing the report, the largest proportion of deaths in the line of duty occurred during wildland fires. Seventeen firefighters were killed battling such blazes, while five died responding to or returning from wildland fires. Fires of suspicious origins accounted for 23 deaths, according to the statistics.

 A 26-year-old woman was arrested Friday after the dismembered body of her boyfriend was found on the living room floor of her north <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> apartment, police said. <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> McLuckie </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> was jailed for investigation of first-degree murder.

 An entertainer whose 2-year-old daughter was mauled to death by a leopard used in his act said Friday that her death was an act of fate. `` We have no choice over life or death,'' <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` The cage that was involved in this was locked ... how and why this happened is nothing short of mystical.'' <PERSON> Nikka </PERSON>, daughter of <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> and his girlfriend, <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, died of head wounds, blood loss and shock after the attack Wednesday, doctors said. The leopard, Tabu, got out of its cage outside <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>'s farm house in suburban <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> and mauled the child. The cat was tranquilized after the attack and died a short time later while being taken for a 10-day quarantine to the <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think that he -LRB- God -RRB- protected her from growing up in this world, this society that is worse than any <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle,'' <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> Thursday from <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> where he was performing. He leads a touring rock ` n' roll act in which he sings and performs with pythons and leopards. Police said the attack was an accident and did n't anticipate any charges. <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>'s older daughter, <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Saccio </PERSON>, 24, said in a telephone interview from her home in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, that she has taken care of her father's five leopards occasionally but feared only Tabu. Ms. <PERSON> Saccio </PERSON>, who said her father legally changed his name for show business reasons about 15 years ago, said she took care of the leopards most recently in January and February. `` The black ones -LRB- leopards -RRB- were pretty tame. It was just Tabu _ my dad raised <PERSON> Tabu </PERSON> with a Rottweiler, and after that dog was killed in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, that cat went nuts,'' Ms. <PERSON> Saccio </PERSON> said. `` My dad was the only one who could get around it.'' Ms. <PERSON> Saccio </PERSON> said she lives with her mother, <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> Saccio </PERSON>, and that she has a brother, <PERSON> Joey </PERSON>, also in his 20s. Police Chief <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said authorities think Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Nikka </LOCATION> outside for a moment while she went into the house, `` and when she came out, the cat was on the kid.'' Four other cats also escaped from the cage but police and wildlife officials herded them back in. Ms. <PERSON> Saccio </PERSON> said she did n't know how the cats could have gotten loose. `` The fences were tightly secured. That's why I thought maybe she -LRB- Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> -RRB- had cleaned the cage or fed them, then left it unlocked,'' Ms. <PERSON> Saccio </PERSON> said. `` These animals are very smart. Leopards can turn a knob.''

 A rebel military leader turned himself in to the leftist government and said Friday he will try to bring the 400 Contras formerly under his command out of the mountains. <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, alias Commander <LOCATION> Alfa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, 26, told reporters Friday he had decided to quit the U.S.-supported insurgency on Wednesday and take advantage of the Sandinista government's amnesty program. <ORGANIZATION> Alfa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lima </ORGANIZATION>, a former evangelical preacher before he took up arms against the government, spoke to reporters accompanied by Sandinista officials. His acceptance of the amnesty coincided with the third round of high-level peace talks in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> between the government and a <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> delegation that included his former commander-in-chief, <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>. `` We regret it,'' <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> said upon learning of <ORGANIZATION> Alfa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lima </ORGANIZATION>'s decision `` He was a field commander with a long record. We consider him a war casualty.'' The Nicaraguan government considered <ORGANIZATION> Alfa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lima </ORGANIZATION> one of the most effective Contra field commanders. He had led a special military task force in central Chontales province since 1984. In an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Alfa </PERSON> <PERSON> Lima </PERSON> said his decision followed a series of talks with his troops and with <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers during the provisional truce that went into effect April 1. `` We sat in this farm in Chontales and we talked about how we Nicaraguans were killing each other,'' <ORGANIZATION> Alfa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lima </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We talked about how we wanted peace.'' The Contras took up arms against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> in November 1981. On Wednesday, he and six of his men abandoned their camp in Chontales. `` We had many problems,'' he said. `` I had more than 400 men under my command. Since February we had trouble getting supplies. We would ask the command in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> for supplies and then the planes supposedly would come from the Honduran bases. But the commanders refused to supply us. They were hoarding everything since the truce started.'' <ORGANIZATION> Alfa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lima </ORGANIZATION> said he hoped to encourage more of his former Contra troops to take advantage of the amnesty. `` I am going to try to convince my men to come in. There are many out there who do not know what they are doing or why they are fighting,'' said the soft-spoken <LOCATION> Alfa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, still wearing his camouflage uniform. `` Many of them are people separated from society. They say they fight for democracy, for freedom, because they were told that, but they do n't really know,'' he said. `` I am going to show them that there are guarantees,'' he added. Under the program the government enacted in 1985, rebels may lay down their arms and return to normal life in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> without fear of reprisal. <ORGANIZATION> Alfa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lima </ORGANIZATION> said he joined the Contras in 1982 after he was threatened and harassed by a <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officer while he served as an evangelical pastor in his native <LOCATION> Jinotega </LOCATION> province.

 After a week in which <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> teachers were bludgeoned, slashed, pummeled and blasted, their union leader called Friday for increased security and tougher sentences for teacher assaults. `` One attack against a teacher is outrageous and to have four in one week is just intolerable,'' said <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>. `` And we're afraid that this is just the tip of the iceberg.'' Though schools officials insisted the number of attacks on teachers had actually decreased in three years, Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said the city was concerned about teacher safety and he called a `` summit meeting'' Tuesday of the chancellor, union leaders, the five district attorneys and police commissioner to discuss the problem. The latest act of violence occurred Thursday afternoon when a physical education teacher came upon an intruder rifling through students' gym bags outside a <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> school and was beaten unconscious with a baseball bat. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 37, who remained unconscious Friday, was the fourth teacher assaulted. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> was knifed Monday more than a dozen times by a mugger in the bathroom of a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> grammar school. The other incidents included a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> teacher who was beaten up by a student, the student's brother and sister Tuesday, and a 71-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> teacher injured Wednesday by an M-80 firecracker tossed into her classroom. All the victims except <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> were in good condition Friday, officials said. `` There's something seriously wrong here,'' said <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Marco </PERSON>, who added that the attack on <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> made him even more `` angry and frustrated.'' The need for increased security has long been evident to <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> who said he teaches in `` a neighborhood that's known for two things: heroin and crack.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Marco </PERSON>, speaking from his hospital bed, said his attacker was `` some young crazed guy, looking to make a quick score.'' The assailant got a few subway tokens and a couple of dollars; <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> got kicked in the ribs, abdomen and groin and stabbed in the ear, neck, shoulder, side and back. `` A few more inches and it could have been my eye or an artery and we would n't be having this conversation,'' said <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Marco </PERSON>, who is expected to recover. Yet the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> said the number of assaults in city schools have decreased, mainly because of an increase in security guards in elementary schools. There were 1,322 assaults in the city's 1,000 schools in 1985-86 and 969 this year, said board spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Terte </PERSON>. That included 337 teachers assaulted in 1985-86 and 198 so far this year, he said. The rest were on students or other personnel including custodians and cafeteria workers. An assault could be anything beginning with a shove against a wall, <PERSON> Terte </PERSON> said. In addition, <PERSON> Terte </PERSON> said 350 security guards have been added in the last two years, and the operating budget for school safety increased from $ 31.8 million to nearly $ 43.2 million. There are currently 2,081 guards in schools. But the <ORGANIZATION> UFT </ORGANIZATION> insists there were about 1,000 physical attacks against teachers both last year and this year. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Muir </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> UFT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said about 20 percent required emergency-room treatment. Though Ms. <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> acknowledged a decrease in teacher assaults and a rise in security personnel, she said `` it's obviously not good enough.'' `` If we have four incidents in one week and if we have a situation where a teacher can be bludgeoned this way in a school yard while he's teaching kids, then obviously the efforts, and I do acknowledge the effort, is n't enough.'' She praised new schools Chancellor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> for his proposal to put metal detectors in five violence-prone schools this fall and said she felt he was anxious to stem violence. But she said the changes ca n't come quick enough. The <ORGANIZATION> UFT </ORGANIZATION> wants guards in every school and police officers in troubled neighborhoods. The union also is pushing for legislation to make any physical attack on a teacher a felony offense, no matter how minor. A bill is pending in the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said that too often if the defendant is a minor `` nothing is done.'' `` It's already difficult to get teachers into the school system'' without adding problems like these, Ms. <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said. She said about half the system's 63,000 teachers are eligible to retire and these incidents are likely to prompt some to say, `` Look, I've had it. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Marco </PERSON>, however, is not one of them. `` I look around this room and see all the letters and pictures the kids sent me and there is no way I ca n't go back,'' he said.

 A man hailed as a hero for saving a family from their burning building has acknowledged lying when he told people afterward that he was a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran and that he had only a minor criminal record. Some of the people helping him say it does n't matter. Offers of aid have poured in for <PERSON> Rikka </PERSON> <PERSON> Pash </PERSON>, 42, since news accounts of his saving a mother and her six young children from their burning apartment building a week ago, according to a social worker and his employer. <PERSON> Pash </PERSON> lied when he told reporters after the fire that he was a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran and that he had served only one year in prison for cashing a Social Security check illegally, according to a published report. In truth, <PERSON> Pash </PERSON> admitted he never joined the Army as he said, and admitted he had served several years in prison on violations ranging from auto theft to parole violations, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday. <PERSON> Pash </PERSON> could not be reached for comment. His employer said he was still recuperating from a gash suffered in the fire and he was not at a hotel that offered him lodging Friday afternoon, the manager said. <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, a social worker who has been helping <PERSON> Pash </PERSON> through the <ORGANIZATION> Safer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit group that assists ex-offenders, said money sent to her by a veterans group would be returned. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Podeszwa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pash </PERSON>'s boss at <ORGANIZATION> Deluxe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Golf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Repair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION>, said he would also return checks to their senders, but the situation would not endanger <PERSON> Pash </PERSON>'s employment there. Both said they would continue to help <PERSON> Pash </PERSON>. The fire consumed all of <PERSON> Pash </PERSON>'s belongings and about $ 150 he had saved, <PERSON> Pash </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said earlier this week. Hotel Lincoln on the city's <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> has offered him a place to stay for a week or two, and the new revelations will not prompt withdrawal of the offer, said Manager <PERSON> Dede </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. `` The owner of the hotel was already aware of this,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. `` He was just trying to help someone who's trying to change his life.'' <PERSON> Pash </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> Thursday he does not want money and that people who want contributions returned to them at the hotel or the foundation. `` I have a place to live,'' he said. `` I'm trying to leave my past behind me, and to go forward in life. I want to thank people for all their willingness to help me.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trusteeship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Friday brushed off Soviet warnings of impending <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> militarization of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> territory of Palau and approved progress toward <PERSON> Palau </PERSON>'s adopting a Compact of Free Association with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> voted in favor of a report urging approval of the compact and recommending that any disputes in interpretion be resolved between <LOCATION> Palau </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> voted against the report. Soviet delegate <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bykov </PERSON> also said the report failed to mention racism in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. The British delegate, <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, had accused the Soviets on Thursday of `` trying to make twisted allegations of racism where none existed.'' <PERSON> Bykov </PERSON> said Thursday that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s true intention was to `` dominate the people of the Trust Territory in order to maintain <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> strategic dominance in the area.'' He accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of `` planning to continue to strengthen and broaden test areas for missile technology and other military bases'' in the region. On Friday, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryne </PERSON> retorted that `` contrary to the assertions of a few, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not turned the <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Territory </ORGANIZATION> into a military base ... and has no intention of doing so. Those who condemn the ` militarization' of <LOCATION> Micronesia </LOCATION> seek to mislead the world in order to advance their own agenda in the region.'' The Soviets have sought in recent years to negotiate fishing rights with several <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> island nations. Since World War II, the region had been mainly regarded as an American preserve free of Soviet influence. In March, Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, chairman of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> joint chiefs of staff, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committtee </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Palau </PERSON> would be `` one of the first ... areas that we would have to look at'' if <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> could no longer keep military bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, where treaty rights are under renegotiation. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has administered <ORGANIZATION> Palau </ORGANIZATION> under a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> trusteeship since World War II, when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces drove Japanese occupiers from the region. The Compact of Free Association for <PERSON> Palau </PERSON> would grant the group of islands self-government in economic, social and educational affairs. The <LOCATION> Palau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, with a population of about 12,000, are located about 500 miles east of the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION>. In April, a court in Palau invalidated a 1987 referendum in which 73 percent of the voters approved the compact, ruling that a 75 percent majority was required to adopt it. <PERSON> Palau </PERSON>'s government is expect to appeal the ruling. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> says the <ORGANIZATION> U.N </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> can dissolve the trusteeship.

 Beef and pork have disappeared from meat counters throughout communist <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> as a new wave of shortages hit the country, a federal market inspectors' report to the government said Friday. Coffee was reported in sparse supply in some parts and cleaning powder can only be bought on and off, the <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Politika </ORGANIZATION> quoted as saying in their report. Other staples in short supply included butter, car tires, cement and some construction materials. Most Yugoslavs have been reported on a mass shopping spree in recent weeks in anticipation of steep price rises expected when a government price freeze ends next month. The new austerity program, aimed at curbing <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s highest inflation and repaying a $ 20 billion foreign debt, provides for further wage cuts and widespread price increases. The measures were originally due to start May 15 but were put off until June because new loans from Western creditors failed to materialize. The economic package is intended to reduce wages of Yugoslavs by up to 30 percent at a time when 80 percent of manufacturers announced new, higher prices for their products after the price freeze expires. Slovenian furniture manufacturers have already announced price increases of up to 80 percent and those of electric ware and paper products of up to 100 percent after the 6 -LCB- - month freeze is lifted To cope with the meat shortage, the government announced it was making available 20,000 tons of meat from emergency reserves. <PERSON> Bozidar </PERSON> <PERSON> Komadinic </PERSON>, director general of Centroproizvod company, said there was little hope that coffee will be available in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> any time soon, <ORGANIZATION> Politika </ORGANIZATION> reported.

 A spectacular fire destroyed restaurants and shops on the popular <LOCATION> Redondo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pier </LOCATION> on Friday, chasing away thousands of people and destroying much of the structure. Three firefighters suffered minor injuries battling the blaze, said fire Battalion Chief Pat Aust. Damage was estimated at more than $ 1 million. Aust termed the fire `` completely accidental,'' based on a eyewitness accounts, but he would not elaborate. The fire, reported about 1:40 p.m., sent plumes of smoke and flame billowing into the sky over this resort city 25 miles south of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The smoke was visible for 10 miles. Aust said flammable creosote used as a preservative on the pilings produced a noxious gas, adding to the problems of firefighters who could not get to the flames spreading beneath the pier. Firefighters from six cities fought the blaze for more than 3 -LCB- hours from the shore and in small boats, and poured water onto smouldering pilings even after the fire was declared out around 4:30 p.m. The fire apparently started in The Breakers restaurant, which was closed at the time, and spread to several other buildings on the pier, officials said. About 40 patrons were evacuated without incident from The Edge restaurant nearby. Three shops were destroyed along with the two restaurants, authorities said. Severe storms last winter caused between $ 30 million and $ 40 million damage on and around the pier, and on Jan. 31, opne person was killed and nine others were injured when a steel grate atop a parking structure collapsed.

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is moving with unusual speed toward final approval of a $ 1.1 trillion federal budget for the 1989 fiscal year, thanks to a little bipartisan cooperation and a lot of creative arithmetic.

The budget meets the spending ceilings for domestic, defense and international affairs programs set at last fall's budget summit by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and congressional leaders. It also obeys the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law's $ 146 billion deficit target for fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1.

 By shuffling the summit schedule and questioning delegations set to meet with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is sending an unmistakeable signal that he intends to seize the initiative during the pair's <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> face-off. The challenge facing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as he awaits the start of the summit Sunday is to maintain his well-rehearsed game plan _ or to alter it to compete with the Soviet leader. The Soviets already have scrambled the schedule for the talks opening Monday and apparently imposed restraints on some of the people who hoped to meet with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in his first visit to the Soviet capital, will see an enormous city of 12-lane boulevards dominated in part by seven massive Stalin-era Baroque buildings. He will see the city at its best: the lilacs are blooming, the weather is mild and downtown stores are stocked with meat and tomatoes. Arriving for the first time in the Soviet capital is at times like taking a trip back in time. The electrical appliances seem old-fashioned and traffic jams are rare, though smog has taken hold. Nearly 9 million people live here, yet the only time it seems crowded is when people are queuing to buy food, perfume, and other scarce consumer goods. Humans are dwarfed by immense buildings, both the charmless, modern structures from the 1960s _ said to be modeled on buildings <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> saw and liked in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> _ and a variety of monuments to mother <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>'s war heroes.

 When the `` Albion Tornado'' roared toward <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> three years ago, <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> ran to warn his wife, <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON>, on their front porch `` when I saw the wind pick her up and throw her over the rail.'' Across the street, the Rev. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> prayed hard as the gathering winds sucked him toward a second-floor window and his strength ebbed. Next door, 5-year-old <PERSON> Katie </PERSON> <PERSON> Steff </PERSON> screamed `` Tornado coming!'' as her father, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON>, huddled the family above their funeral home. In a moment of eerie silence a few seconds later, <PERSON> Steff </PERSON> knew they were in the eye of the huge twister. Forty-one tornadoes, including nine of the highest intensities, swept through <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> during eight hours of May 31, 1985, killing 88 people and injuring more than 1,000. The tornado outbreak, worst since April 1975, caused $ 450 million in property damage in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Of the dead, 62 were killed in their houses or mobile homes and a disproportionate number, 15, were between 66 and 70 years old, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The Albion tornado was among the worst, packing winds estimated at up to 260 miles per hour as it fell upon farmland on the <LOCATION> Ohio-Pennsylvania </LOCATION> border. The twister, estimated at 1,200 feet across, quickly moved northeast through this pleasant crossroads town near <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> on a 14-mile tear that killed 12 people. `` I watch the sky now, just like everyone else,'' Mayor <PERSON> Bonda </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahlin </PERSON> said recently. `` Tornadoes were <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> kind of things. But I do n't think it's something we'll ever forget.'' `` People here still cringe the minute there's a dark cloud in the sky. There's such anticipation,'' said Borough Secretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, 72, a retired railroad worker, heard the first frantic warnings on the police scanner and ran to the door to see his wife get swept away. He woke up trapped in his own house. `` I started hollering,'' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> recalled. `` There were timbers all over me. The beams were across my legs and I could n't move. They tried to jack up the beams, but that just put more pressure on my legs. Then they got a chain saw and cut the beams in half and pulled me out.'' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> suffered only cuts and bruises. His wife suffered broken arms and a dislocated shoulder. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, 68, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, was in his rectory's living room `` when the roof went off and the windows went out.'' `` I kind of spread-eagled in front of the window as the thing began to suck me out. I grabbed anything. I just hung on until it ended,'' <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said. `` I asked God to make it that I was ready to meet Him.'' The church and rectory were destroyed, but two days later <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said Mass under a tarpaulin in the ruins. <PERSON> Steff </PERSON>, 43, a mortician, gathered his wife, four daughters and a friend in the family room of their second-floor apartment. <PERSON> Katie </PERSON> screamed just as <ORGANIZATION> Albion </ORGANIZATION>'s fire siren began to wail. `` Then something hit the house and we all got into the bathroom. Things just bombarded the building,'' <PERSON> Steff </PERSON> recalled. `` Then we heard a silence, just for a second, like in the eye of a hurricane. Then everything hit us from the other side. <PERSON> Patty </PERSON>, my wife, opened the door of the family room and it was gone.'' The Steffs' business and home were destroyed, a $ 200,000 loss. <PERSON> Steff </PERSON> ran across the street to help free <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> from her three-story Victorian house, which was down. `` I called into the debris to tell her help was coming,'' <PERSON> Steff </PERSON> said. `` Later, she told me she was never so glad to hear an undertaker's voice.'' A deputy Erie County coroner, <PERSON> Steff </PERSON> helped set up a morgue at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. They brought in 11 bodies. Today, the tornado's southwest-to-northeast path can be clearly seen in rebuilt split-level houses and new mobile homes, grassy lots and sharply pruned oak trees that make the east side of <LOCATION> Albion </LOCATION> look like a new subdivision. It was only a few months ago, <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> said, that he `` closed the books'' on <ORGANIZATION> Albion </ORGANIZATION>'s claims with federal and state disaster officials. Mayor <PERSON> Dahlin </PERSON> estimated that fewer than 200 of the town's 1,800 people moved away after the tornado `` because of memories, lack of money or whatever.'' `` People are getting on with their lives,'' she said. `` Businesses are being rebuilt, changing hands, and there are new ones.'' <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>'s modern new 400-seat church is linked by a glass breezeway to a new three-bedroom rectory. Behind, a new recreation building stands in red brick. The complex cost $ 1.1 million, he said. `` One of the greatest experiences of my life, as tragic as it was, was to see the spirit of the people of this town. They took a tragic blow. They rebuilt the town,'' <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said. `` It's almost profane to say it was a good thing, but the bottom line is that the community is stronger and closer knit and the town is even physically better with all the new construction,'' he said. The Steffs, fully insured, rebuilt their small funeral home with two viewing rooms, but took the opportunity to move their living quarters to a house in another part of town. `` We shed our tears over it. We're trying to get our lives together. You can dwell on the negatives, but the positives are the concern and the love of the community,'' <PERSON> Steff </PERSON> said. `` When I walked out the door that day, I knew I was going to stay.'' The Rices built a modern two-bedroom split-level house. `` It's starting to feel like home,'' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said with a shrug `` You still think about it. Last September, I had an operation for cancer and when I was in the recovery room, I thought I was still under the house,'' he said. `` I do n't want to see another one.''

<TEXT>
 Long after colonialism yielded to independence for many African nations, their art is still in the grip of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Masks, sculptures, ritual objects, jewelry _ once mere utensils for <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> tribes _ have become coveted art pieces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. And a show at the Palais des Beaux-Arts here shows interest is still gaining. African art is so abundant in such former colonial powers as <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, that the show relied on 50 private collections for material. Organizers say there was no need to tap other sources, such as museums, religious orders and companies with a colonial past to stage the exhibit that has been widely acclaimed. `` In colonial times, the pieces were brought here and stacked away and little happened afterwards,'' said <PERSON> Elze </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruyninx </PERSON>, an organizer of the <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> show. `` Now there is increasing interest for their aesthetic qualities.'' As the exhibit demonstrates, private collectors have had a sharp eye for quality. `` What we found in private collections was world class quality,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Herreman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Antwerp </LOCATION>'s ethnographical museum, who helped stage the exhibit. The show displays 330 pieces, many from central <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, featuring the severe expressionist lines that mark African art. It includes terracotta pieces, over 2,000 years old, from <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> and centuries-old wooden and metal statues and masks from <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. Many are from the former Belgian colony <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, others are from as far away as <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. They are on view until mid-June and already over 20,000 people have visited the show since it opened in late March. The richness of European collections has long been a source of misgiving in African nations. Some, spurred by President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sese </PERSON> <PERSON> Seko </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, have in recent decades joined such nations as <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, which has staged diplomatic protests to focus on the loss of some of its finest art to invading European powers. <PERSON> Imbata </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosumbe </PERSON>, cultural director of the <ORGANIZATION> Zairian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, laments that legislation has never been enacted to ensure the return of art works. `` We wish it would return. We only have moral arguments though, and to rely on morals is a pious wish,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> that the colonial powers had taken everything and that they now had to give it back,'' said <PERSON> Huguette </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Geluwe </PERSON>, head of the ethnography department of the Museum of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. One of the world's biggest treasure troves of African art, it boasts an extensive collection of Zairian art. Since the waning days of colonialism in the 1960s, some art works have returned home from former colonial powers, but it has been more a trickle than the flow that African nations wanted. `` African leaders and the intellectuals are now very conscious of its value and appreciate the pieces as art,'' said <PERSON> Bruyninx </PERSON>. However, this was not always so. What is now called African art often had its origins as simple utensils. African masks and sculptures had medical or protective functions. The notion of `` art for art's sake'' was a novel concept of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s colonizers. `` From the moment an object lost its function it became worthless,'' <PERSON> Bruyninx </PERSON> said. Often, they rotted in the tropical conditions or were even ritually destroyed. `` As a pure art object, it was seldom of value,'' she said. <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> soon changed that. After the utensils and other objects came to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as exotic curiosities, some European artists, including <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>, created an active interest by blending it into their own works. <PERSON> Bruyninx </PERSON> said the objects were well cared for in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> where African art became a phenomenon in its own right. `` Many Africans are pleased when they see what has happened with their art here,'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Geluwe </PERSON> said. `` They see it as a showcase for their country.'' The Utotombo exhibit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, for example, has been endorsed by <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>'s ambassador here, despite <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>'s hope of recovering its art from <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. `` Contradictions are the spice of life,'' <PERSON> Mosumbe </PERSON> said. Although much African art is now in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, many works is still in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Herreman </PERSON>. `` What makes it tough for many African nations is that their museums are not suitably'' managed to handle it, he said. For one thing, there is the lure of money. With some pieces fetching hundreds of thousands of dollars at auctions in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, some art works simply disappear from African museums, experts say. And even when an African museum has a first-right option on national art works, it often can not afford them. End Adv PM Tues May 31

<HEAD>Economists Don't Like It, But Equilibrium Is More Exception Than

<TEXT>
 Economists are uncovering peculiar similarities in events that range from the death of the steam-powered automobile in the early 1900s to the crash of the stock market last October. The decline of <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>'s Betamax, they find, has something in common with the birth of the auto industry in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. There are even similarities between the width of railroad tracks and the strange QWERTY arrangement of keys on a typewriter. In different ways, these rises and falls all defy economic doctrines of stability. All are examples of `` positive feedback'' _ things that get going in one direction and then keep going the same way. Like an avalanche, or a whistling microphone, or a buffalo stampede. Positive feedback helps explain what happened last Oct. 19, when corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> lost nearly a quarter of its paper value in a single day. When prices dropped that day, buyers should have come in to pick up bargains. But trading strategies such as portfolio insurance locked the market into a suicidal loop of positive feedback, so each price decline triggered fresh sales. Portfolio insurers said they could protect investors against losses by selling their stocks and putting the money into interest-bearing <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills. It worked _ until everybody else tried to sell at the same time. The loop was finally broken on Oct. 20, when the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial system was nearing gridlock. If all stocks had been covered by portfolio insurance, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average theoretically could have sunk to zero. That is the power of positive feedback. In less frightening ways, positive feedback explains other things that defy traditional concepts of equilibrium. Once the VHS format got a slight edge over <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>'s Betamax, for example, video rental shops began stocking more VHS tapes. That encouraged more people to buy VHS recorders, and so on. Now even <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has added a VHS recorder line. Snowball effects likewise account for how railroad tracks that are 4 feet, 8 -LCB- inches wide crowded out other gauges, or why autos and electronics came to be concentrated in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> instead of evenly spread across the country. Herds of buffalo eventually get tired of stampeding. And at some point salaries for electronics engineers may get so high in <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> that it makes sense to locate elsewhere. Tired buffalo and overcrowding in <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> are examples of negative feedback, which leads to the cherished equilibrium of standard economics. In some cases, though, negative feedback never kicks in. Society becomes `` locked in,'' to use the phrase of <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>, a professor of population studies and economics at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who has done pioneering research in the field. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON>, a colleague of <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Stanford </LOCATION>, has traced how the QWERTY typewriter layout has persisted in spite of the obvious superiority of the <ORGANIZATION> Dvorak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Simplified </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Keyboard </ORGANIZATION>, which is 20 to 40 percent faster and can be learned in a few days. Then there is the clean, efficient steam-powered automobile, which exists no more. Years ago, smelly gasoline-powered cars gained some tiny advantage that grew into total dominance because the country was not big enough for two kinds of cars. In 1904, a man named <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> with a cloudy crystal ball wrote: `` Unless the objectionable features of the petrol carriage can be removed, it is bound to be driven from the road, to give place to its less objectionable rival, the steam-driven vehicle of the day.'' <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> knew the power of positive feedback. He just bet on the wrong horseless carriage. In 1988, it's clear that many people do n't know the power of positive feedback. For example, whiz kids in finance failed to foresee the damage that portfolio insurance could wreak in a falling stock market. Knowing about the snowball effect does n't guarantee being able to do anything about it, but who knows? One thing could lead to another.

<TEXT>
 The name for this village in <LOCATION> Hebrew </LOCATION> and Arabic means `` Oasis of Peace,'' and it is taken seriously by the Arabs and Jews who have been living here together for the past 10 years in the <LOCATION> Judean </LOCATION> foothills. The recent Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> has created strains for them but it has also brought new levels of cooperation and understanding to the community's 14 families _ nine Jewish, five <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION>. `` It's paradoxical,'' said <PERSON> Abed </PERSON> <PERSON> Najah </PERSON>, an Arab who is the village secretary. `` The uprising has made us stronger. We are more certain than ever that what we are doing is the best and most important thing to do.'' Those who came to live in the village that once was a no man's land 15 miles west of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> chose to span the national and religious divide that splits Israeli Jews and Arabs into hostile and suspicious groups Here they share authority, educate their children in <LOCATION> Hebrew </LOCATION> and Arabic, and try to spread a message of tolerance to visiting Israeli high school children through special seminars in their `` School of Peace.'' Living together for a decade has never been simple, however. Arab residents had to fight for official recognition for the Arabic name for the village, <PERSON> Wahati </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Salaam </PERSON>. Also, under a compromise agreement, Jews observe the Israeli Independence Day holiday while Arabs do not. But the 70 residents are determined to find an alternative to the current realities of Arab-Jewish relations. Outside <PERSON> Neve </PERSON> <PERSON> Shalom </PERSON>, tensions between Arabs and Jews have been seriously exacerbated over the past five months by the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising. <PERSON> Neve </PERSON> <PERSON> Shalom </PERSON> has been largely protected from the tensions, according to <PERSON> Ariella </PERSON> <PERSON> Beeri </PERSON>, 29, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> spokeswoman for the School of Peace and a longtime resident of the village. `` The uprising was not new for anyone who already developed social and political awareness,'' she said. `` We have always been aware of the reality of the occupation.'' Jews and Arabs in <PERSON> Neve </PERSON> <PERSON> Shalom </PERSON> regard the Arab revolt as a sign that the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> have taken responsibility for their own fate. `` I am very proud of the uprising,'' said <PERSON> Najah </PERSON>, the village secretary. `` Today the Palestinians are writing the brightest page of their history.'' Until now, <PERSON> Neve </PERSON> <PERSON> Shalom </PERSON>, or <PERSON> Wahati </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Salaam </PERSON>, avoided politics so as not to drive away Jewish high school children from the School of Peace seminars. But the Palestinian uprising has changed that. Recently all 70 <PERSON> Neve </PERSON> <PERSON> Shalom </PERSON> residents demonstrated in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> against what they view as excessively harsh measures used by the Isreali army to supress <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> demonstrators. <PERSON> Neve </PERSON> <PERSON> Shalom </PERSON> also has set up exchange visits with the nearby <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Bet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sira </LOCATION> and has sent its residents food supplies. `` We visited just after the soldiers were there,'' said <PERSON> Najah </PERSON>. `` We saw the fear in their eyes, and how the women and children stank of tear gas.'' `` We always thought of <PERSON> Neve </PERSON> <PERSON> Shalom </PERSON> as an educational project,'' he added. `` But we've seen lately that things are happening that force us to take action.'' The residents of <PERSON> Neve </PERSON> <PERSON> Shalom </PERSON> are reluctant to discuss tensions caused in their community by the Palestinian uprising. But one especially sensitive point is military reserve duty, required of Jewish residents of <PERSON> Neve </PERSON> <PERSON> Shalom </PERSON> but not the Arabs. So far, none of the four residents called up have been sent to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. `` The village does n't tell them what to do,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Beeri </PERSON>. `` But there's a lot of social pressure for them not to serve in the occupied territories. If they go, it will be hard for them to face the others.'' Ms. <PERSON> Beeri </PERSON> says the uprising has altered relations between the Jewish and Arabs students who come for the peace seminars, however. `` The uprising is strengthening the Arabs. It is giving them the feeling that someone is looking out for their interests. The Jews are frightened by the power of the uprising, by how close it is to them geographically.'' The seminar talks also have taken on a new urgency. The Jewish high school students see the issues as personal and crucial. They are only a year away from being drafted into the army and that is likely to lead to direct and violent confrontation with Palestinians. <PERSON> Beeri </PERSON> said one Jewish student put it succinctly when he said goodbye to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> students at the end of a seminar. `` See you again at the stone-throwing,'' he said.

<HEAD>Time Comes for Mules and Men to Guard India's Border</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 As the snow melts in the <LOCATION> Himalayas </LOCATION>, winter's natural barrier comes down and it becomes the task of men, mules and machines of the Indian army to take up a long summer vigil on the disputed frontier with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Last summer the world's two most populous nations massed 300,000 troops along the border after trading charges of border violations. `` This summer we are leaving nothing to chance after last year's experience,'' said an army officer in the garrison town of <LOCATION> Shillong </LOCATION> in northeastern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> Starting in May, the `` dormant'' status of the 105,000 Indian soldiers stationed on the frontier in <LOCATION> Arunachal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> state was upgraded to `` live,'' the officer said. This means the troops can be called for combat on short notice. `` It does not mean we are preparing for a war or itching for it, but this is the price we have to pay to keep the Chinese dragon away,'' said the officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> fought a border war in 1962 and their relations have remained strained. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> claims 34,750 square miles of Indian land that covers the entire state of <LOCATION> Arunachal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> not only rejects the Chinese claim to the state but says <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> captured 14,000 square miles of northwestern <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> state during the 1962 war. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has offered to give up its claim to <LOCATION> Arunachal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> if <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> recognizes <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s sovereignty over areas of <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION>. But in eight rounds of talks that began in December 1981, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has refused the Chinese offer, claiming both areas belong to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. An Indian reporter for The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> recently toured the northeastern states, which are off-limits to foreigners, to see the Indian army's preparedness. Long military convoys moved regularly from the central command base of <LOCATION> Tezpur </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Assam </LOCATION> state to border areas in neighboring <LOCATION> Arunachal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION>. Trucks towed tarpaulin-covered field guns. Hundreds of mules hauled rations and artillery through terrain so rugged that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has not been able to build roads. In the last two months <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has sent two divisions, 30,000 soldiers in all, to <LOCATION> Arunachal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> to reinforce 75,000 troops already stationed on the frontier. An additional 60,000 soldiers are garrisoned within about 300 miles of the frontier. The Indian air force has up to 160 interceptors, 55 to 60 deep-penetration aircraft and 35 to 40 bombers in the region. `` Our military presence in the eastern sector is enough to counter any <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> military adventures,'' a senior <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> said. A Chinese diplomat in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> said the Indians were exaggerating the so-called <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> threat. `` We have neither the intention nor the need to push Indian troops back. We are happy where we are,'' the diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity. But Brig. R.S. <PERSON> Virk </PERSON>, who retired from the Indian army last year, said in an interview in <LOCATION> Assam </LOCATION>: `` The whole exercise is more of a shadow boxing than real military necessity. `` There is nothing to gain in the Godforsaken land. Not even a blade of grass grows there.'' The border dispute between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> stems from a line drawn on a map in 1914 by Sir <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON>, foreign secretary of British colonial <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> accepts the line _ or its interpretation of it. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> does not. The <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON> line was drawn with a thick red pencil. On the map, the line covers, in breadth, four to five miles in actual territory. Border tension in the area started in May 1986 with reports that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had moved in troops and built a helipad in the <LOCATION> Sumdrong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. The valley lies one to two miles south of the <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON> line, according to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, and north of it, according to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. In April 1987, Indian troops advanced close to Chinese soldiers. The Indians said they spotted intruding Chinese patrols in four areas claimed by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> rejected the Indian report and accused <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> of setting up seven lookout posts north of the line. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has a population of 1.02 billion and 2.9 million men under arms. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> with 800 million people has 1.2 million military personnel. But <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has air superiority in its Soviet and French aircraft. The summer vigil, however, costs <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> an additional $ 100,000 a day in high-altitude pay for soldiers, extra rations and air surveillance. That puts more economic strain on a nation that has 37 percent of its people living below the poverty line. End Adv Tues PMs June 7

<HEAD>The `Misfortune 500' Peeks Under the Executive Carpet</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Peel back the carpet in the executive suite, and you'll need a shovel to dig through what's been swept underneath. At least that's the tone of the rollicking `` Misfortune 500,'' a 210-page catalog of Corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s `` worst bosses, dumbest strategies and most disastrous products.'' Authors <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> and <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Zullo </PERSON>'s guiding premise is that business blunders do n't get the attention they deserve thanks to `` uptight execs'' who are basically humorless _ except when it comes to the faux pas of their competitors. `` We have a great respect for big business because it is the backbone of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, but they have to learn to lighten up a little bit,'' <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> said. From the <ORGANIZATION> Adams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beverage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Zale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, these two irreverent business bashers dug for the dirt and found it. Among the biggest blunders, they roast the Mars candy company for passing up the chance to have M & amp; Ms featured in the 1982 box-office blockbuster `` E.T.'' The movie's lovable alien devoured <PERSON> Reese </PERSON>'s Pieces instead, boosting sales for rival chocolate maker <ORGANIZATION> Hershey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. And speaking of chocolate, from the products-that-didn ` t-get-off-the-ground -LRB- thank God -RRB- department is chocolate styling gel The category also includes parsnip chips. <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zullo </PERSON>, both 40 and both residents of <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, say they met at a party five years ago and soon began building a `` cottage industry of shame.'' Since then, they have published five different sports-oriented `` Hall of Shame'' books, starting with `` The Baseball Hall of Shame.'' The business book took `` a solid three months of research and another few months to write,'' <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> said. Its official publication date is June 1, and the price is $ 7.95. In their book, <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zullo </PERSON> question <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>'s sincerity in urging everybody to `` buy American'' when he appears in ads clutching a cigar rolled in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> And they ask why <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reneged on a promise to mail first birthday cards to the 3.2 million Cabbage Patch Kids registered with the toy maker. The duo even counted up the many ways corporations say `` Layoffs.'' <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> once called them `` headcount reductions''; the accounting firm Peat, <ORGANIZATION> Marwick </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mitchell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> used the phrase `` requested departures''; and <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> called them `` workforce adjustments.'' Disasters that are particularly prickly for companies are those that involve the press. At one news conference that went awry, the president of Rival pet food chowed down a new all-beef dinner after a persnickety collie turned its nose up at the grub. For eager shareholders ready to head for the annual meeting, <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zullo </PERSON> suggest they buy a plane ticket and take along a map if they want to meet up with some elusive boards of directors. <ORGANIZATION> Schlumberger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> held its meeting on the island of <LOCATION> Curacao </LOCATION> in 1984 _ lots of shareholders there. And <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Host </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> held its 1967 meeting in the middle of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>, perhaps to accommodate any stock-owning mosquitoes. Some companies learned the hard way that it does n't always pay to go out of their way. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> once sent thank-you letters to wives of executives who had participated in the airline's `` Fly Your Wife Free'' campaign. But the airline was inundated with angry letters from outraged wives who had never flown their friendly skies. The spouses even demanded the names of their executive husbands' flying companions. <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zullo </PERSON> say the most important lesson businesses need to learn is not to fear mistakes. As for their next project, `` We do n't yet know where we'll look to uncover more shame,'' <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Esteemed Swedish Actor Turns To London Stage</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Swedish screen star <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON>, whose new film `` Pelle the Conqueror'' won the grand prize at the <ORGANIZATION> Cannes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>, is turning to the English stage in a career move he described as `` a great surprise.'' `` It's very exciting,'' the tall, lanky <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON> said of his upcoming role as <PERSON> Prospero </PERSON> in <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s `` The Tempest.'' The play opens Oct. 6 at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s Old Vic theater for a limited run through Nov. 26. The production, directed by <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, will mark <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON>'s first English-language appearance on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stage. He previously appeared in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1974 in a Swedish staging of <PERSON> Henrik </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibsen </PERSON>'s `` The Wild Duck.'' That production was directed by <PERSON> Ingmar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>, with whom <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON> has had a long and illustrious career on stage and in such films as `` The Seventh Seal,'' `` Wild Strawberries,'' `` Through a Glass Darkly'' and `` The Passion of <PERSON> Anna </PERSON>.'' On Broadway, <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON> has starred in two flops: `` The Night of the Tribades,'' with <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bibi </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON>, and `` Duet for One,'' with <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bancroft </PERSON>. `` It's a very interesting idea,'' <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON>, 58, said of director <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s choice that he play <PERSON> Prospero </PERSON>, a part more often associated with English actors in their twilight years. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, in a separate interview, explained his casting. `` I wanted to break out of the noble aria approach English performers often take to the part,'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who is in his first year as the artistic director of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s venerable Old <PERSON> Vic </PERSON>. `` I've never seen <PERSON> Max </PERSON> on stage, but I know he is a great, accomplished actor. I've seen all his films.'' <PERSON> Prospero </PERSON> furthers what has been an unusually busy year for <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON>. He is presently appearing at the National Theater of <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> in August <LOCATION> Strindberg </LOCATION>'s 1872 `` Master Olof.'' In Bille August's prize-winning Danish film, `` <PERSON> Pelle </PERSON> the Conqueror,'' <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON> heads up a family of immigrant farmworkers at the turn of the century, giving a performance for which he's won critical praise. The film won <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palme </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D'Or </LOCATION>, the top prize, at the 41st annual <ORGANIZATION> Cannes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> which ended on May 23. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON> was also represented at <LOCATION> Cannes </LOCATION> with his directorial debut, `` <PERSON> Katinka </PERSON>,'' adapted from a novel by the Danish author <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Bang </PERSON> about a three-way love affair. He said he had originally hoped to act in a movie version of the book when he first read the novel 25 years ago. Now, since he was too old for the male leads, he decided to direct the movie instead: `` Coincidence put the possibility in my hands.'' Of his English-language films, <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON> said he looked back fondly on `` <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON> and Her Sisters,'' <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s 1986 movie in which he played <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hershey </PERSON>'s tortured, irascible companion. `` Most of the scripts one gets are so bad it was wonderful to receive one with intelligent dialogue,'' said the actor, who felt challenged by <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s requirements. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> -RRB- demands 200 percent of a naturalistic style. He does not allow any literary phrasings or pronunciation,'' <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON> said. This version of `` The Tempest'' will mark the fourth major production of the play to be seen in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> this year; both the star and his director said they would not be seeing the others. `` It's very disturbing to be influenced,'' said <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON>, who last played <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s conjurer-poet in a Swedish production 35 years ago when, he said, he was `` much too young.'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said, `` I do n't go very much to the theater. It's too much of a busman's holiday.'' End Adv PM Fri June 3

<HEAD>Documentary Reveals War Not Over for Many Vietnam Vets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It would seem, in view of the much-visited <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veterans Memorial in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and the popularity of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> movies in the theaters and on TV, that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has finally welcomed the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran home. But as reported in the powerful <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> documentary `` The Wall Within'' this Thursday, as many as 1 million <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans have yet to leave behind a war that still terrorizes them every day, and little has been done to help them. Some have committed suicide and abused their families. Others suffer flashbacks, nightmares and withdrawal. CBS went to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, where many veterans who suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder have fled. The dense forests, perhaps reminiscent of the jungles of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, shelter them from a world where they can not speak of the atrocities they witnessed. `` They literally took to the hills,'' <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> anchor <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> said in an interview. Rather interviewed some of the veterans and narrates the documentary, which was produced and directed by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> and <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Fine </PERSON> and written by <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON>. `` I do n't want to have to be nobody all my life,'' says <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, one of the veterans interviewed for the documentary. `` I'd want to be able to come home, with some dignity. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s reward for his service in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> was overmedication as a paranoid schizophrenic that left him with organic brain damage. Other veterans tell of facing rejection and indifference when they returned from combat. `` This hour that we do, this is not the movie ` Platoon.' This is real stuff,'' said Rather. `` These are real people struggling to recover from real wounds.'' Another of the veterans interviewed describes how he almost killed his mother when she woke him one morning and he thought she was the enemy. Some of the veterans are beginning to deal with <ORGANIZATION> PTSD </ORGANIZATION> in the only way they can, by talking to other veterans in rap groups sponsored by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans centers, many of which will soon be closed due to lack of funding. One reason some of the veterans talked to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> was because Rather had been in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> as a reporter. `` They wo n't even consider talking to somebody who did n't go to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` It was slow going to even get them to talk to us. So my reporting from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> was a help.'' Rather said he also had to listen to a lot of complaints about how the war was reported. One veteran took Rather on a flashlight visit to the small, unlit room he keeps at the back of his basement where the walls are covered with rough drawings, like a cave-dweller's, depicting his <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> nightmares. `` As very young people they were plunged into a green jungle hell,'' said Rather. `` They saw terrible and horrific things. They saw these things done to others, done to themselves. Then suddenly they are jerked back and dumped back into a country where in many cases they were despised, humiliated, criticized, and still very young. Is it any wonder that they suffered a psychological wound that is deep and abiding?'' Another veteran suffers from a symptom of PTSD called `` hypervigilance.'' He recalls with great difficulty watching a buddy die on the deck of an aircraft carrier because he was not alert enough. So he patrols incessantly at night, driving city streets or back roads in his truck. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> suffers from flashbacks. Viewers, like Rather, will be moved to reach out physically to <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> as he breaks down while he struggles to describe the aftermath of an enemy attack. `` I noticed the sergeant kinda laying over some of the pipes over there. I knew he was hurt, and he'd always kinda come around and showed us a picture of his family _ his wife, his little boy and little girl. He was just laying over there, and I thought, God, no one's helpin' this guy, and I ran over there to help him and reached down and grabbed him and he was, um, he was, um, he was blown in half. He was b-b-blown in half. It was just his top half. It was just his top half left. ...'' He breaks down into sobs. `` He's healing,'' assures Rather. `` He's healing because until now he could n't tell this story to anyone. He had his flashbacks alone.'' CBS seems to have helped the healing somewhat by bringing three of the veterans, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaelson </PERSON>, to the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veterans Memorial where they wept as they found the names of buddies they lost in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. It is these moving scenes, shot just before dawn, that conclude the documentary, to the strains of `` Appalachian Spring.''

<TEXT>
 Talking about money is something that just was n't done in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> until only a few years ago Now, because of Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s capitalist revolution, business, economics and personal finance are increasingly popular subjects on British television. The number of television hours devoted to money matters has grown to more than 200 a year from about 30 hours annually just four years ago. `` Business is suddenly a much more interesting topic,'' said <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON>, independent Channel 4's commissioning editor for business, industry and science. The new shows have included a daily news show, a game show and even a dramatic series. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s two publicly funded <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> channels and two independent channels are all thinking money, but the biggest push has been made by Channel 4. In September it introduced `` Business Daily,'' a half-hour news program airing at midday Monday through Friday and targeted at professionals in the <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s financial district. In addition, Channel 4 introduced in January a Sunday night game show, `` The Stocks and Shares Show,'' in which contestants compete to make the most profit by investing play money in stocks. Channel 4 also recently ran a live weekly series called `` The Business Exchange,'' which gave advice to some of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s budding entrepreneurs on how to get financing and other topics. Also unusual was a six-part weekly dramatic series set in the City, rather than more typically in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s swanky neighborhoods, the cockney East End or the government's labyrinthian buildings. Called `` Killing on the Exchange,'' it ran on <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>'s main channel in prime time last year. `` There has been a big change in attitude in the past five years toward business with privatization and the Big Bang explosion in the City,'' Ms. <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has privatized, or sold off, billions of pounds' worth of nationalized industries since she came into power in 1979, partly to get more shares into the hands of the British public The number of individual shareholders in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has trebled to 7 million in the nine years. Big Bang, most of which took place in October 1986, was a huge deregulation and computerization of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s financial services industry. `` Now, in Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, people can talk about profit without it being a dirty word,'' Ms. <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> said. Not all television viewers have been capitivated by these money matters programs. Ms. <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> conceded that talking about personal finances is still taboo for many Britons. `` The respectable thing in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is not to talk about finances, even how much they paid for a house. There are all sorts of traditions about not revealing how much you earn.'' she said. `` That's part of the British being rather buttoned-up people.'' The husband of a woman interviewed for `` Moneyspinner,'' a Channel 4 personal finances program, had a fit when he found out about it and insisted that the interview be deleted, Ms. <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> said. Still, `` Moneyspinner,'' which appears Tuesday nights in series of eight programs, is the most popular of the money shows on Channel 4, attracting about 2 million viewers. `` The Stocks and Shares Show'' has its detractors, too. `` It's caused more controversy than anything else I've done,'' Ms. <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> said. Critics feel the channel should n't encourage speculation, she said. The innovative programming comes on top of an increase in the number of more traditional types of money matters shows, such as the weekly current affairs programs and the odd documentary on, for example, insider trading. The oldest and most popular money program on British television is <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> 2's 22-year-old `` The Money Programme,'' a current-affairs show viewed by almost 3 million people on Sunday evenings. The show features hosts conducting studio interviews with business-world celebrities and expanded segments on newsworthy topics. The trend is evident in the theater, too. Currently running are the British plays `` Serious Money,'' which is also playing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and `` Speculators.''

<HEAD>Best-selling Writer Scores Another Triumph</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN FISCHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Austrian best-selling writer <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmel </PERSON> churns out the kind of pop novels West Germans love to read in secret. His crime and romance tales have captivated the general public but horrified many highbrow critics and intellectuals. In the last 40 years they have called <PERSON> Simmel </PERSON> everything from a `` cliche factory'' to an `` opium for the masses.'' The popular author remains unruffled, however. His books have made him one of the world's best-selling German-language writers. More than 65 million copies of his novels have been sold around the world, appearing in 25 languages, including English. His latest work, a thriller about gene technologists bent on world destruction, has been high on national best-seller lists since it hit the market last August. The book is also selling well in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and the Scandinavian countries, where <PERSON> Simmel </PERSON> has been popular for years. `` The only country where they have this terrible schoolteacher-type criticism of my work is <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' the 64-year-old Austrian said in an interview. Notice from other countries include a <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmel </PERSON> collection of the author's more than 20 works at the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> library. <PERSON> Simmel </PERSON>'s current best seller is `` But With Clowns Came the Tears,'' which focuses on the AIDS epidemic and the dangers of gene technology. It was released by the Munich-based Droemer-Knaur Verlag publishing house and has not yet been scheduled for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In the book the superpowers are locked in a battle over genetic and viral manipulation techniques that could determine the fate of the world. `` Contemporary issues have always been the driving force of my work,'' <PERSON> Simmel </PERSON> said. `` My novels are not really novels; they are a combination of fact and fiction. `` It would be a crime to just write fiction when there are so many horrible things happening in the world, important issues people should be made aware of.'' In novels and screenplays <PERSON> Simmel </PERSON> has treated such themes as alcoholism -LRB- he is a recovered alcoholic -RRB-, education of the psychologically disturbed and fascism and the Nazi period. `` I will write against <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> and neo-Nazis as long as I live. To me they are the greatest criminals in history,'' <PERSON> Simmel </PERSON> said, adding that the Nazi period was one of the worst of his life. During most of the war he was a chemist in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. One work dealing with the Nazi era, `` The <LOCATION> Monte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cristo </LOCATION> Cover-Up,'' made <PERSON> Simmel </PERSON> famous in the early 1960s. The often humorous account of a wartime cook and spy included numerous gourmet recipes. <PERSON> Simmel </PERSON> partly attributes his focus on current events to his roots as a journalist. He spent years as a reporter for the Austrian daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abend </ORGANIZATION> and the West German weekly newsmagazine Quick. The writer said journalism has also influenced his painstaking research methods. <PERSON> Simmel </PERSON> spends up to a year gathering facts for a book. `` I traveled to several countries researching gene technology, for example, talking to experts,'' he said. But contemporary relevance and authenticity alone are not what makes his books sell, he readily admits. `` My trick is to report about these grave issues and package them in an entertaining story,'' <PERSON> Simmel </PERSON> said. His new book opens with a circus performance where clowns suddenly shoot into the audience. The clowns were hired to kill a noted geneticist who was at the show but they also hit the child of a news reporter. She immediately gets on the case. As in every `` Simmel,'' as his books are called, there is a love story, this time between the reporter and a scientist pulled into the chain of events. And it is precisely the entertainment side of his work that has given <PERSON> Simmel </PERSON> trouble with critics and the more literary minded. `` Many people here do n't like to admit they enjoy <PERSON> Simmel </PERSON>,'' Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung critic <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Schirrmacher </PERSON> said in an interview. `` It's not seen as ` intellectual' enough.'' <PERSON> Schirrmacher </PERSON> said the embarrassment is due to a serious-minded German literary tradition. `` There's no tradition in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> of entertaining literature that's also considered high quality,'' <PERSON> Schirrmacher </PERSON> said. `` Literature here has to be complicated, not easily understood, in order to be respected.'' The gray-haired, bespectacled <PERSON> Simmel </PERSON> lives in <LOCATION> Zug </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, which he said he now regards as his home. His wife died of cancer in 1985.

<HEAD>`ET' Host Gives Showgirl Role A Try</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT MACY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> was growing up in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, her mother often worried about the future `` Entertainment Tonight'' host running away to become a showgirl. Well, Mom, do n't look now, but ... The perky blonde, who taught high school English and piano while doing community theater and dreaming of a show business career, recently made her stage debut in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. With more bookings here and in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, plus summer stock and music festivals this summer, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s ready to continue her dual professional role, although she'd just as soon skip those 18-hour days, juggling two careers in two cities. Her grueling daily grind _ shuttling between this city's <LOCATION> Glitter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulch </LOCATION> for her long-awaited fling at singing and dancing, then back to a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> `` ET'' set for more TV patter _ gave new meaning to the concept of commuting to work. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> realized a lifelong dream when she spent two weeks appearing with comedian <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brenner </PERSON> at the Golden Nugget Hotel and Casino earlier this month. But she admits she would n't care for a steady diet of the double duty. `` I performed at 8 and again at 11,'' she said. `` Then I caught a 1 a.m. flight to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, and hit the house about 2:45. I got up at 7:30 and was at Paramount -LRB- where ` ET' is filmed -RRB- by 8 a.m.. We did our promos and other spots, then began taping the show at 11:30 a.m.. At 2:45 in the afternoon I was on a flight back to `` Both worlds is not an ideal situation,'' she laughed as she relaxed between shows during her two-week engagement. `` It's conceivable to do one show a night and commute for a short period of time. In her show, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> does several dance numbers and displays a surprisingly good singing voice. Her appearance and style are reminiscent of Ann-Margret when she was a <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> headliner for years. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s sexy legs _ insured by <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> for $ 2 million _ are amply displayed in the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> show. The legs are a product of a lot of hard work, including a treadmill, rowing machine and Exercycle at home, 25 miles of speed-walking a week, and aerobics and dance classes. She admits that coming into this town with a nationally known name did n't hurt her chances for success. But she thinks she had to have more than just a pretty, recognizable face _ and $ 2 million legs. `` You know, you're putting it all on the line when you come in here as a co-headliner,'' she said. `` There's no way of hiding it. But I wanted to do it. I was both exhilarated and intimidated by the experience.'' Her song-and-dance debut has given her a new appreciation of the people she covers on ` ET.' `` There's a lot of rejection and hard knocks. I'm far more appreciative for having experienced it firsthand.'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> admits to something of a <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitty </PERSON> lifestyle since her days in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. She's been a finalist in the Miss America Pageant -LRB- 1971 -RRB-, been a host of `` ET'' for five years, sparred with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>, sung the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anthem </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> games, ridden with the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> flight team, danced on the Emmy awards show, injured one leg in a fall from the high wire on a `` Circus of the Stars'' performance and been co-host of the Tournament of Roses Parade coverage and the `` Regis Philbin Show.'' Despite all those credits she thinks her stage debut at the Golden Nugget was one of her toughest gigs. `` I prepared for the opening for months,'' she recalled. `` Then the day of the opening, after working all afternoon in dress rehearsals, I almost felt like I could n't do it. I proceeded to cry for three hours. `` Part of it was sheer fear; part of it was excitement. There were moments of being panic-stricken. But the overriding emotion was one of exhilaration. `` I have really always seen myself as an entertainer,'' she said. `` You dream those things, but you do n't know for sure if they'll ever happen. I think that was part of my emotionalism, realizing those things had come true.'' A few dreams _ a Broadway play and her own TV sitcom _ remain unfulfilled. But, at age 35, she thinks time is on her side. She's learned to roll with the punches, to be patient. After doing radio and TV talk shows in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rapids </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, she moved West to headline `` PM Magazine.'' She left that show to co-host `` <ORGANIZATION> Regis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philbin </ORGANIZATION>'' _ which folded four months later. `` I was out of work and out of money,'' she recalled. `` That was a time I was terribly disappointed. Then ET came along. Thank heaven for my Midwestern upbringing, and positive thinking. `` My parents always told me that the bad times accentuate the good. I've always translated the negative experiences into good in the long run. I'm a big believer that life goes on. You get back from life what you put into it.''

<HEAD>Unleashing Some Beastly Equipment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Guitarist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Abercrombie </PERSON> stood in a tangle of foot switches and wires on stage at the Jazz Showcase, nodding toward a guitar synthesizer and bank of boxes sparkling with twinkling lights behind him. He introduced his next number, adding it would be his last before he `` unleashed all this beastly equipment.'' By today's standards of sound processing, it was a modest-looking collection of electronic wizardry, including his synthesizer, a digital reverb and delay and a stereo chorus in addition to his Ibanez guitar and standard power amplifier and pre-amplifier. Yet there was one of the most progressive jazz guitar stylists feeling his way through the technical forest. It was clear evidence that music technology can outstrip a musician's ability to adapt it to his playing. `` I like it,'' <PERSON> Abercrombie </PERSON> said of advances in music technology. `` It's frustrating, but definitely it's another instrument. The synthesizer makes me hear differently. It makes me compose differently. `` It becomes another way to express yourself and that's what you want to do.'' <PERSON> Abercrombie </PERSON> and trio mates <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Erskine </PERSON> on drums and <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> on bass were in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> recently at the start of a 2 -LCB- - week tour of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, South and East <PERSON> Abercrombie </PERSON>, 43, lives in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He's been a force in guitar improvisation for most of the 20 years he has spent touring the world. Advances in music technology are another step in the evolution of jazz, which has progressed partly through a oneupsmanship philosophy, he said in an interview. During the be-bop era that was the style du jour. `` It was n't technology, but it's keeping up with the <ORGANIZATION> Joneses </ORGANIZATION> until the next cat comes along and says, ` I want to do something different,''' he said. Advances in technology also have helped <PERSON> Abercrombie </PERSON> in his own music. `` I think overall, this technology has helped my guitar playing. I think it has made me a more fluid player and made me appreciate the guitar more,'' he said. Appreciation _ at least popular and commercial appreciation _ still elude <PERSON> Abercrombie </PERSON>, although he claims no hardship. A steady player and recording artist for German-based <ORGANIZATION> ECM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Abercrombie </PERSON> acknowledges his music is n't easily grasped by an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public that defines jazz as `` more pop-oriented'' music. <PERSON> Abercrombie </PERSON>'s playing is easily described as eclectic. A blues riff might give way to introspective brooding before rising to rock-level decibels. He'll toss in a hook from a jazz standard for good measure. European jazz fans seem to accept <PERSON> Abercrombie </PERSON> more than their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> counterparts, he says. `` I think my music has always been a little off to the weird side,'' <PERSON> Abercrombie </PERSON> said. `` It's not always music people sit down and listen to. It all has to do with accessibility. `` I think the music I choose to play is less accessible to many people,'' he said. `` It's more important for me and the people I know to try to expand'' the jazz tradition `` And if that means using technology, I will.'' But there is a price to pay for relying on the new machines, said <PERSON> Abercrombie </PERSON>, who counts as his primary influences traditionalists <PERSON> Wes </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>. `` You do realize that synthesizers will drain you if you use them all the time,'' he said. And he has some advice for the wizards who create music technology: `` What I'd like to say is, ` Why do n't you guys slow down and let us learn how to play what we've got?' The thing I do n't like is every three months something new comes out.''

 Some <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> stars are beginning to shine for favored candidates in the June 7 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> primary election, but many Democratic celebrities remain uncommitted in a race complicated by <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s anti-Jewish image. Not that big money is n't being raised. Nor is all the glitter gone. For example, radio personality <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasem </PERSON> and his actress wife, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON>, are hosts for a celebrity fund-raiser for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on June 5 at trendy <LOCATION> Spago </LOCATION> restaurant, known for its unconventional <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> pizzas. Among those expected to attend the $ 1,000-a-slice, Western-theme party are <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON>, <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoo </PERSON>. Hollywood support is often vigorously sought by political candidates, who know stars attract attention, money and _ they hope _ voters to a campaign. On the Republican side, where the race was over long ago, <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stack </PERSON> and producer <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Weintraub </PERSON> have endorsed Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, while <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON>, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Oscar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Renta </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Yvette </PERSON> <PERSON> Mimieux </PERSON> have made contributions to his campaign, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s deputy finance chairman, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But things are messier among the Democrats. So far this season, <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Field </PERSON>, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gere </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Begley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Randall </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carly </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimoy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON> <PERSON> Winters </PERSON> have endorsed <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic front-runner, according to the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's local spokesman, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Devereaux </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has attracted many black celebrities to his camp, including comedians <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> as well as <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Gossett </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gladys </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>. And some white performers have pledged their support, including <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>, <PERSON> Margot </PERSON> <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>. However, most <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> _ the show business community's dominant party _ have yet to endorse either <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> or <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` Hollywood has always been mostly Jewish and liberal,'' said <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Block </PERSON>, editor of Show Biz News, a twice-monthly newsletter covering the business side of the entertainment industry. `` From a Jewish point of view, it's almost unconscionable to support <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>,'' he said. However, neither is there any public rush to oppose the black civil rights activist who is the most liberal candidate in the race. Rabbi <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hier </PERSON>, dean of the <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wiesenthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said Jews in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> are caught between black friends who are asking them to consider <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> friends who say they must oppose him. `` People are caught. Anyone who endorses <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will not be thought of as a hero in the Jewish community,'' <PERSON> Hier </PERSON> said. `` Among conservative Jewish people in this industry, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is simply unacceptable,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Medved </PERSON>, film critic for PBS' `` Sneak Previews'' and president of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> Jewish Center. `` The feeling is so intense, friendships would be so imperiled and business would be imperiled.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> alienated many Jews by referring to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as `` Hymietown'' in 1984, by publicly embracing <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and by being associated with <PERSON> Muslim </PERSON> leader <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>. The uncommitted Hollywood group includes such activists as two-time Oscar winner <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Assemblyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>; <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lear </PERSON>, Emmy Award-winning producer of television's `` The Archie Bunker Show,'' and <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasserman </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> They were among those on Show Biz News' list of the 10 most powerful political fund-raisers in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lear </PERSON>, whose political organization, `` People for the American Way,'' mounted a nationwide campaign to defeat the nomination of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, is busy with his new production company, <PERSON> Act </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, said his spokeswoman, <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON>. `` When you jump into a presidential campaign, it takes a lot of work and commitment, and he does n't feel compelled to do so at this time,'' Ms. <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> said. Miss <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> has been in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> since January filming `` Old Gringo'' with co-stars <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Smits </PERSON>. `` She has no plans to endorse anyone before the primary,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON>. `` Her mind is in 1913 -LRB- the time period of the movie -RRB-. But she says she will support the Democratic nominee.'' <PERSON> Medved </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Haydens </ORGANIZATION> face a `` Catch 22'' with the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> issue: If he and Miss <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> support <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, they risk offending <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>'s largely Jewish <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> constituency. If the couple does not support <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> could find himself at odds with his political leader, Assembly Speaker <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who is <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s national campaign manager, and with his longtime seatmate in the Assembly chambers, Assemblyman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, who is co-chairman of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> campaign. Another observer, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON>, an official in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Attorney </LOCATION>'s Office who was deputy campaign manager of <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s first 1988 presidential campaign, said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is not really the issue. `` Most of the people in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, both the executives and celebrities, were either committed to <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> or -LRB- Sen. -RRB- <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>. Both those campaigns blew up. There was a sense of not wanting to be burned again so they wanted to wait out the primary. But they will throw themselves into the -LRB- November -RRB- presidential race,'' said <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON>, who now supports <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Asner </PERSON> is `` on the verge'' of supporting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Telly </PERSON> <PERSON> Savalas </PERSON> also likes him, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamakos </PERSON>, spokesman for both stars. Conservative Republicans in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> are few, but the ones who are active are expected to work for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, including <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Heston </PERSON>. `` He will be supporting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, but he wo n't make an announcement until after the nomination,'' said <PERSON> Heston </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON> also remains uncommitted, but the tough-guy star of the `` Rocky'' and `` Rambo'' series `` did vote for Mr. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, whom he admires greatly,'' said <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Block </PERSON>. `` He has n't declared yet.

<HEAD>Technology May Help Farmers Cope With Environmental Crackdown,
Says USDA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Government environmental regulations are having an impact on the lives of virtually all Americans and are especially affecting farmers and the way they handle soil and water resources. Farmers should be helped to use the `` tremendous stream of technology'' coming out of laboratories to work within the regulatory world, says <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Spitz </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s new <ORGANIZATION> Working </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemicals </ORGANIZATION> and the Environment. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> historically has operated world-class research facilities. It still does, as the records attest. But in recent decades the private sector has often been on the cutting edge of change, leaving <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> to basic research and long-range development. Meanwhile, as Americans become more conscious of the natural environment and how it can be affected by manmade chemicals and use of resources, new restrictions emerge from local, state and federal regulators. It is high time, many say, that <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> assert its leadership role and help teach farmers to work within the new system that will guide them tomorrow, like it or not. `` We need to move more aggressively as a department in technology,'' <PERSON> Spitz </PERSON> said in an interview. `` What we've got to do is move -LRB- on -RRB- our technology and our ability to guide producers. Instead of saying, you ca n't do this, you ca n't do that, -LRB- we'll have to say -RRB- here's the setting and here's what you can do ... here's the technology that you need to continue to operate. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> ca n't afford to stand on the sidelines, he said. The department and the network of land-grant universities and experiment stations represent `` a major force, a major player'' in the environmental, technological revolution at hand. `` If we're looking at cropland and production agriculture _ and these regulations are closing in on that _ we really must upgrade our technology and our capability ... to respond,'' <PERSON> Spitz </PERSON> said. But is n't a lot of technology already available to farmers, making it easier for them to abide by the new state and federal environmental restrictions? `` In some of the newer technologies _ integrated pest management, biotechnology in genetics _ and in some of the farming practices themselves, there's quite a bit coming out of applied research,'' he said. `` We need to get it out into the demonstration areas and on farms so it's visible to the American producer.'' So its a rather old and familiar story, at least in the research establishment, the state and county extension service and among innovative farmers themselves: if it works and can make money, it'll catch on. `` If it's going to be accepted, profit is the bottom line,'' <PERSON> Spitz </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> group that <PERSON> Spitz </PERSON> heads was formed in early February. Among its purposes is to review <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> policies regarding agricultural chemicals and report on the effectiveness and appropriateness of those policies. Another goal will be to develop `` appropriate strategies'' for carrying out new or amended policies relating to farm chemicals and the environment. Deputy Secretary <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, <PERSON> Spitz </PERSON>'s boss and <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s second in command, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee last week that the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has adopted two new groundwater strategies for pesticides and nitrates. In the case of pesticides, <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said, the agency plan calls for specific areas of research, including the use of minimum or conservation tillage practices, computer models to help select the best farm management practices, integrated pest management, improved pesticide application, water and pesticide management for irrigated or poorly drained cropland and new technologies for pesticide analysis and decontamination. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel that the strategic plan for nitrates `` recognizes the important role nitrogen fertilizers play in modern agriculture and provides a balanced approach that allows their continued use in crop production in a manner that minimizes the movement of nitrogen into ground water.'' Environmental advocates have often criticized heavy fertilizer use as a source of pollution from water running off fields into streams. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> conservation programs also have elevated water quality into a top priority. The 1985 farm law, he said, set up the long-term Conservation Reserve Program, or CRP, for converting highly erodible cropland to protective grass or trees for 10 years. The <ORGANIZATION> CRP </ORGANIZATION> and other provisions `` will significantly reduce sediment from cropland that previously entered the nation's streams and rivers,'' <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said. `` It has been estimated that sediment pollution from cropland can be reduced as much as 30 to 40 percent annually by these provisions.'' Further, he said, as sediment levels are lowered, pesticides and nutrients attached to those particles will be reduced.

<HEAD>African National Congress Attracts Some South African Whites</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Despite repeated setbacks, the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> presses on with military and underground efforts to unseat the apartheid government. Some of its new guerrilla recruits are young whites. `` There is a continuing trend of young, well-educated liberal and left-wing whites to identify themselves with the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lodge </PERSON>, a political scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witwatersrand </ORGANIZATION> and an expert on the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>. Increasingly, he added, the whites see the organization as `` a legitimate and morally admirable political force.'' Police say they have seized <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> whites with caches of arms, arrested another in a car bombing and charged at least one with treason. But <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> military activities have diminished. In the past year, bombings in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> have declined, police have claimed major breakthroughs against <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas, and even the organization's leaders have conceded that its military actions were more effective during the widespread unrest of 1984-86. <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas generally operate in small groups and have little hope of scoring conventional victories against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s powerful security forces However, the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> says its bombing and sabotage campaign remains an essential element of its multi-pronged strategy to oust the white-led government. `` We must step up our attacks on the police, the army and other personnel associated with the institution -LRB- government -RRB-,'' <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Tambo </PERSON> said in March in neighboring, black-governed <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>. `` We will strike against its economic infrastructure and do much more intensively what we have been doing all the time.'' However, the talk has not been matched by action. Two years ago, the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> was claiming that it had enough popular support in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to direct a `` people's power'' campaign that would make the country ungovernable. But since the government imposed a nationwide state of emergency in June 1986, black unrest has dwindled from daily outbursts across the country to sporadic, isolated incidents. <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> activity has declined simultaneously. Fifty bombings were reported in the first year of the emergency but only about 20 in the past 11 months. Police say that since the beginning of 1987 they have killed 54 suspected <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> members and captured 525, inflicting major setbacks to <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> operations inside <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` Terrorists who are sent to the republic -LRB- <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> -RRB- are going on suicide missions, because confrontation with the security forces means either certain death or a long period of imprisonment,'' said <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>, the government's law and order minister. However, the recent defeats do not appear to have hampered the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to recruit members into its military wing, known as Umkhonto we Sizwe -LRB- Spear of the Nation -RRB-. `` People do n't join the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> if they are worried about setbacks,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebina </PERSON>, a spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>. `` People have joined _ and they continue to join _ because they are committed to our liberation struggle.'' The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> refuses to say what its membership is, but it is variously estimated at 4,000 to 10,000 men with military training, most of whom are in camps in <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. No more than a few hundred are believed to be inside <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Whites always have had some role in <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> political activities, some of them in its upper echelons, but spokesman <PERSON> Sebina </PERSON> said the involvement of young whites has been growing in the 1980s, though he declined to give any figures. When police arrested four whites May 8 at a farmhouse outside <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, they claimed their largest arms seizure ever. The whites had a Soviet-made SAM-7 ground-to-air missile, limpet mines, hand grenades, machine guns, mortars and explosives, the police said. The leading suspect in a car bombing that killed three people March 17 is a 24-year-old white man whose father is a university journalism professor. In <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Schreiner </PERSON>, a 31-year-old white whose father is a university administrator, is on trial with 12 black co-defendants charged with treason and terrorism. The government portrays the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> as a communist-led terrorist group that kills civilians and lacks widespread support and political legitimacy. `` The conviction that the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is conducting a futile struggle is already taking root in the their ranks,'' said <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>, the law and order minister. The government also claims the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is torn by internal strife, that numerous of its defectors have joined the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> police force and that the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> keeps its dissidents in at an `` inhuman'' detention camp in northern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sebina </PERSON> denied those claims. He said South African agents, not internal <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> feuding, were behind the six killings this year of <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> officials living outside <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. He disclaimed any knowledge of recent defections by ranking <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> members and said the organization did not maintain detention camps for dissidents. `` The government has been making similar noises for a long time,'' said <PERSON> Sebina </PERSON>. `` They said our back was broken when we were outlawed -LRB- in 1960 -RRB-. They said the same thing when -LRB- <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> was arrested -LRB- in 1962 -RRB-. One or two defeats will not end our struggle.'' <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leader at the time of his arrest, is in prison but remains a rallying point for the organization and the large majority of blacks. Founded in 1912 as a black rights movement, the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> took up arms in 1961, the year after it was banned, saying it was left with no alternative. It is the largest black group fighting the government, and it is widely believed that the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> would win national elections if the country's 26 million blacks were allowed to vote. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> has offices in many African nations as well as <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in hopes of advancing its political fortunes. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> has been drawing up a new set of guidelines for a post-apartheid constitution that is reported to be their most detailed political document ever. The Weekly Mail newspaper of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> said the proposal calls for a mixed economy, a bill of rights and a multi-party government. It also calls for equalizing wealth, a sensitive issue in a country where blacks make up about 75 percent of the population but own less than 2 percent of the country's fixed assets. The most contentious issue involving the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> remains its use of violence. The government says it wo n't talk to the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> until it lays down its arms. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> says the arms are necessary to bring the government into genuine negotiations. `` There has been no reassessment of the armed struggle,'' said <PERSON> Sebina </PERSON>. `` There are still bombs exploding here and there, and I'm sure there will be more of them.

<DATELINE>SKOBALJ, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Radisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovic </PERSON>, a farmer's son, left this sleepy village for college 10 years ago with dreams of `` a normal life'' _ having a car and an apartment in the city. What he did n't know then, however, was that his country's economy would falter under the weight of heavy borrowing, bad investment and a mounting debt Today he is back on the farm, one of millions of young Yugoslavs forced to depend on their parents for economic survival. <PERSON> Petrovic </PERSON>, 30, who married a law student at the university in nearby <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, now is driving his father's old Soviet-made car. His wife, <PERSON> Tanja </PERSON>, has joined more than 1 million Yugoslavs who are out of work, staying at home with an 18-month-old daughter instead of defending court cases. As an agrarian manager on a state-run pig farm, <PERSON> Petrovic </PERSON> earns an above-average 370,000 dinar -LRB- $ 250 -RRB- a month. It does n't go far in an inflation of 170 percent and an economy burdened by a $ 21 billion foreign debt the Communist government is strapped to pay. `` My monthly salary lasts three days,'' joked <PERSON> Petrovic </PERSON>. `` Twenty if I'm really economical. After that, <PERSON> Papa </PERSON> must come with his money.'' The Petrovics rarely eat out. The traditional vacation on the <LOCATION> Adriatic </LOCATION> will happen this year only if a relative lends them a seaside home and the couple finds the money to repair the Soviet car. On the surface, life in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> sometimes seems blissfully untouched by the economic woes. Bars and cafes in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, the capital, are always full. The young dress with style. Cars and Western gadgets are conspicuous. Behind that facade, however, living standards have dropped one-third since 1980 when Yugoslavs thought they had something to look ahead to. The inflation that Premier <PERSON> Branko </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> has called a destructive evil is eating away at the fragile infrastructure of a nation constantly troubled by ethnic tensions among peoples divided in six different republics and using two different alphabets, Roman and cyrillic. Many of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s 23 million citizens depend for survival on the only structures left intact _ the traditional bonds between family and friends, and age-old ties to the land. `` People who live with their parents live much better than those who do n't,'' <PERSON> Petrovic </PERSON> told a visitor. `` Being dependent on your parents, you have a chance to sit in a car, live a bit normally. If you separate ... forget a car, forget a TV, forget everything.'' The 300 families of Skobalj are relatively well off on the fertile land along the <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION> southeast of <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>. But even they say times are getting hard, and they angrily criticize the Communist hierarchy's policy of curbing farming output. `` This is the worst situation I can remember,'' said <PERSON> Borivoje </PERSON> <PERSON> Stojadinovic </PERSON>, 65, who has farmed here all his life. Sitting out on his porch, sipping coffee with visitors, <PERSON> Stojadinovic </PERSON> recalled selling a bull in 1938 for 4,000 dinars. `` You could have bought half the village,'' he said. Now, 4,000 dinars is barely worth $ 3. A decade ago, <PERSON> Stojadinovic </PERSON> added, the sale of a bull provided his home with a refrigerator and washing machine. Now, he added, `` I'd need two bulls _ one for each.'' He and his wife <PERSON> Radmila </PERSON>, 62, sold two of their 17 acres of land years back to finance the education of their two daughters, one now a doctor and the other an engineer in different Serbian cities. Both are married. But both still depend on their increasingly frail parents to survive. `` I ca n't send money,'' the father said. `` But just the other day I sent one of them a nice, fat pig.'' The Stojadinovics would like to lease out land they ca n't farm for extra cash. Down the lane, <PERSON> Dusan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pantic </PERSON> would like to rent it to graze his prize-winning cows and expand the farm he runs with his wife and son. But the rent Pantic would be able to pay would n't cover taxes and other state levies, <PERSON> Stojadinovic </PERSON> said. Communist authorities curb expansion for successful farmers like <PERSON> Pantic </PERSON>, forbidding any peasant to farm more than 25 acres of land. Former university student <PERSON> Petrovic </PERSON>, sitting at the kitchen table of his father's farmhouse, railed against such rules. `` They should take a look at what the Western world did with agriculture,'' he said. A prize cow in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, he added, yields less than one quarter of the milk of an average cow in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Ninety percent of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s agriculture is in the hands of private farmers like <PERSON> Petrovic </PERSON>'s father. `` But there are no good, stimulating measures for private producers here,'' <PERSON> Petrovic </PERSON> said, advocating new measures to create bigger, more efficient farms. Like many other reforms in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, planned improvements in farming have run awry. <PERSON> Petrovic </PERSON> cited a plan to give loans to farmers whose investments yield slow returns and who must sell produce to the state at prices that lag behind inflation. `` The wrong people got the credits,'' <PERSON> Petrovic </PERSON> said. `` They have nothing to do with agriculture and just use the money to build houses and buy cars.'' Asked why, <PERSON> Petrovic </PERSON> flashed the knowing smile of someone accustomed to a nation where connections and power open doors. `` We have some strange laws,'' he said. `` The law here is not a law if there are no exceptions.'' A few miles up river in the village of <LOCATION> Grocka </LOCATION>, the wealth of local officials is on show. Mercedes cars sit in the driveways of their weekend homes and in the parking lot of a local restaurant favored by the late President <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>. The only other people not suffering around Skobalj are those who went off to work in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, like a million other Yugoslavs, and have returned to build brick houses. `` Most of the people who went abroad in earlier years were poor and uneducated,'' <PERSON> Petrovic </PERSON> said. `` They went because of the hard economic situation for them. Now, they are coming back richer and cleverer than all the people left here.'' He said a schoolfriend went to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> years ago to play handball. `` Now, he drives a Porsche.''

 When an assassin took <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s life 20 years ago, robbing the nation of a rising leader, he also stole the father from 11 children _ the oldest 16, the youngest not yet born While drugs and other personal tragedies have torn at some of their lives, destroying one, many of the children of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> have gone on to embrace their father's ideals and pick up his torch of public service. `` This is how they're dealing with'' their father's death, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON>, curator at the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and a longtime <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> family friend. `` They think -LRB- public service -RRB- is the way. They have the same compassion for the underprivileged that their father had. ... They care.'' The Kennedy children remember their father for his dedication to the country, his sense of discipline, his love for life. `` I remember when my uncle -LRB- <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> -RRB- died, one of the family rituals was discussing current events, and we often had to write something about what was taking plce on the front pages of the papers,'' recalled <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, 30, the sixth of the RFK children. `` I remember my father turning to my older siblings and telling them to write down the significance of this event on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and history. That must have taken a tremendous amount of self-discipline for such a personal event. Yet we always had _ going skiing, rafting _ just so many fun times as well. `` Thinking about raising my own family, these are the thoughts that go through your mind,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, who with his wife, <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON>, a daughter of sports commentator <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Gifford </PERSON>, has three children. His sisters and brothers are: <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON>, 36; <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, 35; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 34; <PERSON> Courtney </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhe </PERSON>, 31; <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, 28; <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, 24; <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, 23; <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, 21; and <PERSON> Rory </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, 19. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was 28 when he died in 1984. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, who like his father attended <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, runs <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the non-profit oil company started by brother <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> to help the poor get low-cost heat. `` Growing up in my family, it was clear that you had to give something back, not only to your family and your community, but your country. Whether that came directly from my father, or as much from my mother, I guess it's a basic Christian attitude,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> said. He took over Citizens Energy after <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> two years ago won the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> congressional seat once held by their uncle <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> and their grandfather. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> was a fund-raiser for the campaign. Rep. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> has been asked by his mother to deliver the eulogy at a memorial Mass on Monday at <ORGANIZATION> RFK </ORGANIZATION>'s gravesite at the <ORGANIZATION> Arlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION>, said aide <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> refused repeated requests for an interview. He and his wife, <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Rauch </PERSON>, have twins. <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> presides over the family estate, <PERSON> Hickory </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, located in this <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suburb and has organized memorials. She generally prefers to have her children speak for the family. Daughter <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> lawyer, said her father `` believed that politics is an honorable profession, and I think that's why so many of his children are interested in politics. He believed that we should each do our best. He had a sense of justice and injustice, and if things were wrong one should not just sit idly by, but do something about it.'' She said she will likely run for office again following her 1986 congressional defeat to a Republican incumbent. Meanwhile, she directs a community service program for high school students at the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. Chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, she is married to professor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON> and they have three children. <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> graduate, was field director of her brother's 1986 campaign. Earlier this year, she created the <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> at the foundation to work on projects with the winners of the foundation's annual human rights awards `` It is a way,'' she said, `` of carrying forth the ideals of the winners and the ways that they shared my father's vision,'' which she described as one of `` love and compassion and justice.'' The center sent a delegation to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> earlier this year to meet with human rights leaders and government officials. Among other planned projects are a series of medical clinics in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` My father believed in action,'' <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said. She's leaving her position as treasurer of her brother's campaign to <PERSON> Courtney </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhe </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> with her husband of eight years, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhe </PERSON> Not all of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s children have entered public service, and some have been crushed by tragedy. The slaying of <LOCATION> RFK </LOCATION> `` totally devastated the family,'' but struck at the oldest boys the hardest, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>, co-author of `` The Kennedys: An American Drama.'' In April 1984, an overdose of painkillers, tranquilizers and cocaine killed <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who some say was alone in a hotel room watching news reports the night his father was gunned down June 5, 1968. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> pleaded guilty to heroin possession in 1983, received a two-year suspended sentence and spent time in a drug-treatment center. Today, he is an environmental law attorney in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and is teaching at <ORGANIZATION> Pace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and his wife of six years, <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, also a lawyer, have two children. A foundation spokeswoman said he was not granting interviews. Some of the clan were just infants or pre-schoolers when their father was killed. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> worked on his brother's campaign. The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> graduate last year married <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Berner </PERSON> and is working at the family-owned Merchandise Mart in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> is about to graduate from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> as a history major. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who has completed his sophomore year at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, has been involved in homeless issues, working with activist <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rory </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> freshman who was born six months after the assassination, has worked with <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> on the human rights center.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy grew at a surprisingly rapid annual rate of 3.9 percent from January through March, much better than previously believed, the government said. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that the gross national product, the broadest measure of economic health, was propelled during the first three months of the year by an export surge, a rebound in car sales and a boom in business capital investment. The report represented a sharp upward revision from an initial estimate made a month ago that the GNP grew at a more modest 2.3 percent rate in the first quarter.

 The number of people losing their jobs to mass layoffs or plant closings appears to have declined sharply last year, but one in four of them still exhausted their unemployment benefits before finding new work, the government reported.

 Oil futures prices advanced on technical market factors in what analysts said was the heaviest trading volume in recent weeks. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Thursday, contracts for July delivery of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, rose 17 cents to close at $ 17.54 per 42-gallon barrel. Among refined products for June delivery, wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 0.63 cent to settle at 52.35 cents a gallon, while wholesale heating oil closed at 48.19 cents a gallon, up 0.88 cent. `` It was the biggest volume we've had in the energy market for several weeks, if not longer,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, an assistant director at <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>.

Seasonal buying of gasoline partly explained the rise in unleaded gas prices. Heavier purchases are typical ahead of the summer driving season, which runs from Memorial Day to Labor Day. `` We always see the best gas demand in summer,'' <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON> noted.

 Porsche placed first in an annual survey naming the 10 most trouble-free cars, while three <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> models made the list, two of them for the first time. The J.D. <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> car quality survey was mailed to 75,000 owners of new 1988 model cars purchased in November and December and asked for the number of problems experienced during the first 90 days. The survey results were announced Thursday. More than 30,000 owners answered the 1988 survey, said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, senior project director for the <LOCATION> Agoura </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, consulting firm. The results: Porsche topped the list of most trouble-free cars with 111 problems reported per 100 cars. Porsche cars came in sixth in 1987. Bumped to the second spot by <ORGANIZATION> Porsche </ORGANIZATION> was <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION>, a fellow West German automaker whose owners reported 115 problems per 100 cars in 1988, up from 108 in 1987, when it placed first. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> tied for third place with 122 problems per 100 cars, an improvement for both. In 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> was third with 125 problems and <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> was fourth with 129. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>'s upscale Acura line slipped to fifth in 1988 from second in 1987. Owners reported 138 problems per 100 cars in 1988, up from 117 in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Daihatsu </ORGANIZATION>, which ranked as the sixth most trouble-free car, barely made it into the 1988 survey, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said, because the company began selling cars in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in December. <ORGANIZATION> Daihatsu </ORGANIZATION> owners reported 141 problems per 100 cars. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s Cadillac, with 143 problems per 100 cars was seventh, while <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION>, with 153, was eighth and Oldsmobile, with 157, placed ninth. <PERSON> Cadillac </PERSON> and <PERSON> Oldsmobile </PERSON> made the list for the first time since J.D. Powers began the survey in 1985. No American models made the list in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>'s other lines fell to No. 10, with 158 problems per 100 cars compared to the 130 problems that put the company in fifth place in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Subaru </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> BMW </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION>, which ranked seventh through 10th in 1987, did not make the list this year. <PERSON> J.D </PERSON>. Powers reports only the top 10 rankings, and in 1987, it announced the number of trouble reports for only the top five cars. `` We discovered there is a relationship between customer satisfaction and the problems that owners experience,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. He said results of the short-term car quality survey have been mirrored in the J.D. Power Customer Satisfaction Index, a rating of dealers produced by surveying owners 12 months after their purchase. The CSI is important to auto dealers because auto manufacturers use it to determine which dealers receive hot new models, new car lines or even new brands. Dealers have complained that the <ORGANIZATION> CSI </ORGANIZATION> reflects problems with vehicles more than problems with dealers, making dealers suffer for manufacturers mistakes. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said both dealer and vehicle quality play in the CSI ratings. `` The more problems, the more pressure on the dealer to fix the car,'' he said, adding that previous survey shows about 50 percent of the problems customers bring back to dealerships are repaired.

 <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> remains `` a few more quarters'' of operating profitability away from restoring the dividend the beleaguered banking giant dropped in 1985, its chairman said. But A.W. <PERSON> Clausen </PERSON> painted an upbeat picture of prospects for the nation's third-largest bank holding company at <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION>'s annual shareholders meeting Thursday. `` <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> is on the road to recovery,'' <PERSON> Clausen </PERSON> said at a news conference preceding the meeting. `` Our turnaround was grounded on a realistic plan to focus on core objectives, to improve the performance of the credit portfolio, and to bring our expenses and revenues into profitable alignment,'' he said. As proof of the recovery, <PERSON> Clausen </PERSON> pointed to a 62 percent increase in first-quarter 1988 profit, decreases in net credit losses over the past six quarters, and reduced expenses from operations and the sale of nonstrategic businesses. <PERSON> Clausen </PERSON> also noted reductions in core business expenses, such as personnel, and increases in net interest income during 1987 and strengthening of the bank's primary capital ratio over the past six quarters. `` Our challenge is to improve fundamental net income on a quarter-by-quarter basis, to bring in each quarter's fundamental earnings at a higher level than the previous quarter, and to extend the recent track record of solid and continuous profitability,'' he said. <PERSON> Clausen </PERSON>, a former head of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> who returned as chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> in late 1986, drew a salary of $ 775,000 last year. <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> stock closed 12.5 cents higher at $ 10.375 a share in composite trading Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. In 1987, <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> reported a net loss of $ 955 million, which followed a 1986 loss of $ 518 million. The company recorded a profit for the first time in six quarters in the third period of 1987, posting net income of $ 54 million. For the first quarter of 1988, the company reported net income of $ 109 million, or 56 cents a share, up from a profit of $ 67 million, or 34 cents a share, a year earlier. The company reported higher earnings for the third straight quarter.

<HEAD>Cable Study Says Industry A Rising Star</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The cable television industry will contribute about $ 32 billion to the gross national product during 1988 and provide some 490,000 jobs, a report commissioned by a cable-related company says. The study was done by <PERSON> Browne </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Bortz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Coddington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> research firm, after being commissioned by <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Daniels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, a major cable TV financial services company based in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. The study updated a 1986 report prepared by the same company which also was sponsored by <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>. The cable industry in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has continued to grow rapidly over the past two years with annual revenue now around $ 12.8 billion, a 24.3 percent increase since 1986, the report said. The industry provides 87,600 direct jobs, and cable-related work provides an additional 60,000 jobs. Another 340,000 jobs are created indirectly, according to he report. Cable-related employment expanded at a lower rate than either economic output or employee income during that time, and the report concluded that `` economic output per employee increased over the past two years, resulting in fewer employees per dollar of economic output.'' The study said cable came of age during the late 1980s with half of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> households now subscribing to cable service; 75 percent of the subscribers now have access to 30 or more program channels; 15 percent have access to 54 or more. Cable-originated programming makes up almost 40 percent of viewing in the average cable home, the report said, while viewing of network-affiliated broadcast stations dropped 12 percent in the past five years. `` Our country is in the midst of a communications revolution,'' <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said. `` During this decade, all media and communications industries grew rapidly, but cable television has been the star performer.'' The study said that in revenue terms, cable television ranks ahead of motion picture box office, radio, home video and broadcast network advertising.

 In an unprecedented move, federal regulators ordered the makers of the anti-acne medicine Accutane to warn customers of potential birth defects by using a picture of a deformed baby on the drug's packaging. `` It is an attempt to emphasize to people that we're not talking about a remote risk of some minor birth defect ... but a very high risk of extremely severe birth defects that can, in effect, make the child unable to function,'' says <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adminstration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigg </PERSON>. Among other requirements, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> will force female patients to sign a consent form stating they understand the risks associated with the powerful drug, according to <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glynn </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the drug's manufacturer, <PERSON> Hoffman-La </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nutley </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Grigg </PERSON> says the requirements were prompted by 62 reported cases of birth defects caused by the drug since it was introduced in 1982, though the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> believes the actual number is much higher. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> says the risk of a pregnant Accutane user having a deformed child is one in four or greater. The requirements follow a recommendation by an <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> advisory panel of outside experts that the prescription drug remain on the market. It is considered the only effective treatment for severe, scarring acne. <PERSON> Grigg </PERSON> said the requirement that <PERSON> Hoffman-La </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> include a photograph of an infant deformed by the drug was `` unprecedented.'' Ms. <PERSON> Glynn </PERSON> said the company basically agrees with the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s order, which does not stray much from the advisory panel's recommendations, but <PERSON> Hoffman-La </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> believes the photo `` may be more appropriate ... to use on the patient consent materials'' signed in the doctor's `` It's not an issue of using the picture, it's where you use the picture,'' she said. The spokeswoman said <PERSON> Hoffman-La </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> received the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s requirements Wednesday in a letter dated May 19 The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> left it to <PERSON> Hoffman-La </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> to release the order or keep it confidential, she said. The company released the letter Thursday. <PERSON> Grigg </PERSON> said Thursday that `` there's still some negotiating room'' if <PERSON> Hoffman-La </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> seeks to alter some of the requirements. The advisory panel and the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> embraced a proposal by <PERSON> Hoffman-La </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> to sell Accutane only in a package in which explicit patient warnings _ including a sketch of a pregnant woman with a red X through it _ would be sealed under clear plastic at the factory to make sure the patient would see them. Ms. <PERSON> Glynn </PERSON> said the company, which must respond to the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s letter within 15 days, hopes to have the patient consent kit on the market by late June, and have the so-called blister packaging in drug stores no later than September The company also will pay the costs of birth control counseling and pregnancy tests for women who use the drug, she said. Since its introduction, Accutane has carried specific and explicit warnings about the high risk that it will cause birth defects if taken during pregnancy. Those warnings were strengthened in recent years, but the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> grew concerned that too many women, and perhaps doctors, were ignoring them. Most of the 62 birth defects reported to the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> _ including disfiguring facial deformitites, severe mental retardation and heart defects _ occurred in the first two years of the medicine's use, when the warnings were less severe Many of the children died within a year of birth, <PERSON> Grigg </PERSON> said. Though the advisory panel concluded the benefits of Accutane outweighed its risks, some government and health experts called for a total ban on the drug.

 A proposed treaty that would remove most tariff barriers between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> probably would increase trade between the two countries but leave some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industries at a competitive disadvantage, a private study says. The study by the <ORGANIZATION> Northeast-Midwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a research group established by members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, found that `` the impact of the proposed agreement likely would be uneven, with some industries gaining and others losing.'' The report, released Thursday, said that the automotive and textile industries would be the big losers under the treaty, now being considered by committees in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. In both the automobile and textile industries, Canadian tariffs would be retained during a phase-out period stretching up to 10 years, making it harder for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industries to compete, the study said. The treaty also would allow <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to establish new barriers in the textile sector, the study noted. On the other hand, the study said, industrial machinery, electronics and energy-intensive industries in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would benefit from the agreement, in part because of already low Canadian tariffs or more rapid removal of duties under the treaty. `` The stakes are high for Northeastern and <LOCATION> Midwestern </LOCATION> states, where about 72 percent of total trade between the two countries occurs,'' the study said. About half the 2 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jobs that are dependent upon exports to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> are located within 12 states, nine of them in the <LOCATION> Northeast-Midwest </LOCATION> region, the study said. In 1986, Canadian exports to the region totaled $ 49 billion, which was about 72 percent of all Canadian shipments to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the study said. The region exported $ 33 billion in goods and services to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, representing about 73 percent of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shipments to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The study found that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> states would benefit from improved access to cheap Canadian hydroelectric power and a better chance to compete in the service sector. The <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> states, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in particular, would benefit from lower prices for Canadian raw materials, but would be hurt by the continuation of Canadian restrictive technical standards for telecommunications equipment, the study said. The <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> in particular, would be hurt by continued barriers that give <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> a competitive edge in the automotive industry, the study said. However, lower raw material costs would increase the manufacturers' `` ability to be price competitive in world markets,'' the study said. The <ORGANIZATION> Northeast-Midwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> serves senators and representatives of 18 states: <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>.

The contract covers about 700 editorial and other employees of <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> said. Negotiations toward a new contract had been carried out over the course of a year. The old contract expired in April 1987. The company declared an impasse in the talks on Nov. 1, 1987, and imposed the terms of its own contract proposal, <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said.

 Dissidents are suing the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union over its acceptance of a new nationwide contract with the trucking industry despite rejection of the accord by 63.5 percent of voting affected members. Teamsters for a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, a Detroit-based dissident faction with ties to consumer advocate <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, filed suit Thursday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> here seeking to nullify the ratification vote earlier this month and prevent the new labor contract from going into effect. The suit claims a 1961 provision in the union's constitution requiring a two-thirds vote for authorizing a strike was illegally interpreted as negating the need for a `` yes'' majority to accept the new three-year accord. `` This conclusion of the <ORGANIZATION> IBT </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- that one-third of the involved members may approve a contract and compel their fellow workers to be bound by it is a plain violation of the <ORGANIZATION> IBT </ORGANIZATION> constitution,'' the suit said. Even if such an interpretation were valid, it added, the union illegally `` attempted to obtain ratification by gerrymandering the electorate to deny the franchise to many members covered by the agreement while giving ballots to many other members not covered ... and refusing to count many ballots.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> announced a week ago that it was accepting the new National Master Freight Agreement covering some 200,000 workers nationwide even though the ratification vote was 64,101 to 36,782 against it. It was the first time in the union's history that a majority of voting rank-and-file drivers and warehouse workers covered by the agreement had rejected a contract negotiated by Teamster leaders. `` Since the constitution requires that the final offer be accepted as a result of failure to reject by two-thirds vote, any strike or work stoppage will be a violation of the agreement and have serious consequences,'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Yager </PERSON>, the chairman of the union's negotiation committee, said in a statement. <PERSON> Yager </PERSON> said 57 percent of the ballots mailed out were not returned, indicating those members were satisfied with the offer. `` If not, they would have cast ballots rejecting the contract,'' he said. However, he and other Teamster officials have acknowledged the widespread dissension over the accord and are seeking to reopen talks with the industry's chief bargaining arm, <ORGANIZATION> Trucking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. According to leaders of the dissident faction and other local Teamster leaders, the opposed provisions include measures requiring drivers to pay for excess insurance premiums based on their accident records and damaged freight or equipment if gross negligence is proved. Widespread rank-and-file opposition also was voiced to a measure in which workers would be required to give up 15 percent of their pay if 75 percent of the affected employees of a losing company approved the concession. <PERSON> Chip </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, a spokesman for the union, said no officials were available to comment on the suit, which was filed late Thursday afternoon. The new contract provides annual 35-cent-an-hour wage gains over the next three years, raising the current base rate for truck drivers from $ 14.71 an hour to $ 15.06 an hour retroactive to April 1.

<HEAD>Modifications Proposed For Older Boeing 737s</HEAD>

 The government is proposing modifications to older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s to help the aging aircraft stand up against the corrosion and crack problems discovered after the breakup of an <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet last month. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday issued two proposed `` airworthiness directives'' designed to serve as long-term solutions to the structural problems identified after a 20-foot section of the Aloha plane tore away during flight on April 28. While some ongoing intensified inspections would be required under the proposed rules, airlines could avoid even more intensive and costly inspections once they completed the modifications. `` We're giving the airlines what we call a ` terminating action,' something they can do so they do n't have to continue to do these very expensive, repetitive inspections,'' <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said of the proposed modifications. The rules cover, in varying degrees, the first 464 of the 737s built, but only an estimated 100 of those aircraft now are being operated by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines. The repairs were expected to take about 2,000 work hours per plane, with the total cost for work on the 100 planes operated by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers estimated at $ 8 million. `` This proposal is prompted by reports of numerous cracks found during inspections of airplanes that have accumulated more than 40,000 landings,'' one of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> proposals states. `` This condition, if not corrected, could result in rapid decompression of the airplane.'' The Aloha jetliner was 19 years old and had made nearly 89,000 landings. The proposed modifications would involve using rivets rather than bonding agents to attach metal tear strips that join pieces of the fuselage. They also would require the replacement of certain countersunk rivets with larger rivets that have protruding heads. The heads of countersunk rivets are set at or below the surface into which they are driven. The countersunk rivets are suspected of having caused small cracks in the skin of the plane that could grow and eventually join into one large crack, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> reported on Tuesday that a special inspection of 96 older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s had revealed small cracks in one of every nine aircraft but not of a magnitude to cause alarm. The inspection is ongoing. <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said the new rules were `` aimed at stopping the cause of the cracks in the first place.'' `` We're fairly certain that most of the cracks that we're concerned with came from the fact that there were countersunk rivets,'' he said The proposed rules are subject to public comment until July 24.

<HEAD>Guild Members Vote On Independent Contracts With 64 Companies</HEAD>

 At least 64 production companies signed independent contracts with the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> as union members, claiming they had split management ranks, gathered to decide whether to accept the agreements. Six more producer requests for contracts were turned in to union officials by Thursday night, when approximately 1,500 guild writers met at the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paladium </LOCATION> to cast their votes. East Coast members of the guild cast ballots Thursday night in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The results of the voting were to be announced this afternoon, union spokeswoman <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said here. The 9,000-member guild claimed the contracts effectively split management ranks among the makers of such hit productions as `` The Cosby Show'' and `` The Tonight Show.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION>, representing the industry's biggest producers, downplayed the defections, which represent the first significant break in the 12-week strike that has forced delays in the start of the fall TV season. `` We're anticipating ratification,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said before the meeting. `` We see it strategically as a good move at this time to break the logjam with the alliance.'' Meanwhile, negotiators for both the alliance and the guild agreed to meet in small groups Saturday and in aother full-dress bargaining session Tuesday. Among the terms in the three-year independent contracts are a 35 percent formula for foreign residuals and greater creative input, two of the major points of contention with the alliance since the March 7 walkout. The alliance is offering 10.3 percent for foreign residuals, said spokesman <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. Residuals are the fees paid to writers when TV shows are rerun or movies reissued. The list of 64 production companies released at the meeting includes the <ORGANIZATION> Carsey-Werner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, which produces two of the most popular shows on television, `` The Cosby Show'' and its spinoff, `` A Different World.'' The makers of `` The Tonight Show'' signed a contract and the producers of `` Late Night with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'' have agreed to a contract but have n't signed, said union President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirgo </PERSON>. Among the others to sign were producers of `` <PERSON> Alf </PERSON>,'' `` The Muppets'' and `` Highway to Heaven.'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said none of the 217 major producers that belong to the alliance has signed independent contracts. Large producers, whose ranks include <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> MTM </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON>, employ 80 percent of the industry's writers and supply 84 percent of prime-time TV shows, he said. `` The alliance producers are holding strong,'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said. `` Our objective is to get this town back to work and get everybody working.'' He estimated that the independent deals would only re-employ about 72 writers. `` If they're satisfied to put 72 writers to work and leave 4,000 out of work, that's their choice,'' he said. `` They have no way to estimate that number,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> responded. `` They just pulled that out of thin air the way they do with all of their other figures.''

 Agricultural researchers are doing their own production of `` Roots'' by inserting a tiny video camera into the soil to record the underground development of soybean plants. The technique could help scientists understand how various tillage systems affect crop growth, as well as when and where to apply fertilizer and pesticide. `` I think it will work and it will be an important tool,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Levan </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> researcher who worked on the project with <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> engineers <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hummel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Sudduth </PERSON>. The 1 - by 3-inch video camera is guided down clear plastic tubes inserted in the bean rows and used to record root growth from a few inches to more than 3 feet below the surface `` It's not very spectacular as movies go, I'm afraid,'' said <PERSON> Hummel </PERSON>, scanning one tape. Depth markers can be read on the inside of the tube, and white soybean roots can be seen in the earth. Occasionally, an insect moves into the frame to nibble on a root. `` I saw a soybean beetle,'' said <PERSON> Levan </PERSON>. `` The root was very prominent _ new, large and white _ and there was the worm chewing through it. It was real clear.'' The tubes are inserted in the ground at an angle soon after planting so the soybean crop can be checked throughout the season. In two previous seasons, the focus has been on perfecting the technique. Without the video equipment, scientists must remove cores of soil, section them, wash off the dirt and measure roots, <PERSON> Levan </PERSON> said. That method does not allow observation of the same roots throughout the season, she said. <PERSON> Hummel </PERSON> said the tiny camera actually was designed to inspect the inside of pipes in nuclear power plants. In the UI study, some soybeans being monitored are planted in undisturbed soil while others are planted after deep, thorough plowing. `` It also should be helpful for fertilizer placement because it tells you where the active roots are during the growing season,'' said <PERSON> Levan </PERSON>. `` Also, you can observe insects that attack roots and see when they hatch and where they feed.'' That might help scientists determine the best time and location for insecticides, and it should help them compare the results of various products by watching them work in the soil, the researchers said.

<HEAD>Four-Month Surplus Shows Increase Over Previous Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s current account surplus rose 41 percent in the first four months of this year from its level of a year earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday. The surplus in January through April was $ 3.89 billion, up from 2.76 billion dollars one year ago. Officials at the central bank said if the present pace continues, the surplus is likely to top $ 10 billion by the end of the year, above the record of $ 9.85 billion dollars last year. The current account, measuring trade in merchandise and services, showed a surplus of $ 880 million in April, down from $ 1.25 billion in March but up from $ 650 million in April last year. The officials said the decline from March was due largely to a slowdown in exports attributed to labor strikes and other factors which affected shipments, particularly of automobiles and toys.

 Major European airlines expect their profits will fall by about 16 percent this year after a dramatic 93 percent jump in earnings in 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> AEA </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 22 major European carriers, predicted the combined net profit of its members would fall to about $ 650 million in 1988 from $ 775 million last year. The airlines' 1987 net profit was up 93 percent over the $ 400 million reported in 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> AEA </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. Gross operating profit for the group was expected to fall to about $ 1.1 billion this year from a record $ 1.29 billion in 1987.

The <ORGANIZATION> AEA </ORGANIZATION> said growth in passenger traffic is expected to slow to about 7 percent this year, from 13 percent in 1987 when traffic rebounded from a disastrous previous year.

 Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, who persuaded a <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> utility to abandon a $ 5.3 billion nuclear plant, still has to sell the deal to Wall Street bankers and a host of federal, state and local officials. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, who announced the tentative agreement on the <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> nuclear plant Thursday, also wants the plant 55 miles east of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> dismantled, but said there may be problems winning approval from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Nuclear Regulatory Commission. `` I expect the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> to do everything it can to kill us and open the plant,'' the governor said. `` I do n't trust the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` We're not going to comment on that,'' <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> said today. If the agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> goes through, it would mark the first time a completed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear plant was abandoned before opening. For <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION>, which was driven to the edge of bankruptcy by the plant, the deal averted a threatened takeover by the state. The accord drew applause from <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> opponents, even though it concedes <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> a rate hike of more than 50 percent over the next decade to pay for the shutdown. `` This makes my whole year!'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Schantz </PERSON>, who lives in the town of <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> with her husband and two children. But it was the latest bad news for the troubled nuclear industry. More than 100 nuclear plants have been canceled since <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> began building <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> in 1973 and no plants have been proposed in the last decade. The pact `` is a bad agreement for the nation as a whole,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, an industry group in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` The agreement could threaten energy security, as well as national security, by increasing oil prices in the face of predicted brownouts in the Northeast this summer.'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said the plant must be torn down to prevent future state leadersfrom resurrecting it. Just mothballing it, he told an <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> news conference, `` would be very much like taking a loaded rifle and storing it in the closet.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hochbrueckner </PERSON>, whose district includes the plant, agreed. `` We've shown Shoreham the cross, but we have to put a stake through its heart,'' he said. However, if the plant were dismantled, the fuel rods would have to be disposed at a nuclear waste facility. There are no facilities for high-level, commercial nuclear waste in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> said earlier this month. The Shoreham project, begun in 1965, ended up 10 years behind schedule and 80 times more expensive than predicted. The plant was completed in 1984 but never opened because state and local officials refused to participate in preparing emergency evacuation plans, arguing that <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> could n't be safely evacuated in a nuclear accident. Lacking such a plan, the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> refused to issue more than a low-power testing license. Under the agreement, <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> would pay to decommission the plant, which <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> aides said could cost $ 500 million, while the state would buy it for a token dollar so that <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> can claim a tax loss. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said some details of the agreement remain to be worked out, but insisted `` we have gotten everything we wanted. ... Shoreham has to die, <PERSON> Shoreham </PERSON> will die.'' To make that happen, the investment community must agree to refinance $ 2 billion worth of <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> debt at lower interest rates. Wall Street's initial reaction was positive. The price of <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> stock jumped nearly 14 percent Thursday, rising $ 1.375 to $ 11.38 in heavy trading. The state <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> must also agree to grant <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> 5 percent rate hikes for the next three years, and set a goal of 5 percent increases a year for the following seven years. <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION>'s nearly 1 million customers already pay the second highest power rates in the country, second only to neighboring <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area. In addition, the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> must give the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> permission to build five non-nuclear generating plants on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> to ensure sufficient power for the area.

<TEXT>
 After-tax incomes fell 0.9 percent in April, the sharpest setback in a year, as tax filings took a big bite out of Americans' disposable income, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it was the first decline in disposable income since a 0.6 percent drop last November and the biggest decrease since a 2.5 percent decline in April 1987, when changes prompted by the new tax law took an even bigger bite out of Americans' incomes. Facing big tax bills, Americans cut back on spending last month as well. Personal consumption spending was basically flat in April following a 0.8 percent rise in March. Before adjusting for taxes, personal income rose a weak 0.1 percent in April following a 1.1 percent jump in March. This performance was substantially below economists' expectations. Many of them had been looking for a gain of around 0.6 percent based on the strong employment increase in April which pushed the jobless rate down to a 14-year low of 5.4 percent. The big decline in disposable incomes pushed Americans' savings rate, savings as a percentage of disposable income, down to 3.8 percent last month, compared to a rate of 4.7 percent in March. The report said personal tax payments climbed at an annual rate of $ 36.2 billion in April, compared to a March increase of $ 10.9 billion. Most of that gain came in payments taxpayers had to make when they filed their returns before the April 15 deadline. Wages and salaries rose at an annual rate of $ 7.9 billion in April, down from a March increase of $ 15 billion, reflecting primarily the fact that wages were boosted in March by a payment of bonuses to workers at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Farm income fell $ 7.6 billion last month compared to an increase of $ 19.4 billion in March, with federal subsidy payments accounting for the wide swing On the spending side, purchases of durable goods fell by $ 4.3 billion while purchases of non-durable goods dropped $ 14.1 billion. Purchases of services, which include housing costs, climbed $ 11.6 billion.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Tax filings took a big chunk from Americans' disposable income last month and compelled them to cut spending substantially, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported today. It said after-tax incomes fell 0.9 percent in April, the sharpest setback in a year and the first decline since a 0.6 percent drop in November. Personal consumption spending was basically stagnant in April following a 0.8 percent rise in March, the department said. In April 1987, changes prompted by the new tax law took a bigger bite out of Americans' incomes and reduced their disposable income by 2.5 percent. Before adjusting for taxes, personal income rose a weak 0.1 percent in April following a 1.1 percent jump in March. This performance was substantially below the expectations of many economists, who have predicted strong economic growth this year. Evidence of that strong growth was reported Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which said the gross national product grew at a surprisingly rapid annual rate of 3.9 percent in the first three months of the year. The growth was much better than anticipated and came largely from surging exports, higher auto sales and increased business capital investment. `` You would have to say that not only was the stock market crash ignored, but the economy thumbed its nose at it,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON>, chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The report reflected a sharp upward revision from an initial estimate made a month ago that the GNP grew at a more modest 2.3 percent rate in the first quarter. It elated Republicans, who are hoping a record 66-month-long expansion since the last recession of 1981-82 will bolster prospects that Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will win the White House in the November election. But to the stock and bond markets, sensitive barometers of the economy's future direction, the GNP report was widely viewed as another signal that higher inflation is inevitable. The inflation signal was substantiated by another government report Thursday showing after-tax corporate profits rose only 0.5 percent in the first quarter. Some economists suggested that meant companies will attempt to boost their profits by raising prices. On Wall Street, stocks gained only marginally Thursday in light trading, reflecting an apathy that has persisted for months. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.38 points to 1,966.75 after falling 1.16 the day before. Bond prices were mostly lower. The key 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond fell \ point or $ 2.50 for every $ 1,000 in face value, and its yield, which moves inversely to its price, climbed to 9.32 percent from 9.28 percent late Wednesday. Many analysts have predicted that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, responsible for restraining inflation, will push interest rates higher to dampen demand for credit. The central bank has tightened credit twice in the past two months. Some said the fast GNP growth was an advance signal of a 1989 recession, despite White House assertions that the number harbored no bad news.

<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures opened higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> today on buying encouraged by forecasts for hot, dry weather in the Midwest through the Memorial Day weekend. The volatile soybean market, which fell Wednesday and Thursday, surged at today's opening, with most contracts up more than 12 cents a bushel. Wheat also posted strong early gains while corn and oats were slightly higher. Although dry weather poses a real threat to the maturing winter wheat crop, the runup in soybean, corn and oat prices is largely speculative since those newly planted crops have not yet developed enough to sustain damage, analysts said. `` I do n't think the crops are under stress but the traders are sure hot,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Freed </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Recent trading patterns indicate soybean prices will continue to advance if the weather stays dry, Freed said. In early trading, wheat was 3 -LCB- cents to 5 \ cents higher with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.40 \ a bushel; corn was 1 -RCB- cents to 2 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 2.15 a bushel; oats were 2 -RCB- cents to 3 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 1.74 a bushel; soybeans were 8 cents to 13 -RCB- cents higher with July at $ 7.66 -LCB- a Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .02 cent lower to .35 cent higher with June at 72.25 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .05 cent higher with August at 76.55 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent to .33 cent higher with June at 53.20 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .20 cent to .75 cent higher with July at 54.15 cents a pound. Livestock and meat futures settled mostly higher on Thursday.

<HEAD>EEC Criticizes U.S. Cuts In Wheat Set-Aside Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> criticized the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Friday for cuts in required wheat set-aside acreage, which will take less land out of production this year than last. `` There seems to be a fairly flagrant contradiction between what the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> claims to do and what it is doing,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> official, who asked not to be named. Both the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are using programs to take land out of production as a way to cut agricultural overproduction. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had adjusted its support levels for wheat farmers by announcing earlier this week that they would have to cut planted acreage by only 10 percent this year in order to qualify for government subsidies. Last year they had been forced to cut acreage by 27.5 percent. Each year at this time the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration announces price supports and acreage requirements for subsidies under various programs. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said it remained determined to continue with its own set-aside programs, calling it unfortunate that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was taking this action so soon before the mid-term review of the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks to be held at the end of this year. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration has called for an end to all agricultural subsidies in both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> by the year 2000. The trade bloc has criticized the goal as unrealistic.

<HEAD>Check Cashing Service Offers The Shirt Off Its Back

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> wants customers to remember his check cashing service as the one that's so good it offers the shirt off his back. Well, actually not his back, but the backs of some of his women clerks. Van is a pioneer of topless check cashing, following in the tradition of <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s famous topless doughnut shop. `` With all the competition we needed something unique,'' said <PERSON> Van </PERSON>, director of operations for Tops Check Cashing. `` What could be more unique than having topless girls?'' For the regular check-cashing fee of up to 10 percent of the check's value, customers can talk to two topless hostesses while waiting for their cash. The women also sell beer, cigarettes, soft drinks and snacks. The check-cashing office, which began the topless service Monday, does n't plan to put up a sign announcing it at the shopping center where the office is located, but <PERSON> Van </PERSON> said he plans to advertise. `` I think it's disgusting,'' said <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasch </PERSON>, manager of a sandwich shop nearby. `` You have many young children in the neighborhood.'' Topless businesses are allowed in unincorporated areas of the county as long as they do not admit minors, said sheriff's spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Crolius </PERSON> In 1985, a topless doughnut shop, R Donuts, opened in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, becoming the first topless business in the county that was n't a bar or nightclub. `` We're still selling a lot of doughnuts,'' its owner, <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Emery </PERSON>, said today.

 <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s board today rejected a $ 60-a-share buyout offer from takeover artist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> and denounced the bid as a pressure tactic. The directors also called on <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> to abandon what they described as his `` costly and disruptive'' proxy contest, in which he is seeking five seats on the oil giant's board. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> launched the proxy battle this morning before the board formally gathered to consider the offer, which values <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> at $ 14.6 billion. Spokesman <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Call </PERSON> said <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> did not want to waste time and decided to mail ballots for his slate of candidates before the long Memorial Day weekend began. In rejecting the offer, the <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> board cited a number of factors they claimed undermined the seriousness of the bid. They echoed management's sentiments in questioning whether <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> could arrange financing and said the 48-hour deadline he imposed on the offer indicated he was not serious. The board said it was confident <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s restructuring program would enhance shareholder value. Analysts were skeptical that <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s board would approve <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s offer. `` I would be flabbergasted if <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s board agreed to <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s merger proposal,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, who follows <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co He joined others in suggesting that the offer was doomed from the beginning and that <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s largest shareholder, was fully aware of that. Wall Street remained unenthusiastic. Shares in the nation's third largest oil company eased 50 cents to $ 49.50 a share in afternoon trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> battled it out in competing full-page ads in selected newspapers today _ with <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> asking shareholders if they can trust the company's future to <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, and the takeover strategist urging them to take up his offer. Analysts suggested <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s real intention in making the bid was to push <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price up as he continued his war of nerves against the management of the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, N.Y.-based company. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s offer of $ 60 for each of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s 243 million shares would value the company at $ 14.6 billion. However, under the offer, he would have to pay out only $ 12.4 billion for the 207 million shares he does not already own. He paid an average $ 34 a share, or about $ 1.22 billion, for his existing stake of 36 million shares. The combined total of $ 13.64 billion would amount to the biggest sum ever paid in a corporate buyout. The previous record was a $ 13.4 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, now <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, in 1984. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON>, in a statement released Thursday, reiterated his claim that <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s offer was bogus. `` There is no basis to believe that Mr. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> can arrange the financing for a transaction of approximately $ 20 billion _ including the purchase of the shares he does n't own ... and the payment of debt and other obligations that would have to be satisified in connection with his proposal,'' <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON> said. When making the offer on Wednesday, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> said he was so sure he could obtain financing that he would place $ 100 million in escrow and forfeit it to <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> if he failed to get commitments before the company's annual shareholders meeting next month _ subject to certain conditions. The struggle has been escalating since last fall when <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> began building what has become a 14.8 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>. Today, that stake is so large that he can not sell it quickly _ and collect his profit _ without depressing its price on the market. `` I think he wants somebody to bail him out,'' said <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Haigler </PERSON>, an analyst at the securities firm <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weil </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labouisse </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friedrichs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> revealed Thursday that <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> recently found a buyer willing to pay $ 50 a share for his stake in the oil company, but he rejected the offer because it `` smacked of greenmail.'' <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Maneri </PERSON> said the claim `` is totally untrue and Mr. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> knows it.'' Furthermore, <PERSON> Maneri </PERSON> said that if a $ 50-a-share offer had surfaced, `` every indication we have is that <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> would have run through a brick wall to accept it.'' In recent months, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has been pressuring <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s management to take steps to raise the value of the company's stock, if necessary by breaking it up and selling off the pieces. He has backed up the demand by launching a proxy fight to install himself and four allies on <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s 14-seat board. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, which emerged last month from a year under bankruptcy court protection, responded by restoring its $ 3 annual dividend and expanding its planned asset sales to $ 5 billion from $ 3 billion. Wednesday afternoon, company officials broke off three weeks of peace talks, claiming <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> was making unreasonable demands for special treatment in the financial restructuring. An <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> spokesman strongly denied the charge. A few hours later, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> released a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> containing his offer. He also said he would drop his threatened proxy contest if management would allow the other 211,000 stockholders to consider the offer at the company's annual meeting next month.

<TEXT>
 Prices on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> settled slightly lower Friday as the market largely ignored worse-than-expected British trade figures and chose instead to focus on the long holiday weekend. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index closed 1.6 points, or 0.09 percent, lower at 1,783.7. Volume totaled a slim 346.5 million shares, compared with Thursday's 435.8 million. Analysts said volume was low on account of the British bank holiday on Monday. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s merchandise trade deficit widened to 1.125 billion pounds, or $ 2.09 billion, in April, and its current account deficit widened to 525 million pounds, the government said. Average market forecasts were for a April trade deficit of around 1 billion pounds and a current account deficit of 400 million pounds. The current account includes `` invisible trade'' including financial transactions. But several analysts said the trade information was not critical to the equity market. `` There was a little bit of a quiver after the trade figures but then the market took it completely in stride,'' said one analyst. Dealers said the only feature in an otherwise quiet, pre-holiday market were food issues, buoyed by the competing bids for <ORGANIZATION> Rowntree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> from the two Swiss food giants <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Jacobs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suchard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>.

 Two exchanges that trade stock-index futures said Friday they oppose the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s bid to take over regulation of trading in the contracts. `` It's a grasp for power and it was certainly not a unanimous opinion by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> board,'' said <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Yemma </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is not a new agenda and it predates the stock market crash.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> voted 3-2 in favor of taking over the regulation of stock index futures from its sister agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The shift in jurisdiction must be approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said studies since the Oct. 19 stock market collapse point to a need for one agency to oversee the trading of stocks and stock-related products. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, where most stock-index futures are traded, officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, which also offers stock-index futures contracts, quickly denounced the move and vowed to fight it. Stock-index futures also are traded by the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. `` We would strongly disagree with that,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> vote. `` We feel that these markets should be regulated as they are by the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>, who during the week of Oct. 19 performed flawlessly in their duties,'' he said. <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yemma </PERSON> contended that all trading in futures contracts _ whether they be a financial product like stock-indexes or an agricultural product like soybeans _ should be regulated by the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>. `` Even though the underlying product emanates from the stock exchange, these are still futures contracts and we believe, just as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> mandated, they should be regulated by the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Yemma </PERSON>, who said the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 Index makes up 75 percent of the market in stock-index futures trading, echoed those sentiments. `` The <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> is best equipped to regulate futures markets,'' he said. `` Stock index futures are one product in a vast array of financial and agricultural futures which we offer and the other exchanges offer.'' `` If you take stock index futures and move them to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> where they would become simply one of many things the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> oversees, we do n't feel there's the expertise there to oversee them correctly,'' <PERSON> Yemma </PERSON> said. He also said recent reports examining the causes of the stock crash have criticized the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s regulatory work, but have not faulted the futures commission's job. `` There have been efforts by certain members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and certain members of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> to move regulation of stock index futures to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> for years,'' <PERSON> Yemma </PERSON> said. `` It's basically politics and turf.''

 Stock prices slumped today under the weight of rising interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 16.71 to 1,950.04 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 3 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 566 up, 832 down and 469 unchanged. After rising sharply on Thursday, interest rates moved up again in the credit markets today.

 <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LP </ORGANIZATION>, waging a hostile $ 2.2 billion takeover bid for <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, lost a proxy battle for six seats on the company's board, <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> said Friday in announcing official results of the vote. But the <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, Texas-based investors group said it was pressing ahead with its takeover attempt and had extended its $ 42-a-share tender offer for 39 million shares until next Friday, June 3, at 7 p.m. EDT. USG released the official results of the contest for six seats on its board, showing the USG-backed slate. The results were announced to stockholders Friday at a continuation of <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting, which was originally convened May 11. <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> said its nominees for the board received 56 percent of the vote, while Desert Partner's opposition slate of candidates won 41 percent. Three percent of the vote was withheld, according to the tally completed by <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. When <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> announced the preliminary results Sunday, showing its directors had won, officials for <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> vowed to continue their takeover fight. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Spar </PERSON>, a spokesman for the partnership, reiterated those plans Friday. Besides extending its tender offer, he said <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> still was proposing to acquire USG through negotiations in a plan that calls for giving stockholders a combination of cash, debentures and stocks that have been valued at $ 50 a share. USG primarily manufactures building materials for the construction industry.

<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> asked the federal government Friday to delay oil and gas drilling off <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s southwest coast and the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> wrote a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> asking for more time to study potential environmental damage from any oil spills before any exploratory drilling is allowed. The governor also said he would reject requests for permits to drill in areas leased by the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 and 1985 if such activities threaten the Keys or <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` It is critical that we have a detailed understanding of the currents in the eastern Gulf -LRB- of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> -RRB- and <LOCATION> Straits </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to ensure the protection of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION>, home of the nation's only living coral reef and countless other irreplaceable resources,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> wrote The only permit request the governor has received so far is from <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, which wants to drill as many as 23 test wells north of the Dry Tortugas, which are west of <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor also wrote a separate letter to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s congressional delegation, vowing to continue discussing the state's opposition to offshore drilling with officials in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. He assured them he would take whatever actions are necessary to protect the Keys and other sensitive coastal areas. The letters dealt with an area south of <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> to just north of the Dry Tortugas, <LOCATION> Marquesas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION>, which was not included in a recent agreement by <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> to drop leasing plans for 11 million acres off <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s coasts. It is an area of 73 lease blocks for which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ordered a three-year study before any drilling could be conducted. A panel of 30 scientists assembled by <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> concluded that the federal environmental research was inadequate and more would be needed before potential detrimental impacts of such drilling on <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s environment and economy could be fully determined. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did not require any evaluation of the research results before drilling could be permitted. Eighteen of the 19 members of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s congressional delegation have signed a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> urging that a rider be attached to the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s appropriation to prohbit the expenditure of any money for leasing or drilling off <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s southwest coast, Ms. <PERSON> Whitfield </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Tampa </LOCATION>, declined to sign. The governor is concerned about what path an oil spill might take near the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION> and the impact it might have on the coral reef, mangroves and other natural resources. His panel of scientists reported that existing studies lack information on where prevailing currents might carry an oil spill in the eastern <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and Straits of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> also cited the failure of the federal studies to address all potential environmental and economic effects on nearshore and coastal resources.

<TEXT>
 The 6th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> refused Friday to block a $ 197 million takeover bid for <ORGANIZATION> Murray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. A three-judge panel said <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION> should not be penalized, as <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> asked, because it had been represented by a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law firm that once helped advise <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> on how to fight a takeover. The judges agreed that the law firm, <ORGANIZATION> Sullivan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Cromwell </PERSON>, had a conflict of interest, but they noted earlier testimony that no confidential information from <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> was passed on to <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION> officials learned of the potential conflict of interest April 28 and switched to another adviser, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the following day The appeals judges upheld a decision Monday by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON>, who said he knew of `` no law permitting the court to enjoin the transfer of stock.'' Immediately after <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> ruled, <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION> increased its tender offer from $ 48 per share, or $ 182 million, to $ 52 per share, or $ 197 million. <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> stock rose 75 cents on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Friday to close at $ 60.75 per share, indicating Wall Street expects an even higher offer. <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> officials have asked shareholders not to accept the tender offer until they have reviewed it. Management promised a recommendation by June 7, two weeks before the offer was scheduled to expire. Two other lawsuits over the <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION> bid are pending. One, in <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lawrenceburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, challenges the legality of <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>'s plan to increase its outstanding stock by 50 percent _ a `` poison pill'' defense designed to make the cost of a takeover prohibitive. Another lawsuit, in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, was filed by <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION> to challenge <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>'s arguments that an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> state law against hostile takeovers does not apply to <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Murray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> was incorporated in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> in 1919 as an auto parts manufacturer but moved its headquarters to suburban <LOCATION> Brentwood </LOCATION> in 1955. <LOCATION> Murray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> manufactures lawn mowers and bicycles at <LOCATION> Lawrenceburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION>, which has no connection with vacuum cleaner manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Marietta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, operates a Tappan range plant at <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>

 <ORGANIZATION> Redken </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, which manufactures hypo-allergenic hair and skin products, will convert from public to private ownership, chief executive officer <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON> announced. Mrs. <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON>, 57, a former actress who founded the firm in as an answer to her own allergy to hair spray, said Thursday she plans a tender offer of $ 34 per share for the roughly 1.4 million shares she does not already own. `` I found it very difficult being a public company,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON>, whose husband <PERSON> John </PERSON> is chairman and president of the company. `` What happens is there is a great deal of short-term thinking that the analysts and financial community want you to do,'' she said. `` I think we did start to run our company based on quarters rather than good planning. The Meehans control about 48 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Redken </ORGANIZATION> stock. There are 2.74 million shares outstanding. <ORGANIZATION> Redken </ORGANIZATION> stock closed at $ 34 a share in over-the-counter trading Friday. Mrs. <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON> said there is no possibility of a bidding war that would increase the price of the offer, but she and her husband refuse to sell their current stock to another party or engage in a merger. Redken products are sold through beauty salons. She co-founded the company in 1960 with $ 3,000. Her partner at that time, chemist <PERSON> Jheri </PERSON> <PERSON> Redding </PERSON>, sold his interest a short time later.

 British industrialist <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> faced a new barrier against their $ 1.7-billion hostile bid for <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> when a federal judge in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on Friday summoned them to a contempt of court hearing June 6. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> filed papers Thursday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> accusing <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> of violating the court's order not to proceed with their $ 60-per-share tender offer. Echoing allegations lodged previously in federal court here, <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> complained that its suitors have continued to advertise for shareholder support and extend their tender offer's expiration date. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cessar </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Chief Judge <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Real </PERSON> filed the order Friday in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The Pittsburgh-based construction materials and chemicals company previously won federal injunctions in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> blocking the tender offer on considerations of securities laws and anti-trust laws respectively. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Chief Judge <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohill </PERSON> previously scheduled a June 6 hearing in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> to consider alleged violations of securities laws by <ORGANIZATION> BNS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the group headed by <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> has charged BNS with violating margin lending laws by offering preferred stock to <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> in return for a $ 540 million loan. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>'s company, <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, said it was asking its shareholders to authorize a guarantee for the loan. <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> said it would issue the loan guarantee only if in closing the deal it did not have a merger agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> or it had less than 90 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' common and preferred shares. The latest extension of the <ORGANIZATION> BNS </ORGANIZATION> offer was to expire at midnight Friday. BNS said that as of Wednesday, 19.74 million common shares had been tendered and not withdrawn and that counting shares it already owns it could claim 77.6 percent of the shares outstanding. BNS also said nearly 107,600 preferred shares, or 71.7 percent of those outstanding, have been tendered.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Finish Week On A High Note</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Soybean futures prices posted strong gains Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in anticipation of a dry Memorial Day weekend. Grain futures advanced slightly. On other markets, gold and silver retreated; livestock and meat futures were mixed; energy futures were mixed; and stock-index futures declined. Soybeans also were supported by indications the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had purchased soybean meal from both <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, analysts said. But weather concerns dominated the soybean and grain markets as they have throughout the unusually dry spring planting period. The nation's soybean stockpiles are declining and fears of tight supplies have pushed soybean futures prices to their highest levels in four years. Soybean prices declined on Wednesday and Thursday when rain entered the weekend weather forecasts. But Friday, most forecasters were calling for only scattered showers across the northern Plains and upper <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and dry conditions in the rest of the Corn Belt. `` The markets got hammered pretty good on Wednesday and Thursday,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlin </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` What we've pretty much done is moved to a level midway between Thursday's lows and Tuesday's highs.'' Soybean prices probably will open sharply higher Tuesday if the long weekend is as hot and dry as expected, analysts said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> issued a six-to-10-day outlook after the close, predicting below-normal rainfall for most of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> for the second half of next week. Wheat settled -LCB- cent lower to 3 \ cents higher with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.39 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 2 -LCB- cents to 7 cents higher with July at $ 2.16 -LCB- a bushel; oats were -RCB- cent to 1 -RCB- cents higher with July at $ 1.72 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 5 cents to 16 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 7.68 a bushel Gold and silver futures declined substantially on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in response to the dollar's gains against other major currencies and on expectations the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> was set to raise its discount interest rate, analysts said. Activity was extremely light as many traders got an early start on the weekend, said <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Raptoploulos </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The metals declined despite the inflationary effect of higher soybean prices, but Ms. <PERSON> Raptopoulos </PERSON> said it was not yet clear whether fears of inflation have finally left the metals markets. `` I would say today, perhaps, the inflationary fears diffused,'' she said. Gold settled $ 2.10 to $ 3.30 lower with June at $ 450.80 a troy ounce; silver was 8.4 cents to 8.5 cents lower with July at $ 6.575 a troy ounce. Cattle futures retreated on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as cash prices fell amid slackening wholesale demand. Retailers have reduced their beef purchases in anticipation of lower demand following the Memorial Day weekend, analysts said. Some traders, eyeing the recent runup in cattle prices, sold on fears of a repeat of the 1978 market, when cattle prices peaked on May 30, then fell 15.2 percent by June 22, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` There's concern we might be in for that same kind of pressure,'' he said. Pork futures advanced in reaction to a slight decrease in slaughters, which many feel is a prelude to a seasonal rise in cash hog prices, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said. Live cattle were .23 cent to .70 cent lower with June at 71.92 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .08 cent to .63 cent lower with August at 76.22 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to .80 cent higher with June at 53.62 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .30 cent to .92 cent higher with July at 54.32 cents a pound. Energy futures finished mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in light trading ahead of the holiday weekend. Crude-oil futures were pressured by reports that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s oil minister, visiting the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said his nation had no intention of reducing oil production, according to <PERSON> Nauman </PERSON> <PERSON> Barakat </PERSON>, vice-president of energy futures trading for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents to 11 cents lower with July at $ 17.43 a barrel; heating oil was .26 cent to .41 cent lower with June at 47.78 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .20 cent lower to .20 cent higher with June at 52.55 cents a gallon Stock-index futures fell on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for June delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 2.10 points lower at 253.50.

 The dollar rose against major foreign currencies Friday as traders decided <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates were likely to rise. Gold prices fell in thin trading. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> said gold bullion was bid at $ 451 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $ 453.10 an ounce late Thursday. Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar was first helped by strong Japanese buying. It gained further when it went above 1.71 West German marks, a level which had been seen as the upper limit of its present exchange rate. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> did not raise the discount rate Friday, as some traders had expected, many continued to believe the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has tightened credit enough so that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks will be prompted to raise their prime rates another notch next week, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON>, a currency analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Expectations of higher <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates tend to boost the dollar by making dollar-denominated investments more attractive. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound traded late in the day at $ 1.8570, down from $ 1.8625 late Thursday. Later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, sterling fell to $ 1.8574 from $ 1.8611. The dollar closed at 124.64 Japanese yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, up from 124.50 late Thursday. In later <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trading, the dollar was quoted at 124.82 yen. At the end of the trading day in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar rose to 124.93 yen from 124.58 late Thursday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.7178 West German marks, up from 1.7086; 1.4358 Swiss francs, up from 1.4233; 1.2392 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2364; 5.7770 French francs, up from 5.7565; and 1,273.13 Italian lire, up from 1,267.75 Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.7140 West German marks, up from 1.7080; 1.4305 Swiss francs, up from 1.4257; 5.7660 French francs, up from 5.7620; 1.9177 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9125; 1,270.75 Italian lire, up from 1,268.00; and 1.2407 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2374 In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold closed at a bid $ 454.12 a troy ounce, up from $ 452.42. The late bid price for gold bullion in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> was $ 452 a troy ounce, down from $ 453.30 late Thursday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold was bid at $ 452.50, down from $ 454. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery was bid at $ 450.80 a troy ounce, down from $ 454.10 late Thursday. Silver bullion traded late in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid $ 6.59 a troy ounce, down from $ 6.63.

<TEXT>
 Bonds recouped some of their early losses Friday to end narrowly mixed. Analysts said trading activity was light, with many participants getting an early jump on the long Memorial Day weekend. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s bellwether 30-year issue, which fell about \ point, or $ 2.50 per $ 1,000 face amount, by midday, closed up 62.5 cents. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price, slipped to 9.31 percent from Thursday's close of 9.32 percent. The bond market started out on a down note amid speculation the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> was tightening its credit policies again to prevent the economy from overheating and inflation from rekindling. But fears of higher interest rates abated somewhat with an easing of the closely watched federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks. It traded at 7 \ percent, down from 7 -RCB- percent late Thursday Fears of <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> tightening stemmed from Thursday's revised report on first-quarter gross national product, which found the economy grew at a brisk 3.9 percent annual rate. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term governments were unchanged to 1-32 point higher, intermediate maturities ranged from unchanged to up 1-32 point and long-term issues were down -LRB- point to up 1-16 point, according to figures provided by <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a business information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Index </ORGANIZATION>, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, fell 0.03 to 108.32. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, stood at 1,133.97, down 0.34. In corporate trading, industrials and utilities were unchanged in light trading, according to the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, fell 0.24 to 275.05 In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds was unchanged at 87 5-32 as of 3 p.m. EDT. The average yield also was unchanged from late Thursday at 8.21 percent. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills were down 1 basis point to 6.43 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bills fell 2 basis points to 6.83 percent and one-year bills were off 7.12 percent.

 The stock market drifted lower Friday in a meandering preholiday session. A late downturn in interest rates, which left bonds mixed on the day, failed to stir much enthusiasm for stocks. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 10.31 to 1,956.44, finishing the week with a net gain of 3.85 points. Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 618 up, 777 down and 506 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> came to 133.59 million shares, down from 164.26 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 151.48 million shares. After rising sharply on Thursday, interest rates moved up again in the credit markets in early trading Friday. Analysts cited a spreading belief that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> was tightening credit further in response to evidence of continuing strength in the economy. On Thursday the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> made a sharp upward revision in its figure for economic growth during the first quarter of the year. As the session passed, bonds attracted some buyers. `` The bond market was comforted by the notion that policymakers are attempting to snuff out inflation fears,'' said analysts as <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. But stocks apparently still suffered from neglect, with many participants getting an early start on the long Memorial Day weekend. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> lost -RRB- to 49 | in active trading The company's directors rejected a $ 60-a-share takeover proposal by financier <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>. Japanese stocks ran into selling following a down day in the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market. <PERSON> Matsushita </PERSON> fell 8 -LCB- to 200; <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> 2 -RRB- to 133 ~, and <ORGANIZATION> Kyocera </ORGANIZATION> 3 ~ to <ORGANIZATION> Duquesne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION>, unchanged at 14 -LCB-, and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Utilities, down -LRB- at 25 |, were the day's most active issues, in trading dominated by strategies focused on the companies' forthcoming dividends Those two stocks, in fact, accounted for nearly one-third of the day's overall volume. <ORGANIZATION> Huffy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> fell 3 -LCB- to 21 after a delayed opening apparently prompted by an adverse report from a brokerage house. Later in the day the company said it expected lower second-quarter earnings, citing a slowing of retail bicycle sales. <ORGANIZATION> Maxus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> jumped 1 -LCB- to 8 -LCB- on top of a | - point gain The company declined to comment on the activity, which was evidently stirred by takeover rumors. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market lost $ 8.40 billion, or 0.33 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks dropped .57 to 143.66. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index fell 1.76 to 292.55, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was down 1.21 at 253.42.

 The on-again, off-again deal between <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> and <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> to split up hotel-casino operator Resorts International was officially sealed Friday, the millionaire entrepreneurs announced. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, the TV talk-show host turned investor, will pay approximately $ 300 million for the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, company controlled by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, the men said. Using his profits from the deal and other funds, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> will buy back the company's unfinished crown jewel, the vast Taj Mahal casino in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, for $ 230 million. `` It looks like this is it,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON>'s brother and executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trump </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` We are pleased, as I think Mr. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> is pleased.'' The agreement, in contrast to a handshake deal that collapsed May 11 amid mutual recriminations, is definitive, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said. The agreement calls for <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, Resorts' chairman, to get a total of $ 160 million _ $ 135 a share, or about $ 100 million, for his Class B shares, and $ 60 million to terminate his management contract. The Class B shares, which carry special voting rights, give him 88 percent control of the company. In addition, <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, through <ORGANIZATION> Griffin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, agreed to pay approximately $ 200 million, or $ 36 a share, for all the company's common stock, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> agreed to pay $ 230 million for the <ORGANIZATION> Taj </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mahal </ORGANIZATION>, a grandiose project plagued by construction delays, and certain other assets. That purchase is subject to certain closing adjustments, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> first offered to buy Resorts on March 17 for $ 35 a share. After weeks of sparring, the men in April announced an agreement nearly identical to the one closed Friday, only to cancel it a month later, with <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> accusing <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> of failing to line up financing and <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> accusing <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> of seeking last-minute changes.
