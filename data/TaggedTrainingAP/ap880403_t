<HEAD>With PM-World Easter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The following are excerpts from the official <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> translation in English of Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s Easter Sunday message, `` Urbi et Orbi'' -LRB- To the City and World -RRB-, given in Italian: Queen of heaven rejoice! Behold, precisely today on this first day after the Sabbath the women went to the tomb, where the body of your son had been laid, having been taken down from the cross, and they found the stone rolled away, and the tomb empty. From within the tomb they heard a voice: `` Do not be amazed; you seek <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nazareth </LOCATION>, who was crucified. He has risen, he is not here.'' Rejoice, queen of heaven! Rejoice, mother of Chirst! `` But go, tell his disciples and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>.'' Then <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdala </PERSON> ran to tell the Apostles: `` They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they haven laid him.'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> went at once to the place, and they found that it was as the women had said. He is not here. He is not here, in the place where they laid him, in the tomb. He is not here _ he has risen. Rejoice, queen of heaven! Rejoice, queen of heaven. ... What the tongues of the first witnesses now proclaim had first been foretold by himself. `` Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.. he spoke of the temple of his body.'' His scourged, tortured crucified body; his head wounded by the thorns; his side pierced by the lance. He is not here. ... Rejoice, queen of heaven! Rejoice, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, rejoice, mother! You bore his body in your virginal womb, you bore within you the God-man. And then you brought him forth on the night of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, you bore him in your arms as a child. You bore him into the temple on the day of his presentation. Your eyes _ more than the eyes of anyone else _ saw the incarnate word. Your ears heard him, from his very first words. Your hands touched the word of life. Rejoice, queen of heaven! `` He whom you bore has risen.'' You bore him, even more than in your arms, in your heart. Particularly during those last hours, when you had to stand beneath the cross, at the feet of the divine condemned one. Your heart was pierced by the sword of sorrow, in accordance with the words of the aged <PERSON> Simeon </PERSON>. And you shared the sorrow as you associated yourself, with your maternal soul, in the sacrifice of your son. O mother! You consented to the immolation of the victim whom you had borne. You lovingly consented _ with that love which is planted in your heart. With that love which is stronger than death and stronger than sin, in the whole history of man on earth. And then, when he had breathed his last, and they had taken him down from the cross, he rested once more in your arms, as he has rested so many times before as a child ... And then, they laid him in the tomb. They took him from your maternal arms and gave him back to the earth; they closed the tomb with a stone ... And behold, now the stone has been rolled away, the tomb is empty. Christ whom you bore is risen, <PERSON> Hallelujah </PERSON>! Rejoice, queen of heaven! This is the day of the church's Easter joy we all share in your glory, O mother ... Everyone, the whole church of your son, the whole church of the incarnate word. Christ whom you bore is risen! Pray for us! Your who were present in the deepest possible way in the mystery of Christ. Behold, the whole church today looks to you, O <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. Even though we do not see you among the people about whom the accounts of Easter tell, we all look to you. We look to your heart. Could any narrative record the moment of the resurrection of the son in the heart of his mother? Yet we fix our gaze on you. The whole church shares in your Easter joy the whole church knows that on this day that the Lord has made you `` go before'' in a singular way along this path of pilgrimage of faith in paschal mystery. Pray for us! During this year which has been dedicated in a particular way to you, during this Marian year, be present in a special way in the church, be present along all the paths of the people of God, paths upon which shines the light of Christ. Let this light never leave anyone, this light of the new life which is he himself, the risen one!

 The legacy of the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, assassinated 20 years ago Monday, was remembered around the country Sunday by blacks and whites continuing the fight for racial equality and social justice that <PERSON> King </PERSON> began. `` Twenty years later, everything has changed and nothing has changed,'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> conference, a civil rights organization formed by <PERSON> King </PERSON>, said Sunday night at a memorial service in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s poor are as bad off as ever, speakers told the 500 people attending the service at the <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> where King gave his `` Mountain Top'' speech on the eve of his murder at the <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Motel </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> `` I've been to the mountain top ... I've looked over, and I've seen the promise land,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said in the speech `` I may not get there with you, but I want you to know tonight, that we as a people will get to the promised land.'' <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, said the address was one of the most emotional he had heard King deliver. `` It was a tremendous experience,'' <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON> said before speaking to about 500 people attending the <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> service. Hooks urged the audience to renew its commitment to King's `` poor people's campaign,'' which was under way at the time of his death `` So Dr. <PERSON> King </PERSON>, we have n't made it yet ... but we are determined from this day, we are going to march forward, and ai n't nobody going to turn us around,'' he said. On Monday in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, a memorial sponsored by the city is to begin with a ceremony at the <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON>, followed by the beginning of a <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> march through <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. That march is to conclude April 30 in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. A simple wreath-laying ceremony will be held Monday afternoon at King's tomb in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> at the Martin Luther King Jr.. Center for Nonviolent Social Change King's widow, <PERSON> Coretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, has long favored an approach focusing on her late husband's life, not his death. Last year, she came out in opposition to plans to make the <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Motel </PERSON> a museum, and said she did not want such a project to bear his name. Also in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION> planned to hold its ninth annual `` Drum Major For Justice'' awards dinner Monday night. The event takes its title from a phrase King used to describe how he wished to be remembered. This year's honorees include <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Espy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, singer <PERSON> Dionne </PERSON> <PERSON> Warwick </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Redskins </ORGANIZATION> quarterback <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sharissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, 17 and a senior at <ORGANIZATION> Greensboro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dudley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, worries that her generation may not hear King's story often and powerfully enough `` Black people have made progress since King's assassination, but I do n't think we have gone as far as he would have liked,'' she said. `` His message was to help other people as much as we can. But my generation is so hooked on themselves, they do n't have time.'' In <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, nearly 100 people on Saturday joined in a 1.5-mile walk to mark King's assassination on April 4, 1968. `` When people gather together there is hope,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Herndon </PERSON>, co-director of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. `` The message is there still are those who will stand up against racism.''

 A man apparently angry over a land dispute involving his former in-laws opened fire on mourners gathering for an Easter Sunday funeral, killing three and wounding three others including his ex-wife, authorities said. The shooting occurred in the parking lot of the <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, where family and friends gathered for a funeral service for <ORGANIZATION> Effie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, 79. The service had been scheduled to begin at 3 p.m., officials said, and the shooting took place shortly before that. `` It was just a really horrible experience, nothing I could ever have imagined,'' said <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Justice </PERSON>, a nephew of Mrs. Justice. Like most of the mourners, Justice was already inside the small, brick rural church when the shooting began but could hear the gunfire. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON>, 41, was charged with three counts of first-degree murder and three counts of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill, according to a release from the Henderson County Sheriff's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON> was being held without bond Sunday evening in the <LOCATION> Henderson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>, awaiting an initial court appearance set for Monday morning. Sheriff's Capt. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatchett </PERSON> said the dead were the parents of <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON>'s ex-wife, along with a 24-year-old man whose relationship to the family was not immediately determined. The three, <PERSON> Wilford </PERSON> <PERSON> Owensby </PERSON>, 61, of <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>; his wife, <PERSON> Ponnelle </PERSON>, 60; and <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowles </PERSON>, 24, were all pronounced dead at the scene, the sheriff's department said. Mrs. <PERSON> Owensby </PERSON> was Mrs. Justice's daughter The suspect's former wife, <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Kennesaw </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, was taken to <LOCATION> Margaret </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pardee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Hendersonville </LOCATION> where she was listed in good condition with bullet wounds in the neck, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, 30, of <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>, and her daughter, <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, 11, were both listed in critical but stable condition at <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Asheville </LOCATION>, said nursing supervisor <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Woody </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> was wounded in the chest, while her daughter was wounded in the leg, the hospital said. <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON> apparently confronted his former wife and her relatives in the parking lot, <PERSON> Hatchett </PERSON> said. `` There seems to be some sort of domestic thing, over conflict over some land,'' he said. The suspect owned land near the church which is adjacent to property belonging to Mrs. <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON>'s family, he said. Witnesses said the suspect walked into the church to view the body of Mrs. Justice, and then walked outside. Mourners in the church then heard gunshots. `` I understand they were having visitation when he came to the church. He apparently had weapons in a vehicle outside the church. He went outside and got them out of the trunk and then started shooting,'' <PERSON> Hatchett </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hatchett </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON> left the shooting scene on foot after dropping the weapons in the parking lot. He was arrested without incident a short distance away. Two weapons were found in the parking lot, a handgun and a shotgun, <PERSON> Hatchett </PERSON> said. Witnesses said Mrs. <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON> drove herself and her wounded sister and niece away from the church after the shooting, and her <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> sedan was riddled with bullet holes. The three were in the car when the shooting broke out, <PERSON> Hatchett </PERSON> said. The three reached the <LOCATION> Hendersonville </LOCATION> city limits, a few miles away, before authorities transferred them from the blood-stained car to ambulances. The funeral was canceled. Police were still interviewing witnesses at the church Sunday evening. <LOCATION> Edneyville </LOCATION> is an unincorporated town in a rural area in the western part of the state, about 20 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Asheville </LOCATION>.

 Police Chief <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> vowed Saturday to deploy 1,000 officers on gang-ridden south-central streets to keep Easter churchgoers safe after a drive-by shooting in which one man died and 12 others were wounded. Gang violence erupted later in the day when two gang members were wounded by gunfire after a confrontation between rival groups in a downtown parking lot, said police Lt. <PERSON> Orley </PERSON> <PERSON> Barton </PERSON>. The victims, both 21, were taken to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> County-USC Medical Center. A spokeswoman said one was in fair condition with a gunshot wound in the foot and the second, who was hit in the buttocks, was listed as serious. County Supervisor <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> sent a telegram to Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> urging him to declare a state of emergency in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and send in two companies of military police from the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> National Guard. `` The people of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> are increasingly living in a state of fear. No one is safe,'' he wrote. `` The governor is very concerned about the escalation of gang violence in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Brett </PERSON>. However, he would declare a state of emergency only after the city and county governments proclaim that such an emergency exists and that it exceeds the capabilities of local law enforcement officials, <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> said. No one had been arrested in Friday's shooting, but <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said police were investigating leads on two men seen shooting from a passing car. One of those wounded was a 4-year-old boy. The shootings came in the midst of a police crackdown on escalating gang violence, which only a day earlier prompted one <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> supervisor to call for help from the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> National Guard. `` If we were angry before, we are exceedingly angry now,'' <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said at a news conference where he called gang members `` rotten little cowards ... who shoot down 4-year-old kids.'' Plans were under way to put 1,000 officers on south-central streets where 200 officers usually patrol, <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said, adding that 300 officers would be out Saturday night. `` We have all this shooting going on on the holy weekend. People in south-central <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> want to go to church tomorrow and we're going to make sure they're safe,'' <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said. He also called for night sessions at all courts in order to speed up trials and put criminals behind bars, special courts to handle gang and narcotic cases, and a south-central justice center. Lt. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Massey </PERSON> said Friday's shots were fired on turf claimed by five or six gangs, and that the shootings probably were intended as some type of retaliation. Police believe a semi-automatic weapon was used. <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Bragg </PERSON>, 16, said he saw men in a Cadillac stop and talk to a group of people. `` All of a sudden they just opened up,'' he said. `` There were about 20 shots, I guess. Maybe more than that. You could hear them hitting the trees and the houses _ everything.'' The car sped off and then returned `` for another look'' before fleeing, <PERSON> Bragg </PERSON> said. At least 25 rounds were fired, <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said. Cmdr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> said 13 people were hit. Only 11 were accounted for at local hospitals. Authorities said two people may have sought medical attention on their own. Seven anti-gang police sweeps through the city in the past month, including one through the southside Thursday night, have resulted in 874 arrests and seizures of weapons, drugs, cash and cars. On Thursday, county Supervisor <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> asked Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> to call in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to help quell gang violence. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> cited 387 gang-related deaths within the county last year and said the gang-related death rate in the first three months of 1988 exceeds the rate for the same period last year. However, since the sweeps, the tally of gang-related homicides apparently has decreased, from 25 in March 1987 to 14 in March 1988, police said.

<TEXT>
 A former British fighter pilot was reported Sunday as saying Austrian President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> saved his life and those of other Allied prisoners during World War II by preventing them falling into the hands of Nazi executioners. The Sunday Times said the pilot, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON>, is the `` first and possibly the only British ex-serviceman to speak in defense of <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>,'' who denies accusations of involvement in war crimes when he was serving with the German army. <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON>, now 66, said he was in danger of being shot when he was found armed and in civilian clothes on the British-occupied Greek island of Leros in November 1943, the day after German paratroops invaded. He said he was taken to an airfield outside <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> where he met <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, who introduced himself by name and ensured that <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON> and others were sent to a prisoner-of-war camp instead of the Nazi SS, who shot prisoners. <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON> said <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> took the prisoners' identity discs and gave them substitutes which had been taken from the bodies of Allied servicemen killed in action. The discs enabled the prisoners to prove they were not commandos or spies. <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON> said he mentioned <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s help to <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION> who debriefed him after his release from a prison camp in May 1945.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> set off an underground nuclear test explosion early Sunday in the republic of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. The blast, the third nuclear test announced by the Soviets this year, was `` carried out with a view to upgrading military technology,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said.

The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> atom bomb dropped on <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, on Aug. 6, 1945, had a yield of 20 kilotons, or the equivalent of 20,000 tons of TNT.

 The army said an Arab youth was electrocuted Sunday when he tried to attach a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flag to a utility pole. Hospital officials said a second <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> died of gunshot wounds suffered last week in a clash with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. The fatalities came hours before the scheduled arrival of Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> for a third round of talks with Israeli leaders on his <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace initiative and while hundreds of Christians celebrated Easter in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The deaths also occurred a day after <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers shot and killed six <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> protesters in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, the highest one-day death toll in four months of unrest. The <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> newspaper quoted military sources as saying the army has adopted a new policy of entering even remote Arab villages to break up protests instead of ignoring demonstrators as long as they did not endanger lives or interfere with traffic on the main roads. `` The confrontations -LRB- over the weekend -RRB- were a result of our initiative,'' Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, about 1,000 pilgrims from around the world attended Easter Sunday services in the Church of the Holy Sepulcher where most Christians believe <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> was buried and rose from the dead. Church officials said the number of worshipers dropped by half from last year, apparently because many pilgrims were scared away by the violence in the occupied territories. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION>, 40 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, an army official said a 20-year-old Arab youth died early Sunday after being electrocuted when he tried to attach a red, white, black and green Palestinian flag, outlawed by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, to a utility pole. After receiving the shock, the youth fell from the pole and hit his head, said the official who, in keeping with army regulations, spoke on condition of anonymity. The youth was pronounced dead at <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> journalists identified the victim as 15-year-old <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarad </PERSON> and said he was shot to death by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. Officials at <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> could not immediately be reached for comment on the cause of death. At <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, a 40-year-old <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> died Sunday of wounds he suffered Wednesday in a clash with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. During the clash, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Diab </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village <LOCATION> Yatta </LOCATION>, was shot in the neck and paralyzed, said a doctor who spoke on condition of anonymity. His death brought to 134 the number of Arabs killed in four months of anti-Israeli protests, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures. The youth from <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> was not included in the count because of conflicting reports on the circumstances of his death. One Israeli soldier has died in the violence. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is scheduled to meet Monday with <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio quoted sources in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> as saying <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> planned to present to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders an invitation to an international peace conference which is to launch direct bilateral negotiations between the parties to the conflict. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> opposes key elements of the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> plan, especially a proposed international conference. The <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted a <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> aide as saying `` if <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> does n't present any new ideas in his talks with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> ..., the prime minister will not budge.'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> supports the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> plan.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> celebrated Easter Sunday Mass in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basilica </LOCATION>, then appealed for world peace and offered Easter greetings in 52 languages to thousands of worshipers in rain-drenched <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s Square. Among the thousands of people who packed <LOCATION> Christendom </LOCATION>'s biggest church for the Mass was <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who was to leave later in the day for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on a new <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace mission. The Mass, usually held on the flower-decked travertine steps of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s, was moved inside the church because of rain. But the pope later spoke from the church's central balcony as more than 100,000 people stood in the square below. In his traditional Easter message `` Urbi and Orbi'' -LRB- to the city of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and the world -RRB- following the Mass, the pope asked the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> to pray for peace, justice, human rights and religious freedom. Departing from his written text and speaking emotionally in a strong, hoarse voice, the pontiff said, `` Pray for peace in the world, for justice, pray for the rights of man, especially for religious freedom, for every man, for every Christian and non-Christian, pray for us.'' `` Pray for the solidarity of all peoples of the world, the first world, second, third and fourth, all the world,'' he said. `` In yours and our Easter joy, we carry again this weight of humanity, this weight of so many human hearts, our brothers, our sisters, and we repeat: pray for us.'' In a private audience on Saturday, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had received the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s blessing for his voyage. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic, was one of those taking Communion from the pope. Winter weather descended on <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> this weekend, with a cold, steady rain drenching the capital Sunday morning. It was decided at the last moment to move the service inside the basilica, where the pope celebrated Mass from an altar under the `` Baldacchino,'' the immense Baroque canopy designed by <PERSON> Bernini </PERSON>. The Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> estimated that 150,000 Romans, pilgrims and tourists _ most of them huddling under umbrellas _ stood outside in the square and its side streets and listened to the service broadcast on loud speakers by <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION>. The crowd broke into loud cheers and chants of `` Viva il Papa'' -LRB- long live the pope -RRB- when <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, keeping with tradition, appeared on the central balcony at noon to deliver his Easter message and blessing. The message was directed to the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, for whom the pope has a special devotion and dedicated the current Marian Year. `` Christ whom you bore is risen, Alleluia,'' said the pope, wearing a white robe trimmed in gold and a tall, gold miter, or bishop's hat. `` Queen of heaven, rejoice. This is the day of the church's Easter joy. We all share in your glory, oh mother.'' `` Behold the whole church today tooks to you, oh <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. Even though we do not see you among the people about whom the accounts of Easter tell, we all look to you ... `` During this year, which has been dedicated in a particular way to you, during this <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Year </PERSON>, be present in a special way in the church..'' Then, following his improvised plea for world peace, the polyglot pope wished the world a happy Easter in 52 languages The longest greeting was in his native Polish.

 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said its warplanes raided two oil refineries deep inside <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Sunday, but <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> said the bombs landed in residential areas and killed at least five civilians and wounded 50 more. The attacks signaled the rekindling of the `` war of the cities'' after a break of 2 -LCB- days. Hundreds of civilians have been killed or wounded in more than a month of missile and warplane raids on major population centers. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted a military communique as saying the strikes on the refineries near the cities of <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tabriz </LOCATION> were carried out at 2:40 p.m..

 Two <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> factory managers were expelled from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for embezzlement, on-the-job drinking parties and paying $ 1.6 million to two hockey players who masqueraded as machine operators, a Soviet newspaper said Sunday. The report in Pravda, the official paper of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was taken to be a message to party members at all state industries. Pravda also reported that party's <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> had disciplined two officials of the state <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine-Building </ORGANIZATION> involved in the errant enterprise. The report said the managers of the Salyut air transport machine-building enterprise engaged in embezzlement but it did not give a total figure for the losses suffered by the factory. Still, the newspaper gave several examples of excesses that cost in the tens of thousands of dollars, indicating the violations were broad. Factory director Y.V. <PERSON> Pugin </PERSON> and party committee chairman <PERSON> A.G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Samarkin </PERSON> were expelled, and other senior party officials at the plant and the ministry were reprimanded, the newspaper said. Under Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms aimed at improving economic performance, party members have come under close scrutiny. Only about 8 percent of Soviet adults gain entrance into the all-powerful party, and the <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is charged with ensuring that Communists set an appropriate example for other workers. Stories about the abuse of authority and inattention to the cause of poor performance have become common as the party carries out internal reviews of its personnel.

<HEAD>Candidate of the Downtrodden Gets Support from the Already
Uplifted</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, accustomed to bringing an uplifting message to the downtrodden, found a warm reception among the already uplifted at this chic ski playground. Looking to win delegates in Mondays' <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> Democratic caucuses, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> dropped in on the sunny, snowy resort high in the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> on Saturday afternoon. It was a visit that took the black civil rights leader and presidential candidate a long way from his usual audiences _ like the Hispanics who surged to touch him in <LOCATION> Pueblo </LOCATION>, and the striking meatpackers in <LOCATION> Greeley </LOCATION> who cheered wildly to his denunciation of the rich and powerful earlier in the day. `` I was surprised he came here,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheerer </PERSON>, a tanned and blond frequent visitor from <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> who strained to get <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the sights of her video camera as he arrived. `` I guess it's because the mayor invited him.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was greeted by the town's white, bearded mayor, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Stirling </PERSON>, a local real estate man who sported a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> bumper sticker across his white cowboy hat. Later, wearing a blue pin-stripe suit and bow tie, he danced and sang along with a recorded campaign song after introducing the candidate. `` People have said, ` Why Aspen?' It's too glitzy, too lily white, too middle class,'' the mayor said, his last remark drawing laughter. `` Well, we vote here too.'' Arriving after a day of skiing was <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> legislator and husband of actress <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>. He was n't endorsing <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, he said, but he had nice things to say about him. The gathering spilled out the door from the ornate room in the old <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Hotel </PERSON>, a recently restored three-story brick building that looks like it came straight out of the Old West _ but updated for the ski crowd. To get to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s speech, people walked past guests frolicking in the hotel's outdoor hot tub and through a bar with a giant chandelier made of antlers. Some who turned out were supporters, and some just seemed curious. Many wore bright ski suits. One man dressed in cowboy shirt and hat, face red from skiing, said on his way in: `` We're here for both _ <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> and the fashion show.'' He said there really was a fashion show in town, but he might have been talking about the affluent, all-white crowd's wardrobe Others claimed to be real supporters. At the <LOCATION> Pitkin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, where the idle private jets of <LOCATION> Aspen </LOCATION>'s visitors wait in rows, <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> was among the handful of greeters. `` I just think he's the best thing going,'' said <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, clad in a black leather miniskirt. She described herself as an author of children's books. Posters printed by local supporters invited people to see <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Included was a notice that the reception beforehand was `` for substantial contributors only -LRB- $ 100 to $ 1,000 -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spoke passionately, as usual, of the poor, but at the same time responded to his monied audience. The poor work, he said, and are all around, even in <LOCATION> Aspen </LOCATION>. `` They changed the sheets in the hotel you slept in last night,'' he said. `` The upper class can not remain upper if there is not a middle class,'' he told the substantial contributors. One man put a tough question to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>: did he back raising taxes as high as 60 percent on upper incomes like his own? It would discourage the creation of jobs, he said. `` To tax you 60 percent would be as absurd as a tax cut,'' responded <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who hours earlier had denounced President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for `` reverse Robin Hood'' _ taking from the poor for the rich. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> suggested the tax rates before President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1981 tax cut were reasonable. With the larger crowd, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> did n't miss an opportunity to ask for contributions to his campaign. `` Give like you live _ high,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> led in responsive chants as he does with other audiences _ evoking such shouts as `` vote'' and `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>.'' When they did n't get it right, he interrupted: `` Let's stop and do it right, do it with rhythm and soul. A few feet to the side, <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> was talking politics and speculating on a <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo-Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> ticket. `` Something very powerful is happening,'' <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> said. `` I do n't know if he can win in November, but nobody else is having an effect like this. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> seemed to enjoy his visit, too. The chanting done, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> grinned and waved. `` Okay, <LOCATION> Aspen </LOCATION>,'' he said.

<HEAD>Three Earthquakes Near Athens, Another On Corfu</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Three moderate earthquakes shook Athenians awake Saturday and Sunday while another strong temblor rocked the western resort island of <LOCATION> Corfu </LOCATION>. None of the quakes caused injuries or damage, authorities said. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Athens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seismological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said a strong quake measuring 5.0 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale occurred at 11:56 a.m. Sunday. Its epicenter was 212 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> in the seabed off the island of <LOCATION> Corfu </LOCATION>. The popular resort island has about 2,000 mostly British tourists visiting over the Easter holiday, local police said. Three other quakes registering 4.2, 4.6 and 4.4 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale rumbled through the Greek capital between 11 p.m. Saturday and 7 a.m. Sunday. `` The four quakes are not geologically connected, we rule out the chance of a disastrous quake coming from any of the areas ... so people should n't panic,'' Professor <PERSON> Yiannis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dracopoulos </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s senior seismologist, told state-run television. The <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> region has 3.5 million residents, a third of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s population The first two quakes had their epicenters 12.5 miles east of <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> in the seabed off the coastal town of <LOCATION> Loutsa </LOCATION>, while the third had its epicenter 47 miles northwest of the capital. An <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> police spokesman said the three quakes were felt throughout the capital, but did n't cause any injuries or damage. `` We had a lot of people calling in to find out what was happening but nobody panicked,'' said a police spokesman who requested anonymity. The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A magnitude 4 quake can cause moderate damage while a force 5 temblor can cause considerable damage.

 Under police and army guard, pilgrims from around the world gathered at dawn for Easter Sunday services in the church marking the site where most Christians believe <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> rose from the dead. About 1,000 worshipers _ half as many as last year _ attended services in the 12th century Church of the Holy Sepulcher, church officials said. Many pilgrims were scared away by four months of almost daily violence in the Israeli-occupied territories that have left more than 130 Palestinians and one Israeli soldier dead. The Greek Orthodox Church canceled three pre-Easter processions scheduled for the weekend. Security was low-key Sunday at the Crusader-built church, where about half a dozen uniformed police stood guard in the courtyard and at the entrance. But dozens of soldiers were stationed throughout the walled <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, some on rooftops and others patrolling the narrow cobblestone streets. An Arab attacker stabbed an Israeli policeman in the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Friday. `` Before we came, our friends were worried and said they would pray for us,'' said 71-year-old <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenbrock </PERSON>, a Lutheran from <LOCATION> Kankakee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` We've been fine, but someone was killed in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> yesterday -LRB- Saturday -RRB- a few hours before we visited,'' he added. `` There were boulders in the street, and it was tense.'' `` We were frightened before we came, but now that we are here, we feel it is safe,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiamachello </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, who attended the services with his wife and young son. `` For me, this was a very moving experience.'' Tourism ministry officials said they had no figures for the month of March, but acknowledged a 13 percent drop in tourism for the first week of the month as compared with a year ago. Officials also expressed concern about possible cancellations in April and May. Clouds of incense and organ music filled the church during the Latin service held in front of the marble-enclosed tomb marking the site where <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> is believed to have been resurrected. The Roman Catholic patriarch of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, Monsignor <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabbah </PERSON>, the first Palestinian to hold the post, presided over the service. Last week, he called on worshipers to make special Easter prayers for those caught up in the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. At the church entrance, visiting pilgrims kissed and pressed their foreheads to the rose-colored marble stone where followers are believed to have washed <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' body before his burial. Several worshipers dropped handkerchiefs to soak up some of the holy water that dampens the stone. Others walked upstairs to the candle-lit table marking the site where <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' cross is believed to have been buried. `` One feels very humble walking on the same soil where <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> walked,'' said <PERSON> Gale </PERSON> <PERSON> Crisher </PERSON>, 48, of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` My children could n't believe I was coming to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> now, but I felt have very comfortable here.'' While the Roman Catholics were celebrating Easter, Orthodox denominations were marking their Palm Sunday, walking along the Via <LOCATION> Dolorosa </LOCATION>, or Way of Sorrow, where <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, wearing a crown of thorns, was forced to carry the cross on which he died. Orthodox Christians celebrate Easter this coming Sunday. In the midst of the <ORGANIZATION> Easter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, about two dozen chanting Coptic priests and choir boys in long dark robes entered the church carrying palm leaves, some formed in the shape of a cross. Easter also fell on the third day of the Jewish holiday of Passover, commemorating the deliverance of the ancient Hebrews from slavery in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. Palestinian shopkeepers opened stores around the church from morning until noon, the times permitted by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has ordered afternoon strikes in <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to protest the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. But even merchants who remained open complained there was little business. `` I sold about $ 1,000 worth of items a day last year during Holy Week. This year, I'm lucky if it is $ 100,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mannix </PERSON>, a Jerusalem-born Palestinian and owner of a shop selling olive-wood crosses and icons. `` Last Easter my store was filled to the doorway and people were crowded on the streets outside,'' the 32-year-old <PERSON> Mannix </PERSON> added. `` This year, there is no one.''

<TEXT>
 Two years after a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing raid shocked the nation, Libyans are breathing a bit easier. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, their leader and the target of the attack, is permitting some long-awaited, though small steps to fix the economy. He is also calling for greater personal liberty. `` And it's true, right, that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ca n't become president again?'' asked a Libyan military man, confident that life is looking up for his countrymen. For the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president, Col. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> was the `` mad dog of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>'' and a sponsor of terrorism, including 1985 attacks on airports in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. To <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was the `` Israeli dog'' in the `` black house,'' the villain behind the April 15, 1986, bombing, which Libyans say killed the colonel's baby daughter and 36 other people. The good-guy, bad-guy rhetoric drew attention from an economy badly needing direction, especially after falling oil prices flattened <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s plump cushion of petroleum income. The global theater also overshadowed the growing demands of Libyan consumers. Now <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> seems bent on ensuring his popularity by improving life for his more than 3.5 million countrymen in the North African nation. Of course, motives are often difficult to judge in the case of the mercurial colonel who came to power in a 1969 coup and who is now simply called `` the leader'' by Libyans. Some observers think the 45-year-old <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> may have decided to reform his virulent anti-Americanism, which sometimes made him an easy target of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> outrage. Others think <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> may also have been affected by an <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> appeal in July to end an alleged policy of assassinating opposition figures. While slogans denouncing purported American aggression are still plastered on buildings, one diplomat says that there has been a quiet exchange of messages between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> governments indicating a desire, if not to improve relations, at least to keep channels open. There are several signs <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> may also have decided to push for a more liberal economy. A <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> newspaper last month reported that small businesses are now permitted to import items, such as automobile parts, previously allowed only for government-franchise holders, and sell them at a profit. Diplomats were apparently told to improve distribution of consumer goods, and more private businesses were allowed to operate. Insisting repeatedly that Libyans must produce for themselves, <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> has tried to reduce dependence on imports, especially after <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s oil revenues dropped dramatically from a 1980 peak of $ 22 billion. By 1986, lower oil prices saw annual revenue plummet to less than $ 6 billion. Prospects for slightly higher oil prices this year could put income at about $ 6.5 billion. On <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>'s shopping streets, business seems to have grown over the past year. Freshly slaughtered fat chickens hang from doorways enticing customers. Women _ some shrouded head-to-toe in white cotton, others in form-fitting, olive green military pants and jackets _ examine satin-striped fabric, while men try out imported calculators. It seems every other store window has cheap leather shoes, vinyl pocketbooks and suitcases. A diplomat reports that in the past year the government, which likes to boast of an extensive health care system, is allowing Libyans to buy Western currency and go abroad, ostensibly for medical treatment. One thing that has n't changed in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, though, is the ground rule of anonymity which covers conversations with diplomats, businessmen and the few Libyans willing to give their reading on what's happening. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> has been focusing as well on personal liberties. One afternoon last month, the masterful user of the media rode a bulldozer to knock down the gate of a <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> prison. To the cheers of one of the largest rallies in the capital in years, according to a diplomat, <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> declared that the released inmates included some who had plotted to kill him. A week later, <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> called for abolishing the death penalty in a nation where hangings have been broadcast on state television. On March 28, <PERSON> Gafhafi </PERSON> announced that all arrests should be backed by a court order. `` This is a very good thing,'' said a smiling Libyan, relaxing in a lounge a few hours after the speech. `` Now members of the Revolutionary Committees just come up and take people away without warning.'' The committees are <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s watchdogs of revolutionary ideology. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> also announced he is withdrawing troops from eastern <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> as a goodwill gesture toward its eastern neighbor, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, with which it has been feuding for 15 years.

<HEAD>Arrests Seen As Setback But Movement Far From Crushed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Communist rebels suffered a major setback with the recent arrest of their top leaders, but military officials and analysts say the insurgents are far from beaten. Through their 19-year rebellion, the guerrillas have demonstrated remarkable resilience. Despite harsh crackdowns, their influence has spread from the countryside to urban centers, attacks have stepped up and captured leaders have been replaced immediately. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who has vowed to crush the insurgency before her term expires in 1992, hailed last Tuesday's arrests of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> commander and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s No. 2 man as the beginning of the end. `` It clearly demonstrates that we have turned the tide and are winning the war against the Communist insurgency,'' she said in a statement. But military officials and others say the president may have spoken too soon, although they acknowledge that the arrests were a big blow to the 25,000-strong guerrilla army. `` It will disturb some of their programs,'' Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Biazon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> area commander, said of the arrests. `` But to say that this means the defeat of the Communist movement may not entirely be correct because we are fighting an idea, and the idea is still there.'' <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Tatad </PERSON>, a columnist and former information minister under ousted President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, noted the insurgents not only survived but expanded after the capture of party founder <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Sison </PERSON> and former rebel commander <PERSON> Bernabe </PERSON> <PERSON> Buscayno </PERSON> in the mid-1970s. <PERSON> Tatad </PERSON> said the rebels now enjoy broad support among workers, students, the clergy and other groups in society and that the government must improve its services `` to make the very idea of insurgency obsolete.'' Still, the arrests of rebel commander <PERSON> Romulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON>, Secretary-General <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Baylosis </PERSON> and four other rebels marked a dramatic success for the government. They came as the military was on alert for rebel attacks marking last Tuesday's 19th anniversary of the rebel force. Instead it was the military which struck, raiding Communist hideouts in the capital. The arrest of <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON>, 37, is especially significant. <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON>, a master guerrilla strategist, was widely believed to have organized assassination squads known as `` Sparrow Units,'' which brought the guerrilla conflict from the countryside to the cities. Police say up to 4,000 Sparrows are deployed in metropolitan <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, where they have killed more than 150 police, soldiers and government officials since January 1987. Veteran journalist <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Soliven </PERSON> wrote in the Philippine Star that for the first time in years, the rebels are `` now sweating it out.'' But he warned against complacency. The rebels `` are so desperate at this juncture that they may unleash a series of furious attacks and ambushes, just to create the impression that the movement remains strong,'' <PERSON> Soliven </PERSON> wrote. Sen. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Saguisag </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s former spokesman, agreed it was too early to say whether the arrests have dealt a fatal blow to the insurgency. <PERSON> Saguisag </PERSON> said one factor favoring the government is Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s continued popularity. Another, he said, was the ongoing attempt to hammer out a land reform act. He said since Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> took over from <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> on Feb. 25, 1986, she has introduced broad social and economic reforms. <PERSON> Saguisag </PERSON> acknowledged that substantial disaffection remains but `` it is nowhere like the disenchantment with <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, which was across the board.'' Even more than a debacle for the rebels, the arrests are seen as a morale booster for the underpaid, ill-equipped Armed Forces of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Since Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> took office when a military-civilian uprising deposed <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, the 160,000-member armed forces has been wracked by divisions that resulted in at least half a dozen coup attempts. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> says those days are over. He said the arrests show the military is now a united, effective force. <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> spoke before the escape Saturday of former Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, leader of a failed coup attempt in August. Many Filipinos saw the escape as a blow to the prestige and unity of the armed forces. The significance of Tuesday's arrests may well depend on the accuracy of intelligence reports of a bitter power struggle within rebel ranks. According to military officials, the infighting is between those favoring violent struggle and others who want the movement to expand politically among the rural population. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON>, the capital's chief law enforcer, predicted that Tuesday's arrests will deepen divisions among the rebels because each faction will blame the other for the setback. Much also depends on how much foreign assistance flows to the rebels. Military officials say the funds come from leftist groups in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Armitage </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistant defense secretary, told a <ORGANIZATION> congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this week that the Soviets were sending money. Soviet diplomats here deny the charge.

 Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the indicted strongman of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, may be running out of time and options in his stubborn quest to remain in power. The man President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> once called a `` tin-horn dictator'' so far has relied on brute force, threats and intimidation to maintain his grip on the nation. But despite another harsh crackdown on his opposition last week, many diplomatic and other observers feel <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> can count his remaining days on his fingers and toes. `` He really does n't have anywhere to turn,'' said one Western diplomat late last week. `` He is almost totally without meaningful support, either within the country or abroad.'' Still, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has withstood four weeks of mounting economic pressure with such mulish defiance that another foreign diplomat, also speaking on condition of anonymity, was led to comment: `` This guy's proving to be harder to get rid of than fleas on a dog. The problem is becoming one of whether you have to kill the dog before the fleas will leave.'' Even <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official masterminding the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, acknowledged last week that he and others in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had misjudged the general's staying power <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, the assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> affairs, said the miscalculation was based in part on the successful use of economic pressure to remove presidents <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has cut off all economic and military aid to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, withheld about $ 6.5 million a month in user fees from the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, helped tie up more than $ 50 million in government funds on deposit in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks and eliminated some trade preferences. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> suggested the time had come to consider even harsher economic sanctions, up to a total trade embargo. That's a bridge the administration so far has been unwilling to cross for fear of so badly damaging the country that a post-Noriega government would be unable to pick up the pieces. `` We now realize that it is easier to remove civilian dictators than military ones,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. `` In analogous circumstances, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> were gone already.'' Some foreign diplomats in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> do n't see the situation here as analogous to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, regardless of any possible differences between civilian and military dictators. `` In the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, you had a <PERSON> Cory </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who provided a rallying point,'' said one, referring to <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. `` There's nobody like that here. There also are n't many people here who appear willing to risk their lives in the struggle In the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> we saw desperate people acting desperately.'' The diplomats and two private economists, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity, agreed there is little chance of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military intervention, despite <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision late last week to send an additional 1,300 soldiers to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to help the 10,500 already here guard the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> and protect American civilians. Indeed, only a day before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> announced his decision to send the new troops, the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> government issued a communique saying it had no intention of provking an excuse for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military action. The diplomats and economists also agreed unanimously that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s days are numbered by a rapidly souring economy that already has the general trapped in a fiscal maze with no outlet. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> went bankrupt last year, unable to make interest payments to any of the lenders to whom it owes $ 4.8 billion, one of the highest per capita debts in the world. Then, early this year, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted by two federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> that accused him of selling out his country to <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> drug traffickers in exchange for millions of dollars in bribes. After some weeks of apparent soul searching, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s president, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, called for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s dismissal, only to have the effort backfire with his own ouster in a thinly disguised coup orchestrated by the general. Three weeks ago, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>' chief deputy, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, and a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> legal officer came to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and offered <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> a deal: Accept offered asylum in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not pursue you. The general refused. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s ouster triggered a run on banks that forced their closure. The government, short of cash, could not pay its employees. Some disgruntled officers tried but failed to overthrow <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. And his civilian opposition heaped coals on the fire with a two-week general strike that began to crumble only late last week. Even with the anticipated reopening of most industries and businesses this week, the government and its people are so short of money and so unlikely to get a big cash infusion that there is no hope of a return to `` normalcy'' anytime soon. `` What we're seeing here is a revolution in slow motion,'' said one diplomat. `` It may be taking longer than anyone expected, but it's happening.''

<HEAD>Failed Stakeout Of I-75 Cat Burglar Results In Probation For
Officers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police patiently watched a stolen motorcycle for 17 days, 24 hours a day, in hopes of catching a burglar linked to nearly 200 break-ins, until one officer took a two-minute restroom break and the bike disappeared. Two <LOCATION> Alachua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's investigators involved in the failed surveillance were placed on six months of probation. The so-called Interstate 75 cat burglar, a cocky thief who police believe has occasionally helped himself to a snack while his victims slept soundly, has been linked to more than 180 break-ins in seven <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> counties along I-75. He remains at large. <LOCATION> Alachua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> investigators had their best shot at catching him in January, when a motorcycle stolen in <LOCATION> Citrus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> during one of the cat burglar's sprees was found at a <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION> apartment complex, the <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION> Sun reported Saturday. Teams of officers kept watch over the motorcycle from a motor home 125 yards away to see if the burglar would return to use it. But Sgt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> `` Bear'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> and Investigator <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Canchola </PERSON> said Friday that a combination of incredible luck on the burglar's part and a poor line of sight from their vantage point combined to doom the surveillance The $ 2,000 motorcycle was discovered parked at the apartment complex on Jan. 9. One resident remembered seeing a man drive away on it on the same day the cat burglar struck a <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION> neighborhood, and it was later returned to the complex. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Canchola </PERSON> said the discovery of the motorcycle was the only real break in the I-75 cat burglar cases, which have frustrated authorities since November. So two deputies at a time kept vigil, with the aid of a television camera and night-vision scope. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Canchola </PERSON> even took the precaution of disabling the motorcycle's engine so it could n't be started. On Jan. 16, <PERSON> Canchola </PERSON> was watching the TV monitor while <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> sat in the back of the motor home repairing other surveillance equipment, they said Friday. <PERSON> Canchola </PERSON> saw no one near the motorcycle, so he went to the bathroom for about two minutes. By the time both men got back to the monitor, the motorcycle was gone. `` We were so shocked that we were laughing,'' <PERSON> Canchola </PERSON> said. `` We thought somebody had moved the motorcycle and was playing a joke on us.'' Interviews with witnesses later revealed the cat burglar had snatched the motorcycle in a matter of seconds. The suspect drove up in a small pickup truck and parked just out of the investigators' line of sight. Then, without trying to start the disabled motorcycle, he wheeled it to his truck and lifted it in the back. The cat burglar did not hit <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION> that night, when law-enforcement agencies were at full alert. The motorcycle was later found abandoned in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Alachua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's spokesman <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said that city had several night burglaries at that time, but they have not been positively linked to the I-75 cat burglar. <PERSON> Canchola </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> wound up on probation and said Friday they still feel bad about losing their best chance at collaring the burglar. `` If we'd have caught him, we'd have been heroes,'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said. Instead, `` we just got burned this time,'' <PERSON> Canchola </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Lebanon Reportedly Becomes Big Heroin Center</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, long known as a supplier of hashish, has become one of the world's big heroin centers in the past few years as its economy and central government have collapsed, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. `` Almost all the militias are involved in some way in the trafficking of drugs,'' one intelligence official said. Several officials _ from the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> _ agreed to provide an overview of the drug situation in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on the condition their names not be used. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s role in the world's drug trade is discussed in the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s March report on narcotics. `` <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is reportedly the world's major producer of hashish, as well as a key processing and transit point for heroin,'' the department said in its report, called `` International Narcotics Control Strategy Report.'' Although <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has yet to approach places like <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in the volume of its drug trade, officials said the situation is worrisome because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has virtually no influence in the country, much of which is controlled by <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>, Druze and Moslem factions. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has few statistics about <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s drug trade, but it reportedly is a more than $ 200 million-a-year business. The Christians have long dominated the country's drug business, but other sects have moved into the business. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, one of four countries under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions for failing to cooperate in the war on drugs, has peace-keeping troops in parts of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The other countries on the sanctions list are <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. So chaotic is the situation in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Yonah </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, an expert on drugs and terrorism, described the country as `` turning back to the Middle Ages.'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> is at the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, a think tank. `` The central government ... has little control over the countryside where armed militia factions and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> hold sway,'' the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said in its report. The department said that much of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s drug activity occurs in the fertile <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, a region that is controlled by the Syrian military and was once the country's breadbasket. Syrian military officers `` profit from the trade and protect it,'' the report said. The <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, a pro-Iranian faction of Shiite Moslems thought to hold some of the American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, also has bases and support in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION>. In 1986, <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents were involved in a failed attempt to contact and pay the kidnappers in exchange for hostages. Poppy cultivation has replaced the growing of fruits and vegetables in some of the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION>'s fields, and farmers find it easier to make money cultivating drugs and producing foodstuffs, officials say. `` We have seen over the last few years a shift from traditional agricultural products to ... more poppy,'' one department officer said. With decline of the Lebanese pound, cultivating drugs has become a `` very lucrative, safe way of work,'' he said. Growing drugs is less hassle for farmers, too. Marketing is not a problem because the buyers often come to the source and pay cash, the official said. As a result of drug money, the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> has become a self-sufficient region within the tiny country, which is about the size of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. `` The farmers are very independent,'' often setting up schools and buying big-ticket items like electric generating equipment, an American said. The <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> has many of the country's heroin processing plants of which there are as many as 10. `` <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is not only a grower but also an importer of drugs,'' an American said. Imported drugs come primarily from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Drugs are often shipped out of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> through ports controlled by various militias. The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>'s interdiction program based in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, about 60 miles off <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s coast, has successfully halted some trafficking. As a result, Lebanese middlemen increasingly have relied on female couriers who leave the country overland through <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> or by plane with small amounts of drugs in body cavities or concealed in some fashion. Drugs from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> usually end up in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, officials say. But often couriers travel through <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> before reaching their final destination, enforcement officials say. Countries in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> have large Lebanese colonies. <PERSON> Addis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ababa </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s capital, and <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s capital, are favorite transit points for drug dealers from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and elsewhere because of their good airport facilities, officials say. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s burgeoning drug trade has led to more addicts inside the country, particularly among the militias and the young, college crowd. The Bekaa farmers, however, seem to have little use for drug consumption. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are not optimistic about making a dent in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s drug trade anytime soon. `` A comprehensive eradication and interdiction program must await restoration of central government control,'' the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report said. Official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy calls for national reconciliation in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and removal of all foreign forces. But drugs contribute to the breakdown in central order by giving the militias and factions an outside source of income, making them more flexible and independent. The traditional way for the private militias to finance their operations is through local taxation. `` In the long run, this -LRB- drugs -RRB- contributes to the emerging partitioning of the country,'' one official said.

 The effort to push stock market crash legislation through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> before lawmakers become preoccupied with the summer political conventions has produced some strange bedfellows. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, chairman of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s task force on the crash, has teamed with two of the administration's sharpest critics: <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis., and Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> finance <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s Republican credentials are impeccable. He is a former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senator from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, a member of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inner circle and a likely prospect for secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> in a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidency. Yet on the issue of reforming the nation's financial markets, he finds himself working closely with <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, whose `` Golden Fleece'' awards regularly skewer administration money-wasting, and <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, who made his name as a severe critic of the government's nuclear power bureaucracy and is now turning his attention to the regulation of the financial markets Arrayed against <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s proposals are three <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appointees: <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairwoman <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>. All three have praise for <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s research, but all three are vigorously opposing his proposals for changes in their agencies' jurisdiction Two months ago, under the glare of television lights in a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing room, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> uttered his now well-known warning regarding the fragility of the stock market: `` We are looking down the barrel of a gun, and the gun is still loaded.'' Since then, at every hearing the lanky Wall Street investment banker attends, he hears his words repeated by a Democrat eager to prod a laissez faire <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration into action. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> would clearly like to see legislation providing more uniform regulation of the markets, but he is just as clearly uncomfortable at hearing his words used as a political club against the administration. After one hearing, where <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> mixed lavish praise of <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> with complaints of administration foot-dragging, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> joked to reporters: `` I did n't say anybody was going to pull the trigger.'' The administration has created a working group to resolve differences among the regulatory agencies. It is due to report to the president by mid-May. But both <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> have painted the creation of the group as a delaying tactic by an administration that does n't want to offend entrenched interests and is prone to be skeptical of government regulation in the first place. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> says the working group is n't a bad idea, but nevertheless he has helped <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> write bills that will be finished before the administration is ready to make its recommendations. <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>'s bill is still being written, but <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> introduced his on Thursday. It would create an intermarket coordination committee and instruct the regulatory agencies to cooperate with it. Opposition from the agencies as well as infighting among legislators representing competing interests make the bill's prospects appear dim But because of <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s efforts, the sides are drawn less along party lines than some had expected. The day before <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> introduced his bill, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> was on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> drumming up support. As a result, five of the bill's seven co-sponsors are Republicans.

I've had people bring their kids from town to see the lambs.'' `` The ewe was perplexed when she first got up and saw all those babies,'' she said. `` She looked one way and then the other.

Lamb quints are a rare event, occuring about once in 600,000 deliveries, said <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, professor of animal and range science at <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The four females and one male are all healthy and hungry, Mrs. <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> said.

I get up every four hours at night to feed them. But they're eating more and more hay and oats, so soon I'll just feed them once a night.'' Fecundity is in the blood line. The sire and the ewe were both triplets, so there's no telling how large a litter the newborn lambs may eventually have, Mrs. <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>FCC Says It's Running Out of Viable Dial-A-Porn Complaints to
Investigate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has begun investigating two more <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> dial-a-porn services, but the agency says it is running out of complaints it can act on. `` I keep beating the bushes for new, specific complaints, but we just do n't have a lot of them,'' though the agency gets plenty of general complaints about dial-a-porn, said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s telephone enforcement division. For the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> to investigate possible violations of a federal law prohibiting transmission of sexually explicit messages to children, the agency needs information such as a phone bill and a statement that someone under 18 has reached the service without using a credit card, an access code or a descrambler, he said. `` I know there are violations out there, and I would love for concerned citizens to help us by bringing them to our attention because there is no way we can locate them in any other way,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> has jurisdiction over dial-a-porn when the calls cross state lines or are to, from or within the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Local calls are under the jurisdiction of the state. Complaints about dial-a-porn services have prompted many states to require telephone companies to block access to 976 and 900 numbers for residential customers who request it. Phone companies also have been responding to public pressure to disconnect or otherwise limit the availability of these services. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> sent letters last week to two <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> adult-message services advising them of `` apparent'' violations. They were given 30 days to respond. If violations are found, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> could levy fines of up to $ 50,000 per day for each day a violation occurred. The companies cited are <ORGANIZATION> Ramrod </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Redding </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and 2001 Enterprises of <LOCATION> Reseda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. Neither company was listed with telephone directory assistance and the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said it was unable to obtain phone numbers for the companies or their owners. The actions against both companies stemmed from the same complaint that generated an investigation, begun last Dec. 7, of another <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> provider of sexual messages, <ORGANIZATION> Intercambio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The complaint was from parents of a 16-year-old <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> boy who had made more than 280 calls to dial-a-porn services. The family was not identified. The complaint says the boy lost `` all respect for women in general'' as a result of the dial-a-porn messages he heard and is now seeing a psychiatrist. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> requires dial-a-porn providers to use an access code available only to adults or prepay with a credit card before they listen to the sexually explicit messages. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> also allows providers to scramble the messages so they can be heard only by someone with a descrambling device. The complaint against <ORGANIZATION> Intercambio </ORGANIZATION> and a separate one citing Audio Enterprises of <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, are pending while the commission re-evaluates the companies' messages in light of a federal appeals court ruling in January that the agency can restrict access only to obscene messages, but not indecent ones. The commission defines indecency as `` language or material that depicts or describes ... sexual or excretory activities or organs.'' Obscene material must appeal to the prurient interest, depict or describe sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and lack serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.

<HEAD>Drivers Owe Major Cities More Than $1.5 Billion in Unpaid Fines</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 It's a big-city motorist's nightmare: driving aimlessly for an hour or more seeking a legal parking space. Many succumb to the temptation of stopping in front of a hydrant or in a `` no parking'' zone. Then begins the gamble: will they get caught, and if so, do they pay up? An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> check of 13 major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities showed that they collect at least $ 380 million annually in parking fines, but many violators ignore the tickets and the backlog of unpaid fines totals more than $ 1.55 billion in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> alone. The amounts the two cities do collect in a year would be enough to finance the budgets of many smaller cities; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> collected an all-time high of $ 177 million in 1987 and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> brought in nearly $ 59 million. Some other large cities are good collectors, too: <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> got $ 38 million last year; <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, $ 24 million; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, $ 28 million; <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, $ 21.6 million. `` Cities have two purposes in imposing parking fines,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tepper </PERSON> <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` First, to keep the traffic flowing. Second, to collect revenues.'' Officials at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Parking Violations Bureau do n't forgive or forget; they refuse to write off about $ 1.4 billion in parking penalties dating back eight years. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> officials say their city is owed nearly $ 157 million in parking fines. Last month, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> demonstrated how cities use fines to persuade drivers to improve their parking habits. He announced that fines for illegal parking during rush hours would be nearly doubled, from $ 28 to $ 53. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said the city expects to collect an additional $ 6 million in the next year from the higher fines, which are aimed at motorists who clog the right lanes of major streets. He proposed using much of the revenue for improvements, such as building left-hand turn pockets, that would ease congestion. In <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, under a plan that took effect last week, 52,000 scofflaws with six or more unpaid parking tickets will have to pay their fines or lose their right to update, renew or replace their driver's licenses. Payments of parking fines rose from $ 386,000 in December to $ 956,000 in January after Mayor <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> announced the plan. City officials estimate that some 60,000 drivers owe $ 24 million in unpaid parking fines. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> officials said a similar non-renewal system has helped improve its collection percentage of parking fines from 20 percent to between 65 and 75 percent. Many cities also nab illegally parked cars with such measures as towing. <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> tows some 19,000 cars a year; any car with more than six tickets automatically goes on the towing list. `` We have a rather aggressive system,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Eubanks </PERSON>, who instituted a computerized tracking system 12 years ago when he took charge of city's <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Violations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. However, towing cars can backfire. About 15 percent of the cars impounded in <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rapids </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, are never claimed by their owners. Then there's the device known as the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boot </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- it was first used there in 1955 -RRB-, which can be locked on the wheel of a scofflaw's parked car, immobilizing it until unpaid fines are cleared up. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, last week joined such cities as <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> that use a boot. <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> attorney, refused to believe his car should have been `` booted.'' The week before, he said, he had paid $ 63 for six delinquent tickets. However, a check of city records showed that he owned a second car with eight overdue tickets. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> paid $ 89 in fines for his second car and $ 35 to remove the boot from the car he was driving. A month earlier, after a drop in the number of parking tickets issued by police was partly blamed for a city budget crisis, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> began to use the boot to corral cars whose owners had three or more unpaid tickets. On the first day the device was used, 70 drivers were `` booted'' and had to pay $ 100 just to have the device removed. Cities also use the carrot-and-stick technique to encourage scofflaws to pay their fines. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> collected $ 5 million last year in an amnesty period that allowed delinquents to pay tickets at half price. In <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, where an estimated $ 2.5 million in parking tickets is owed, an amnesty program last year brought in about $ 140,000. And <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, owed a similar figure in tickets, offers an annual amnesty period in which it waives late fees for those who pay up. Many cities do not know how much they collect or how much they are owed because of divided jurisdictions or because parking statistics are lumped in with other vehicular violations.

 The Democratic presidential candidates want to increase pressure on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to force change in that nation, while <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> generally favors pursuing the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's policies, a survey says. The Investor Responsibility Research Center's survey said the Democrats _ <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> _ differ dramatically from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the likely <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee, on what <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy should be toward <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the region. The center is a public policy group that tracks issues and investment in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, a country where blacks are denied social and political rights through a system known as apartheid. The country's racial segregation has attracted interest in <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, particularly among the black voters who have turned out in force for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s successes in the primaries ensure that the candidates' positions on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> will be scrutinized in 1988 <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who is black, has long stressed support for the oppressed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The survey, which was based on the candidates' statements and a questionnaire, show that Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for the most part endorses the policies the administration has pursued over the last seven years. Former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s only rival for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination, is the sole candidate seeking to repeal the 1986 sanctions that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> slapped on white-ruled <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, however, has done poorly in the primaries and is not expected to win the nomination. In contrast to the Republicans, the Democrats want the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to pursue a tougher line against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator who portrays himself a moderate, is less extreme than <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor. The latter two agree on many points. Here is a breakdown of the candidates' positions, according to the survey.

<HEAD>Sanctions and Disinvestment</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> want additional sanctions against <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> if <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> does not end its state of emergency, release political prisoners, remove the ban on the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ the outlawed political organization based in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> _ and enter into negotiations to repeal the apartheid laws. The two also have spoken in favor of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies pulling out of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> is more equivocal about more sanctions, saying he would consider them if <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> shows `` no real and dramatic progress.'' He said companies should make their own decisions on disinvestment. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would not recommend additional sanctions, but he would n't repeal those put in place in 1986 The House is considering a sanctions bill that amounts to a total embargo on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suggests the `` use of diplomacy and negotiations for constructive change rather than impose additional sanctions.''

 The Democrats pledge to have routine dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>. They also say <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> should negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> and other groups. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he would continue the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's periodic diplomatic contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Angola</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> want to stop <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the anti-communist <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebels headed by <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, and, if elected, they would extend diplomatic recognition to the Soviet-backed Angolan government. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> says he is troubled with the aid to the rebels, but that they must be incorporated into a political settlement. He does not promise to recognize the Angolan government. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supports aid to the rebels as a way of blocking Soviet encroachment in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. He would not recognize <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION> in an effort to compel the Angolans to begin talks with <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> and expel 40,000 Cuban troops from the country. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> views the Cuban troops as the most important obstacle to peace in the region. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> say that a South African pullout from <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> could lead to a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> withdrawal. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> maintains their troops in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> to protect the country from the Cubans in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Mozambique</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the Democrats agree with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's policy of backing the <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> government instead of the <ORGANIZATION> Renamo </ORGANIZATION> rebels, who are reportedly aided by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Zimbabwe</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The Democrats favor restoration of economic aid to <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>. Aid was cut off in mid-1986 after Zimbabwean officials insulted former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> at a Fourth of July party.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> made an emotional plea for peace, justice and human rights Sunday in an Easter message from a rain-soaked balcony overlooking 100,000 people in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s Square After a solemn Mass inside St. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>'s Basilica, attended by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, the pope wished the world a happy Easter in 52 languages. The Mass, usually held outdoors on the flower-decked steps of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION>, was moved inside <LOCATION> Christendom </LOCATION>'s largest church because of rain. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> then appeared on the church's central balcony, unprotected from the steady drizzle, and addressed an estimated 100,000 people in the square and millions more following by television and radio around the world. At the end of his traditional Easter message `` Urbi and Orbi'' -LRB- To The City of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and the World -RRB-, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> departed from his written text and made a special plea to the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. `` Pray for peace in the world, for justice, pray for the rights of man, especially for religious freedom, for every man, for every Christian and non-Christian, pray for us,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said, speaking in Italian in a strong, emotional voice. `` Pray for the solidarity of all peoples of the world, the first world, second, third and fourth, all the world,'' he continued. `` In yours and our Easter joy, we carry again this weight of humanity, this weight of so many human hearts, our brothers, our sisters, and we repeat: pray for us.'' Later, in another impromptu remark, the pope thanked those following on television and radio and urged them to `` pray to <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> and with <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> for all the people, all the families, all the people who suffer, especially for those countries where peace, justice and the means are lacking.'' Earlier in his prepared message, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> also addressed his words to <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, for whom he has a special devotion and dedicated the current Marian Year. `` Christ whom you bore is risen, hallelujah,'' said the pope, wearing a white robe trimmed with gold and a tall, gold bishop's hat `` Queen of heaven, rejoice. This is the day of the church's Easter joy We all share in your glory, oh mother.'' After a warm, sun-drenched early spring, winter returned to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> this weekend, with a cold rain drenching the capital Sunday morning and dampening the spirits of the hundreds of thousands of tourists visiting the capital for Easter. It was decided at the last moment to move the Easter Sunday Mass inside the basilica, where the pope celebrated the service from an altar under the `` Baldacchino,'' the immense Baroque canopy designed by <PERSON> Bernini </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, an Episcopalian, and his wife <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic, were in the front row of the packed church. Mrs. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was among those taking communion from the pope. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> left later in the day for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on the first part of his new <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace shuttle. In a private audience at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> on Saturday, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> had given <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> his blessing for the mission. A choir sang Byzantine verses in the ancient Slavic language Paleoslavonic, the first time they had been sung in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> at a papal ceremony since the ninth century. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials said it was meant to show solidarity with Christians celebrating the 1,000 th anniversary of their faith in what is now the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> The crowd in the square broke into loud cheers and chants of `` Viva il Papa'' -LRB- Long live the pope -RRB- when <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, keeping with tradition, appeared on the balcony at noon to deliver his Easter message and blessing. Afterwards, the polyglot pope offered brief Easter greetings in 52 languages ranging from English to Ukrainian to <LOCATION> Swahili </LOCATION>. The longest and final greeting was in his native Polish, addressed to `` all my fellow countrymen in my country and all around the world and to all those who in the midst of adversity and anxiety are trying to find a path.''

<TEXT>
 It's a grand wake for those who share the pain of Rep. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauzin </PERSON>'s dashed hopes for the governor's seat _ a cruise into the sunset to retire some of his $ 1.1 million campaign debt The six-day outing leaving Monday for the Mexican resorts of <LOCATION> Cozumel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION> is a smaller-scale version of former Gov. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>' 1983 trip to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Monte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carlo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> retired a $ 4 million debt as backers almost tripped over each other to pay $ 10,000 for the ride. But <PERSON> Tauzin </PERSON> said he will net only $ 250,000 from his trip aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>, which costs a mere $ 3,000 to $ 6,000 a head. `` It's a chance to be with my people, thank them personally and also do something nice for those who worked with us,'' the congressman said in a telephone interview from the tiny coastal town of <LOCATION> Chackbay </LOCATION> last week. With some wealthy backers paying for tickets they wo n't use, <PERSON> Tauzin </PERSON> said he is doling out their tickets to key people who worked in his 1987 campaign. In all, 250 people will set sail. <PERSON> Tauzin </PERSON> also sent letters to lobbyists telling them they would have a captive audience of several congressmen, who were invited along free of charge. He said he approached the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee about the trip and the cruise organizers `` will follow the -LRB- ethics -RRB- rules strictly.'' But <PERSON> Tauzin </PERSON> said he was n't sure how many would show up. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a political consultant, said about 30 cabins had been sold to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> politicians and businessmen as of last week. The cruise, <PERSON> Tauzin </PERSON> said, is no different from staging a cocktail party or dinner at a hotel to raise money to pay off campaign debts. `` It's a long, extended cocktail party,'' he said. <PERSON> Tauzin </PERSON>, along with <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, lost the governorship last fall to <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, who remains behind to deal with a debt no junket is likely to retire. The almost bankrupt state owes $ 2 billion.

 After investigators found four people shot to death at an <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> farm and a 70-year-old woman missing last July, the sheriff said, `` You find me <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>, and I'll probably tell you what happened.'' Last week, investigators found bones in a marsh that they believe are those of the missing <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunz </PERSON>. And now <LOCATION> Marathon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schillinger </PERSON> says it will probably be some time before he can tell the public what happened. No arrests have been made based on the discovery, but <ORGANIZATION> Taylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> Chief Deputy Sheriff <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Breneman </PERSON> predicted there would be charges. `` I'm not sure exactly how soon, but they're coming,'' he said. Miss <PERSON> Kunz </PERSON>'s son <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> says he arrived home after a night of drinking on July 5 and found his uncle, two aunts and his brother dead, each shot with a .22 - caliber His mother was missing. `` There was no reason for them to do this to my family,'' <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunz </PERSON> said last week after the discovery of the remains believed to be his mother. `` I hope they find who done it.'' Investigators ruled out robbery as a motive after they found about $ 1,000 in the home. Neighbors knew little about the family that lived on a 108-acre farm in a wooden house off a dirt road in central <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. The family rarely invited people into the cluttered house but did most of their business at the door, neighbors said. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunz </PERSON>, 55, lived in a trailer next to the house. The house had a wood stove and no indoor plumbing. But merchants said <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunz </PERSON> had bought a videocassette recorder and microwave oven for the family. Hardware store owner <PERSON> Gale </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiler </PERSON> said the woman also bought .22 - caliber ammunition a few weeks before the killings and complained that her family watched `` dirty movies'' on the She said the ammunition was for her younger son, 30-year-old <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunz </PERSON>, to shoot birds. `` You find me <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> and I'll probably tell you what happened,'' <PERSON> Schillinger </PERSON> said just after the killings. Miss <PERSON> Kunz </PERSON>, who never married, was described by people in town as the family matriarch who paid the bills and did laundry while <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> waited in the car. <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> also accompanied her to high school sports games. Miss <PERSON> Kunz </PERSON>'s sisters, <PERSON> Irene </PERSON>, 81, and <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>, 72, were seen less frequently by neighbors, who remembered the women working in their garden and wearing old-fashioned clothes. Their brother, <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON>, 76, had been ill and had retired from farming. As investigators probed the family's past, questions of incest, which first arose during a 1930s rape trial, resurfaced and have yet to be solved. Lawyers raised the possibility of incest during the trial of a 40-year - old neighbor whom <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunz </PERSON>, then 15 and pregnant, had accused of attacking her Her mother denied the incest accusations and the neighbor was convicted in 1933 of statutory rape. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunz </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sentinel </ORGANIZATION> in an interview after the killings that he thought <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunz </PERSON> was his father. Authorities based their identification of the remains found last week on clothing _ `` some tattered, some scattered, some with'' skeletal remains _ found in the marsh about 16 miles north of the <LOCATION> Kunz </LOCATION> farm, Lt. <PERSON> Elwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said. The bones and clothing were taken to the state crime laboratory in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> for forensic tests, expected to take several days. Around six months after the killings, police questioned several people and held a 21-year-old man in jail over a weekend for interrogation. But they released him without charges and no one else was arrested. In mid-March, investigators gathered reporters from as far away as <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> and escorted them to a manure pit, where authorities dug for three days without finding any evidence. Police said a detective found the remains last week on the basis of information from an informant whom they would not identify. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schillinger </PERSON> said there are more than one but fewer than a dozen suspects in the case, but would not say if the discovery of the remains eliminated any suspects or drew their focus to anyone in particular. `` I do n't think it adds any new questions,'' said <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, who has been heading the investigation. `` We may have eliminated some. You do n't know.''

 Thousands of Roman Catholics marched peacefully in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> on Sunday to commemorate the 1916 Easter Rising against British rule in what is now the <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Police abandoned a short-lived policy of staying away from funerals and other occasions organized by sympathizers of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and mounted heavy patrols around the main march through the Catholic ghettos of west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. Armored Land Rovers, with officers riding shotgun, drove at the head and tail of the mile-long procession. About 5,000 people, waving <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> tricolor flags, marched to the sound of pipe bands to the Catholic Milltown cemetery. Police reported no incidents at the parades in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>, the second largest city, and 10 smaller centers across Protestant-dominated <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. British troops, with rifles cocked, also patrolled the west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> route, lined by Catholics wearing orange, green and white badges, the tricolor colors, embossed with a lily. The flower is the symbol of the 1916 uprising in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>. The uprising led to independence six years later for the overwhelmingly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> republic. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, at the insistence of Protestants in the north, retained control of the six northern counties, which now make up <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The Easter Sunday parades marked the start of the annual marching season in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> where Protestants and Catholics separately commemorate key dates of their troubled history. Protestant marches were due to begin Monday. In <LOCATION> Milltown </LOCATION> cemetery, where a Protestant gunman killed three people in a March 16 attack on an unpoliced <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> funeral, police ringed marchers as they thronged round a memorial to guerrillas killed in the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s bomb-and-bullet campaign to end British rule. `` We have a message for the British government,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuinness </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s legal political wing. `` We will demoralize you. We will make your six counties into a millstone which will strangle you.'' Police stared silently as the crowd burst into applause when <PERSON> McGuinness </PERSON> declared: `` Our strategy ... is to sap the political will of the British government and the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> people to remain in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The means are limited guerrilla warfare against the crown forces.'' The Royal Ulster Constabulary ended its no-policing policy after an upsurge of sectarian violence last month culminated in the murder of two British soldiers who drove into an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> funeral March 19. Sunday's march passed close to the spot where the two signals corpsmen, in plainclothes, were dragged from their car by the funeral mob, beaten and then shot by <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> gunmen. The spate of killings, in which 12 people died, began March 6 when British commandos fatally shot three unarmed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas who were on a bombing mission in the British colony of <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>. A total of 2,638 people have been killed since sectarian violence erupted in 1969. <PERSON> McGuinness </PERSON> denied published reports that the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is considering abandoning violence. `` The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> position has been on the record for years,'' he told reporters. `` They have stated there will be no more cease-fires.''

 Liberals and conservatives, often at loggerheads on social programs, are in rare agreement on expanding eight children's programs, citing independent research that shows the programs work well and save the government money.

Whereas there was wholesale `` spare-no-program'' cutting in the early years of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency, <PERSON> Coates </PERSON> said, members are more discriminating now and willing to spend money on programs that work. `` Absent these standards, you do n't get new money,'' said Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., chairman of the children's committee and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the House budget resolution provides several hundred million dollars in increases above inflation for the eight education, health, nutrition and employment programs. The report released this weekend is an update of a 1985 report and contains 25 additional studies that reinforce the original findings. `` This update gives more credence to the initial effort. It can serve as a very important guideline to the new administration,'' <PERSON> Coates </PERSON> said. The report discusses research findings by universities, government agencies and other sources in the areas of Medicaid; supplemental nutrition for pregnant women, infants and children -LRB- WIC -RRB-; youth employment; preschool education; compensatory education; handicapped education; prenatal care; and immunizations. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the report and the update were prompted by the skeptical `` prove-it'' reaction encountered by advocates when they argued that short-term investments would produce long-term savings. He said the initial compilation was instrumental in persuading lawmakers to stop cutting those programs and led to increased spending on them in subsequent years. `` The key is to back it up with research,'' <PERSON> Coates </PERSON> said. The largest child-program increases in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget resolution _ a non-binding spending blueprint _ include $ 210 million for the compensatory education program for children at academic risk and $ 170 million for handicapped education. Other substantial hikes would go to the WIC program -LRB- $ 150 million -RRB- and Head Start -LRB- $ 77 million -RRB-. Among the newer findings cited in the report: _ National math and reading rankings of students in the compensatory education program increased in every grade except 12th _ It costs only $ 500 to provide a year of compensatory education to a student at risk of academic failure while it costs more than $ 3,000 for a student to repeat a grade _ A pregnant woman not participating in <LOCATION> WIC </LOCATION> increased her chances of having a low-birthweight, high-risk baby by 60 percent in one <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> county _ For every $ 1 spent on <ORGANIZATION> WIC </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, about 49 cents was saved _ The incidence of nutritional anemia virtually disappeared at an inner city health center from 1971 to 1984; the researcher said 95 percent enrollment in <LOCATION> WIC </LOCATION> probably was the reason _ For every dollar spent on childhood immunization, the government saves $ 10 in medical costs

 For 10 months paroled rapist-mutilator <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> has lived a hermitlike existence in a trailer at the state prison, the only place authorities could find for him after he was driven out of town after town. On April 25, his parole _ and his stay at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> _ will come to an end. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> will be able to walk away a free man, under no obligation to tell officials where he will settle. The 60-year-old ex-convict bears little resemblance to the burly, hard-drinking ex-sailor convicted of raping and sodomizing 15-year-old hitchhiker <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> in 1978 and chopping off her forearms with an ax. Today, he lives on a small Social Security grant and spends his days tending the yard around his trailer in a remote corner of the 1,000-acre prison grounds. Although not formally under guard, he observes a 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew and is watched by at least one parole officer when he leaves the grounds for weekly visits to a psychologist, officials said. `` When he wants to go shopping, he asks us because he has no transportation,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, regional parole administrator for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>. `` Technically, we have him under surveillance. He can walk around on his own, but for all practical purposes we are escorting him.'' `` If it were n't for the press calls, we would n't know he was out there,'' said prison spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Langerman </PERSON>. `` Out of sight is out of mind. Anyone out on the streets has more to fear from the unknown _ the guy with the tattoo next to them in the supermarket _ than from this poor little burned-out guy under escort.'' <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> does not grant interviews, but has had occasional visitors, including ex-wife <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, a retired nurse who offered him a home but was refused by parole authorities, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Winkle </PERSON>, a Corrections spokesman. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> served nine years, 11 months of a 14-year, four-month sentence in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Men's Colony at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION>, receiving an early release for good behavior and through a work-credit program, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> said. The early release infuriated residents of a half-dozen small communities where authorities tried to place <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> last spring. In Rodeo, about 25 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, a mob of 500 people forced officers to move <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> under armed guard from a hotel room. Finally, in June, Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> placed at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> for the duration of his one-year parole. Once his parole ends, <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> is under no obligation to tell officials whether he will settle in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, near relatives, or elsewhere, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> said. `` I hope he goes to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The victim and her parents will feel much better knowing he is gone,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahden </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> supervisor who fought <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>'s release to her county. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>, who now has a child, declined to be interviewed but said last year, before <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> was paroled, that she still fears her attacker. As a condition of his parole, <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> takes a drug that would make him extremely ill from any amount of alcohol, even if splashed on in an aftershave lotion, <PERSON> Langerman </PERSON> said. `` He is completely, absolutely defused as a threat to society,'' the spokesman said. `` If he takes a drink, he will fall down retching, so you do n't have to worry about him going on a bender and going out looking for a hitchhiker.'' But once <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>'s parole ends, he is not required to continue the drug, called disulfiram, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> said. `` Yes, there is a concern. He claims he does n't really need it. He does n't lose that much control, according to him,'' <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> maintains, as he did at his trial, that he is innocent and was mistaken for another man. `` I think, if anything, he's worse now,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Stahl </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Stanislaus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor at <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>'s trial. `` He has not taken responsibility,'' <PERSON> Stahl </PERSON> said. `` He lives in a bizarre fantasy land and acquits himself each day. He does n't accept his guilt and resolve never to do it again.

<TEXT>
 A 10-year-old fifth grader is asking New Yorkers for quarters to help him become a doctor and find a cure for the diabetes that killed his grandmother and is sapping the health of his grandfather. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Brack </PERSON> sent $ 10 and this handwritten letter to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Daily News: `` Dear Sir, `` Can you please print this for me. I hope this $ 10 will help the cost for 1 or 2 days in your newspaper. `` HELP `` I am 10 years old and want to go to college when I grow up. My grandma died 3 weeks ago from diabetes at 56 years young. I want to find a cure for diabetes as my other grandpa has it to. Please send a 25 -LRB- cents -RRB- and it will grow in the bank until then. Thank you. `` <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Brack </PERSON> `` Box 191 `` <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> 52322'' The $ 10 was not enough to cover the cost of a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> advertisement, but <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> got his picture and a story about his plea on page two of Sunday's Daily News. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> was extraordinarily close to his grandmother, <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Brack </PERSON>, said his mother, <PERSON> Dianna </PERSON> <PERSON> Brack </PERSON>. Since both his parents work, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> went to his grandmother's house, about four blocks from home, every day after school The elder Mrs. <PERSON> Brack </PERSON>, 56, had undergone the amputation of one leg in January and her eyesight was failing, but she seemed to be doing well under the circumstances, the family said. She died Feb. 1, just hours after having dinner with <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>'s family A couple of weeks later, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> decided something must be done about diabetes and that he could be the one to do it. The idea of making a public request for funds came from the syndicated newspaper column of <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, who wrote about a college student who gathered thousands of dollars by asking for one penny from every person who read <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>'s column. `` He's very serious about becoming a doctor and doing something about diabetes,'' his mother said. `` He's a nice, sensitive kid who thinks about people other than himself.'' <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> told the Daily News: `` I want to go to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> and train to be a doctor. Then I can help stop these bad things happening.''

<TEXT>
 A senior Iranian official said Sunday that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would retaliate for <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s renewed attacks on Iranian cities by launching new ground offensives. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also revealed that a month of Iraqi air and missile attacks on Iranian cities has left 1,145 people dead and another 4,000 wounded. Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Javad </PERSON> <PERSON> Larijani </PERSON> said any suggestion that the `` war of the cities'' could change the military balance is `` a joke.'' `` They sent more than 100 missiles into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and that could not change anything,'' he added. By Iraqi count, 105 missiles have been fired into the Iranian capital. <PERSON> Larijani </PERSON> said an Iraqi raid on the northeastern city of <LOCATION> Tabriz </LOCATION> 330 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> killed at least 10 civilians and wounded 15 others on Sunday. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official news media earlier had reported the warplane raid, as well as another air attack on the central city of <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION>. The raids followed a 2 -LCB- - day lull in Iraqi attacks on Iranian cities during a visit to <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> by Turkish Prime Minister <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also had largely ceased its attacks on <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> cities. Asked whether <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would retaliate for the new raids, <PERSON> Larijani </PERSON> said: `` We will have plenty of surprises for them,'' but made it plain that these would come chiefly in the battlefield through `` punitive offensives.'' `` These offensives will stop them definitely, and they will pay a high price,'' he told a news conference attended by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> periodically allows Western reporters to travel to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. He also said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has `` anything that is needed'' to prevent the Iraqis from using chemical weapons against Iranian cities. He did not elaborate. For just over a month <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has been pounding the Iranian capital with <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> missiles, which it says were made in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Western analysts say they are Soviet-made Scud-Bs with boosters to give them extra range to travel the 290 miles to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Larijani </PERSON>, who is a deputy foreign minister for economic and international relations, is to meet on Wednesday with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> as part of international efforts to end the 7 -LCB- - year-old war He said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would continue these discussions in a `` cooperative mood'' but reiterated <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s demand for a condemnation of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> as the aggressor in the war. `` We are insisting that <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> be held accountable for ... a long list of criminal actions,'' he said. `` We are going to ask for every bit of our rights.'' In an earlier meeting with Western reporters, <PERSON> Kamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Kharrazi </PERSON>, director-general of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s War Information Headquarters, said said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Val-Fajr-10 offensive in mountainous northeastern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had achieved its objectives and ended after winning control of about 390 square miles of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> territory. A Western diplomatic source said he understood that the Iraqis had began a counteroffensive with the aim of recapturing the town of <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION>. Iraqi reportedly attacked <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION> with chemical weapons after <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> took it in March. A visit to the <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION> area for Western newsmen, which had been scheduled for Monday, was put off without explanation. No new date was given. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claims 5,000 Kurds were killed and another 5,000 injured in the chemical attacks March 16-17. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons, but also has stressed it is ready to use any weapons at its disposal to defend Iraqi soil.

 Anti-communist Afghan rebel leaders say the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has stopped supplying Stinger anti-aircraft missiles to the guerrillas in apparent anticipation of a settlement of the Afghan civil war. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, arriving Sunday in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to confer with Afghan government leaders, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> were blocking talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> aimed at ending the eight-year war. <PERSON> Mohamad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamadi </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Harekat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islami </ORGANIZATION>, one of the seven guerrilla groups fighting communist forces in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, said the rebels have not been receiving the shoulder-launched missiles for the last four or five months. `` We are extremely worried,'' <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamadi </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a weekend interview at his headquarters in the Pakistani border city of <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>. `` We do n't trust the Russians. We are afraid because they are deceitful and sly,'' he said, referring to Soviet claims that they want to withdraw their estimated 115,000 troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. However, two other guerrilla leaders said the supply of Stingers had not stopped. The official Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said in a commentary that peace could be brought to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> without <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agreement on a plan to settle the war. The commentary indicates that the Kremlin may be willing to sign a settlement in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> without <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> assurances that it will stop shipping weapons to Afghan rebels. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has said it will halt military aid to the rebels only when the Soviets stop aiding the communist government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Soviet officials contend that economic and military assistance to the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> government is a bilateral matter outside the scope of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> peace talks. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> that his discussions with Afghan President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> would center on the problems delaying an end to the war. `` Unfortunately, serious difficulties have developed at these talks because of the non-constructive position taken by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' the 60-year-old foreign minister said, according to <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> talks recessed Thursday for the Easter holiday and were to resume Monday. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> represents the rebels in the talks. Soviet officials had placed high hopes on getting a peace agreement out of the current round of negotiations that began March 2. But the talks have stalled over the question of foreign military assistance to the two sides. Soviet troops entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to help the communist government battle the insurgents. Western analysts say at least 10,000 Soviet soldiers have been killed in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and more than 20,000 wounded. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> offered in February to begin the pullout on May 15 if the settlement plan was signed by March 15. That informal deadline was surpassed when new issues arose at the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported last week that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government intended to stop supplying the rebels with Stingers, which are said to have dramatically improved the guerrilla's air defenses since they first acquired the deadly missiles in late 1986. The newspaper, quoting unidentified diplomatic sources, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was nervous about leaving a large number of the missiles in the hands of Afghan factions that can not be controlled after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ties are cut. Some of the missiles have made their way to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamadi </PERSON> said he assumed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> stopped the missile shipment because of the possible Soviet withdrawal. He said he believed the supplies would resume if the Soviets failed to leave <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Sebghatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mojadeddi </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which is considered moderate, said no halt had been confirmed. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has promised that it will not leave us alone and as long as the Russians help the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government, they will continue helping us,'' <PERSON> Mojaddedi </PERSON> said in an interview. <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilani </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I know that they have not halted the Stingers.'' <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>, whom the guerrillas have chosen to head a rebel interim government in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> if the Soviets leave, said the halt in the Stingers would not deter the guerrillas from battling the communists. `` We never asked for Stingers,'' he said. `` This was their decision. When we did n't have the Stingers, we -LRB- still -RRB- were fighting and shooting down enemy planes.'' <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalis </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Hezbi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islami </ORGANIZATION> rebel group, declined to confirm that the supply of Stingers had been halted. But he charged the Americans were helping the rebels only to serve their own interests. `` We never stretched our hands out to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> for military help,'' <LOCATION> Khalis </LOCATION> said. <LOCATION> Khalis </LOCATION> said that even without <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid the rebels `` will continue their battle.''

 A Soviet customs inspector became suspicious of an African couple because of their roundabout travel route and found $ 10 million worth of heroin packed inside their suitcases, a newspaper said Sunday.

<HEAD>Federal Court Ruling Threatens Walking Horse Shows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CONNIE CASS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After high-stepping past allegations of cruelty and abuse for over three decades, the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> walking horse industry may be stopped in its tracks by a federal court ruling, officials say. Based on the decision of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> district judge, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> banned the stacked shoes and limited the weight of leg chains used to give the show horses their flamboyant stride. The move has crippled the walking horse industry, said <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> <PERSON> Motes </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Walking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trainers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which plans to help fight the court decision. `` We're trying to save our breed,'' Motes said. Several shows in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> have been canceled since the regulations were announced two weeks ago, and things look grim for the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Walking Horse National Celebration. The annual 10-day show, scheduled for late this summer in <LOCATION> Shelbyville </LOCATION>, typically attracts more than 2,000 horses from across the country and is considered the World Series of the breed. `` I do n't think the celebration could go this year,'' said <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>, an animal scientist with the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Extension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> ordered the new regulations in a suit filed by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> against the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The rules forbid the use of bracelet-like chains weighing more than 6 ounces and padded shoes for racking and walking horses. Chains of up to 10 ounces and stacked shoes 4 inches high had been allowed. The special shoes and chains are needed to keep the walking horse industry on its feet, proponents say. A horse on stacked shoes `` gives a better show ... That old horse really gets into it,'' said <PERSON> Reese </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, spokesman of Friends of the Show Horse. But animal protection activists say chains can cause soreness and swelling of the leg and that padded shoes, which cover the horses' hooves, help hide sores. They also can hide objects that are placed between the horses' hooves and the shoes to cause the animals pain, said <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaspar </PERSON>, general counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Many in the industry say they are being penalized for abuses long since corrected, including the use of chemical irritants in the 1960s. Irritants placed above the hoof combined with chains to make horses lift their feet up and out in a flamboyant gait called the `` big lick,'' but they also gave the animals raw sores. Their widespread use helped push <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pass the Horse Protection Act of 1970, which banned irritants and other soring practices and prompted the industry to form an elaborate inspection system for each show. Motes said the industry is n't causing sores now and added that 98 percent of horses inspected over the past five years have passed. Nevertheless, the judge ruled that horse protection group had raised doubts about the accuracy of show inspections in the suit. <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said the department on Friday asked <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> whether the industry could keep using the devices while the department sets final rules, which could take two months or more. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, whose organization has raised over $ 400,000 and hired lawyers to fight the court decision, said industry groups do not know yet exactly how they will fight the decision, but they expect to challenge it in court. <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> estimates the state's economy would lose about $ 140 million in one year if walking horse shows were wiped out. There are about 500 shows in the state each year, mostly to benefit charities, he said. `` The walking horse is the only show horse that really attracts people, they're exciting,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` We have a special horse. And we're treated special _ especially bad.''

 A diesel oil spill disappeared Sunday from the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> as mysteriously as it had appeared, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. `` We ca n't find a trace of it,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosher </PERSON>, who was part of a team that conducted a land search along a 50-mile stretch of the river from <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, where the slick was spotted Saturday. <PERSON> Mosher </PERSON> said the oil seen the previous day was light and tends to evaporate. The search team checked out banks on both sides of the river and `` nothing was found. We still do n't know where the slick originated,'' <PERSON> Mosher </PERSON> said. Barges, towboats and holding tanks had been checked but provided no clues, he said. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Louisville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said powdered activated carbon was added to the treatment process as a precaution but that no problems were expected with the water supply.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says he will criticize fellow Democratic hopeful <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on occasion, but refrained from doing so on Sunday. He also said no one knows whether <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is could win against Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> argued that the voters are not interested in fellow Democrat <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s criticisms of himself and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, and rejected suggestions that criticism of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would help indicate what his own values are. `` Why is that a test of one's presidential qualities?'' he asked reporters outside of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constantine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> here. `` I disagree with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> ... and I have expressed those disagreements and will in the future. But I do n't think the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people have the slightest interest in what <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> thinks of him or of me,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator, criticized <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> sharply last week on foreign policy and experience. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> hesitated to do the same, but said there are several areas in which he and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> have policy disagreements. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor visited three churches on Easter Sunday, before picking up his campaigning for votes in Tuesday's <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> primary He dropped in on services at an all-black church and served fish and fries at a Sunday supper. He also attended services at Annuciation Greek Orthodox church, which was celebrating Palm Sunday under his church's calendar. Then <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> flew to a farm in northern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> before wrapping up his day in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>. The Democratic hopeful was pressed on his judgment of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s electability, a matter of concern to many Democratic leaders The two men are locked in a tight race in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. Asked if either he or <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> could beat <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, he answered: `` Yes, but I think I have best chance of doing so ... I think <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is beatable. I'd like to be able to run against him.'' Then <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was asked if he disagrees with Democrats who say <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is unelectable in November. `` I do n't think there is any way of telling, based on what we have seen over the past year ... there are no sure things,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. Asked about the subject again later, he said, `` I make no predictions.'' `` I do think I'm the strongest candidate against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. I think I can take the fight to him. I think I can build a very broad coalition with people ... who want somebody who has the skill and the ability and the experience to do this job, who has balanced budgets ... who has a record. That's my strength in this race. `` In the last analysis, what we want is a victory,'' he added. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is leading in the latest polls in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, but he said that is meaningless. `` I do n't pay attention to polls. There were all kinds of polls in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> that said I was ahead. It's on Tuesday that the people of this state will decide who will be the strongest nominee and best president,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> beat <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 2-1 in the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> caucuses on March 26 after <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was leading in the polls there. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he was going to continue to emphasize his positive message and avoid attacks on other candidates unless he is first attacked. He said that approach is working for both him and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` I think it is significant that the two of us who are positive and hopeful and optimistic about this country are also leading in this race,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> mentioned three disagreements with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>: <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> policy, oil import fees and how to provide health insurance for all Americans.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, launching a fresh <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace venture, told <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> Sunday night to act on his plan for negotiations for Palestinian self-rule. `` Negotiations work,'' he said in a strong arrival statement. `` The time to act on it is now.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> must be included in the talks and negotiations must be based on a 1967 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> resolution that calls on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to give up territory in exchange for Arab recognition. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> acknowledged that the plan he presented last month to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders on a swing through the region was difficult for everyone. But he said that `` the balance in our approach is evident'' and that picking on objectionable parts `` is to take a road labeled delay and frustration.'' His message was intended for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who on a trip to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in mid-March condemned <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s call for an international peace conference <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, quoting from <LOCATION> Ecclesiastes </LOCATION>, said there is `` a time of war and time of peace.'' He said: `` This is the time and the season to move decisively towards peace.'' The conference would be held this month as a way of launching negotiations on May 1 to provide some self-rule for the 1.5 million Palestinian Arabs on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> objected that it could provide an active and meddlesome role for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, who usually back <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> positions and broke diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> 21 years ago. On a tour of the troubled <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> again took a stiff stand Sunday. He said he expected no breakthrough in his talks with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> that begin Monday. He again dismissed the conference proposal, saying <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> should explain to him why direct talks are not possible without such a multi-party meeting. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would deal in the negotiations with a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation to work out a three-year interim arrangement for the occupied areas. Meanwhile, negotiations on the overall settlement of the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict would begin in December. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, who favors the approach, greeted <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and his wife enthusiastically at the <LOCATION> Ben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gurion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. Adressing them as `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> invited them to join in this Passover season in prayers for peace. `` We shall pray, knowing there is no easy way to peace. The obstacles are so many and the light so dim,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said. But he said, `` it is our duty to provide a green light.'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was still looking for Palestinians to agree to enter the process. `` Stones are not messages and messages do not need the threat of stones,'' he said, referring to the four months of anti-Israeli protests which have claimed the lives of 136 Palestinians and one <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier.

<HEAD>Starling Advocate Takes Flak For Defense Of Maligned Bird</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Spreyer </PERSON> does n't mind when people say his job is for the birds. Even his business cards read: `` <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Spreyer </PERSON>, the naturalist nobody likes, defending the species nobody wants. Starlings my speciality.'' Spreyer never meant to become an advocate for one of the nation's least-liked birds, but the 31-year-old ornithologist for the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> thinks they're getting a bad rap as messy invaders who take over other birds' turf. He recently delivered a lecture titled `` In Defense of Starlings'' before the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, and he has also spoken on the birds' behalf in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. He even has one for a pet. <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Starling </PERSON> shares <PERSON> Spreyer </PERSON>'s suburban <LOCATION> Barrington </LOCATION> apartment, has learned to talk and has been known to fly to the telephone when it rings and get the receiver off the hook Some of <PERSON> Spreyer </PERSON>'s enthusiasm has caught on, according to a local veterinarian, <PERSON> Peregrine </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON>, interviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> recently after encountering <PERSON> Spreyer </PERSON>'s pet. `` My opinion of starlings was not very high before I met this bird,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON>, who said <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> imitated <PERSON> Spreyer </PERSON>'s telephone bell and answering-machine beep, and then in a Hitchcockian twist, said clearly, `` This is <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Spreyer </PERSON>.'' Starlings are related to talking myna birds, and <PERSON> Spreyer </PERSON> said Sunday their talent as mimics helped them wing their way into his heart. `` I'm embarrassed to admit it now, but eight years ago, I used to consider them as owl food,'' said <PERSON> Spreyer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Spreyer </PERSON> became better acquainted with starlings two years ago while preparing for a lecture on urban wildlife, which includes other European imports such as house sparrows and pigeons. `` People are trained to think all introduced things are bad and all native things are good,'' Spreyer said Sunday. `` I've come to realize that we have to deal with the environment as it is today.'' Starlings, which often gather in large, noisy flocks, have gotten an undeservedly bad reputation as mess-makers and nuisances, while their good points are overlooked, he said. The black songbirds use a completely different food source than other birds, he said. While most birds have strong squeezing muscles in their beaks to enable them to crack nuts, for example, starlings have mighty muscles for prying things open, adapting them perfectly for digging up cutworms and other pests. Groundskeepers at some golf courses welcome starlings, which reduce the need for pesticides, <PERSON> Spreyer </PERSON> said. `` There are plenty of other birds that make a mess,'' and the starling's reputation for displacing native birds with aggressive nesting habits is overblown, he said. Some critics remain unconvinced, including <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogden </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> director of animal-damage control for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. `` They've gotten a bad rap because they're bad birds,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` I ca n't believe anybody would be talking up starlings after all the damage they've caused. ... I know <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>, I like him, but he does n't have to deal with them every day like I do. They give me fits.'' <PERSON> Ogden </PERSON> said crews have been pruning trees around the old state Capitol in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> to evict non-native starlings whose droppings made a `` teetotal mess.''

<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> preached Easter sermons to huge white, black and Hispanic crowds Sunday, invoking the memory of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and declaring, `` Hope has been unleashed.'' `` There is a sense of hope and renewal in the air,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told a largely Hispanic Catholic congregation where hundreds stood outside. `` Not an Easter of eggs and rabbits and ruffled dresses, but an Easter of authentic hope and renewal _ shaking of shackles.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> repeatedly referred to the crucifixion of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> and compared his death to that of King, the civil rights leader slain 20 years ago Monday in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>. `` Dr. <PERSON> King </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> ... Government set the climates for their killings,'' he said. `` ... Dr. <PERSON> King </PERSON> got in trouble with our government for ending apartheid.'' He compared the crucifixion as well to the suffering of the poor, and used the symbolism of Easter and the resurrection in describing the end of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s administration. `` The real Easter is going on,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` ... We survived seven years of midnight.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was campaigning a second day in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, where Democrats express a choice for president in statewide caucuses Monday night that will apportion 45 delegates. As <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was met with large, enthusiastic crowds, his campaign manager, <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, said in a TV interview that the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> forces are ready for the closer scrutiny that comes with a candidate's emergence as a frontrunner. `` What <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has done during the course of the last four or five months ... people have not paid close attention to him, have not asked him whole lots of questions _ he's been in a position where he is really prepared his answers. He's prepared himself to respond to any questions put to him,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>'' program. `` <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is smart. He has observed, and he is ready to be looked at really closely, far more closely than he has been looked at in the past.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> also said that `` There is a new <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>,'' who has shown ` ` phenomenal growth'' since his 1984 campaign <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on Sunday spoke at <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s predominantly white <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, where a joint service was held with the predominantly black Shorter African <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. Some 1,500 people crowded the church and watched on television from the basement, and at least as many stood outside in the warm sun, listening on loudspeakers. He then went to Our Lady of <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION> Catholic church in a predominantly Hispanic, working class neighborhood. The church was jammed and hundreds lined up for a block - a half-dozen deep - to catch a glimpse of the candidate. <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> sat with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at the Catholic church. `` Why are so many people here today?'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> asked the congregation. `` Because hope has been let loose.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was met with similarly large and enthusiastic crowds Saturday in three other <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> cities, including the affluent ski resort <LOCATION> Aspen </LOCATION>. `` I sense, as I travel around the nation, something is going on,'' he said at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` There are several thousand people outdoors. Something is going on. ... From <LOCATION> Aspen </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, something is going on.'' Sitting in the front row was <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> senator who dropped out of the presidential race, accompanied by his wife <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and daughter <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON>. Neither <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> has endorsed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Reading one of the Old Testament lessons at the first church was the state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Buie </PERSON> <PERSON> Seawell </PERSON>, who is backing <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> against <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for the Democratic presidential nomination. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> delivered sermons heavy with biblical references, but blended with it political references to himself and criticism of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The congregations responded with shouts and applause. One of his standard political lines got applause at the Catholic church. `` I would rather have Roosevelt in a wheelchair than <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on a horse,'' he said.

<HEAD>Cardinal Calls for Definitive Truce in Civil War</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> prayed Sunday during the Easter Mass for a definitive truce in the 6 -LCB- - year-old civil war and a `` passage from war to life. The Roman Catholic prelate also announced, after speaking with representatives of the government and rebels, that peace talks scheduled to open Wednesday in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> had been postponed until April 12. A 60-day cease-fire signed March 23 went into effect Friday and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday there were no reports of violations. The rebels' Nicaraguan Resistance alliance on Saturday insisted the meeting set for Wednesday be postponed for a week, saying technical talks to work out the mechanics for the cease-fire had net been resolved. <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> <PERSON> y </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON>, who is an observer at the peace negotiations, told the nearly 300 people who attended Mass at the small <ORGANIZATION> Las </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sierritas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> that the one-week delay of the talks is `` sad for our people.'' He told the worshipers the new round of peace talks had been delayed because the rebels, known as Contras, said the Sandinista government had not complied with the plan signed by both sides at meetings last month in the border outpost of <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>. But the cardinal said he is satisfied with the progress in the negotiations and `` I have a lot of hope on this Easter Sunday.'' `` Enough of death, a step toward life,'' he said as members of the congregation applauded and cheered. Military officers from the government and Nicaraguan Resistance met March 28-29 in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> and agreed to set up five zones in which the Contra combatants would gather as part of the truce. They did not, however, establish in detail the zones or security measure for the rebels. Contra leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said Saturday night in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>: `` We are living up to the accord. However the reason we asked for a delay in the talks is that the zones have yet to be established and there are many details.'' The rebels also said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> had not freed all the prisoners requested by the Contras when the government released 100 political prisoners March 29. The cease-fire plan calls for the gradual release of 3,300 political prisoners. In another complaint, the Contras said the government had violated the provision of the plan that provides for unrestricted freedom of expression by withholding newsprint to the opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>. Newsprint, like other imported items, is in short supply. <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prensa </LOCATION>, in its March 26 edition, said it would not publish during Holy Week. Pro-government newspapers also have n't published papers since Wednesday because of the holidays. <PERSON> Horacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> editor, said Sunday the paper would publish Monday with stockpiled paper. Government offices and most businesses and restaurants have been closed since Wednesday afternoon. Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON>, in a Friday-dated letter to <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Aristides </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, said it was `` extremely important to follow the outline of the cease-fire plan,'' referring to the talks that had been scheduled for Wednesday. <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> blamed the Contras for the lack of progress during the technical meetings, saying the rebel delegation arrived late on the first day and insisted on ending the talks promptly at 5 p.m. on the second day. The two sides planned to hold another round of technical negotiations starting Tuesday at <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, 90 miles south of the capital on the border with <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. Under the truce plan, Contra combatants are to move into designated zones during the first two weeks of April. There would be a second release of political prisoners after it was verified the rebels were in the zones.

<HEAD>Milwaukee Chooses Next Mayor After Maier's Long Reign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Voters on Tuesday will choose a fresh face to occupy the mayor's office in a closely contested race that marks the end of incumbent Mayor <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Maier </PERSON>'s reign of nearly three decades. <PERSON> Maier </PERSON> has held his office since 1960, longer than any other big-city mayor in the country. The 70-year-old <PERSON> Maier </PERSON> cited his age as reason for not running for another term. The two contenders vying for his job are state Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON>, 38, and former acting Gov. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON>, 48. The race is non-partisan; both contenders have run for other offices in the past as Democrats. When the campaign began, polls put <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON> well behind. But his support grew, and he finished 4 percentage points behind <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON> in the February primary. Recent polls put the race a dead heat. During <PERSON> Maier </PERSON>'s tenure, the city enjoyed a downtown renaissance but suffered from lingering racial divisions, and his performance received mixed reviews from the two candidates. `` The good thing about him is that he's strong and he makes decisions and deep down inside he cares deeply about the city,'' <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON> said. `` -LRB- But -RRB- he had trouble dealing with his enemies, dealing with his critics. I think <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> would take criticism too much as a personal criticism.'' <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON>, meanwhile, said <PERSON> Maier </PERSON> `` has established an excellent foundation on which we can build.'' Both candidates praised the downtown revitalization, but they noted more attention should go toward the inner-city neighborhoods, which hold the potentially key black vote. About one-fourth of the city's 600,000 residents are black. <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON> won the endorsement of a black convention organized by the third-place finisher in the mayoral primary, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON>. <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON> boycotted the event, objecting to a $ 20 admission fee charged by <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON> to help retire his campaign debt. But <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON> may be able to draw on support from key members of the black community, including <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> and state Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>. `` The biggest single economic problem that we have is the high black unemployment rate,'' <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON> said. The federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> reported in 1985 that black unemployment in the <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> metropolitan area was about 28 percent. The race between <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON> has centered as much on their personalities as it has on the issues, where the two candidates often sound similar. <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON> cultivated an image of being a likable candidate who, as mayor, would bring together different factions to address the city's problems and promote harmony. But he is criticized for trying to please too many people and making promises on issues without having all the facts. For example, <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON> won the endorsement of the primary's fourth-place finisher, <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, when he announced support of her proposed development programs for neighborhoods But he then was unable to answer certain questions about the plan, and afterward he backed off his position, saying he would promise to study the ideas. `` I am not a hotshot and I do n't have all the answers,'' <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON> said. `` All of my strengths and all of my successes have been brought about by getting people around the table and talking about an issue and then developing a plan.'' <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON> portrayed himself as a take-charge candidate who offers detailed programs. But he has been criticized for being too strident, which <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON> insists proves his opponent's `` instability. While <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON> says he has tried to tone down emotions, he adds: `` A mayor ought to be able to get angry, especially when it's something that affects the city. <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON> was elected lieutenant governor 1970 after eight years in the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. He became acting governor in 1977 when Gov. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucey </PERSON> resigned to become ambassador to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. But the following year, <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON> lost the general election for a full term as governor to his Republican challenger. <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON>, at 6-foot-7 nearly a foot taller than <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON>, served in the state Assembly from 1974 to 1982, when he was elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.

 Iraqi troops killed 400 Kurdish civilians who had been injured in a chemical-bomb attack and were trying to reach a hospital, a Kurdish guerrilla leader said Sunday. The report could not be independently confirmed. Neither <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> nor <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which backs the Iraqi Kurdish separatists, had immediate comment. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, meanwhile, said its warplanes raided two Iranian refineries Sunday but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said the bombs hit residential areas, killing 10 civilians and wounding 50. In <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, a senior official told reporters <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would respond to the renewed attacks on his nation's cities with ground offensives. Kurdish guerrilla leader <PERSON> Jalal </PERSON> <PERSON> Talabani </PERSON> said the 400 civilians from the mountainous <LOCATION> Qara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dagh </LOCATION> district were wounded in an Iraqi chemical raid. <PERSON> Talabani </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kurdistan </ORGANIZATION>, said the wounded were traveling to a hospital in the northeastern city of <LOCATION> Sulaymaniyah </LOCATION> when they were taken prisoner by <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> soldiers and killed on Saturday. <PERSON> Talabani </PERSON> is in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and made the accusation in a telephoned statement. Kurdish separatists have been fighting the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> government for decades for an independent homeland. <LOCATION> Qara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dagh </LOCATION> is 20 miles west of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Darbandikhan </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claims Iraqi chemical bombings March 16-17 killed 5,000 civilians and injured many more. A senior <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> official on Sunday repeated the claim that <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> is biased toward <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Akram </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Witri </PERSON>, chief of the legal department at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference, `` We have been patient but now we are fed up with <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> and other top <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials who are appeasing <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for their self interest.'' Last week <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> expressed `` bitterness and disappointment at the biased and ill-balanced nature'' of recent statements by <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> on the alleged use of chemical weapons by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Al-Witri accused <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> of neglecting the fate of Iraqi prisoners of war. `` Our 45,000 POWs in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> are subject to all kinds of physical and psychological torture and other methods of maltreatment and it is time'' that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> investigate, he said. It was the first time <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is holding 45,000 war prisoners. Also Sunday, an Iranian military spokesman for the first time listed an overall casualty toll in just over a month of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> air and missile attacks on Iranian cities _ 1,145 dead and 4,000 wounded. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has said hundreds of its civilians have been killed in similar raids. The latest attacks, which were among 140 warplane combat missions reported by the <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> during the day, signaled a rekindling of the `` war of the cities'' after a 2 -LCB- - day break <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> anounced its forces sank six Iranian gunboats during the night as they attempted to approach an offshore oil platform in the northern <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> denied the claim. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted a military communique as saying the strikes on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s refineries near the cities of <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tabriz </LOCATION> were carried out at 2:40 p.m.. That was about six hours after Turkish Prime Minister <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> left the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> had ceased its attacks on Iranian cities during <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>'s visit and had announced it would not resume attacks for six hours after <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> left. In <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Kharrazi </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Headquarters </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters that 10 people were killed in <LOCATION> Tabriz </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- said another 50 were wounded. The Iranian agency said anti-aircraft batteries shot down one of the warplanes at <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION> `` seconds after the attack'' on the city. It said the pilot, <PERSON> Talal </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON>, no rank given, was taken prisoner by Iranian forces. An <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> military communique said an Iraqi plane `` crashed inside enemy territory.'' Asked whether <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would retaliate for Sunday's raids, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Javad </PERSON> <PERSON> Larijani </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>: `` We will have plenty of surprises for them,'' but they would be mainly on the battlefield through `` punitive offensives.'' `` These offensives will stop them definitely, and they will pay a high price,'' he said. Turkish sources said <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>, who arrived in <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION> later Sunday, had proposed that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> call a cease-fire in the `` war of the cities,'' which began Feb. 29. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> said in a departure statement that <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> is trying to help the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> end the 7 -LCB- - year-old war between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Headquarters </ORGANIZATION> as denying <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s claims that it trounced <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and its Kurdish separatist allies in fighting last week in mountainous northeastern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said Saturday that its forces killed thousands of Iranians and overran Kurdish guerrilla bases, scoring a major victory and recapturing tracts of Iraqi soil. The Iranian spokesman said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was `` in full control'' of all the towns and strategic heights captured during an offensive that began in mid-March. A senior <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> envoy, meanwhile, arrived in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> carrying a message from President <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiannian </PERSON> to King Fahd dealing with the Iran-Iraq war, the official <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. It said Chinese Vice Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qi </PERSON> <PERSON> Huaiyuan </PERSON> handed the written message to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> Foreign Minister Prince <PERSON> Saud </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Faisal </PERSON>. The contents were not disclosed. Last month <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> confirmed it was buying Chinese intermediate-range missiles. According to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials, the deal involved CSS-2 missiles with a range of 1,850 miles.

 Iraqi troops seized 400 civilians who had been wounded by chemical weapons and were en route to a hospital, then massacred them at a military camp, a Kurdish guerrilla leader said Sunday. <PERSON> Jalal </PERSON> <PERSON> Talabani </PERSON> said the civilians from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Qara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dagh </LOCATION> district were wounded in a recent Iraqi chemical-bomb attack. The predominantly Kurdish district is in a mountainous border region that has been the scene of fierce fighting <PERSON> Talabani </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kurdistan </ORGANIZATION>, said the wounded were traveling to a hospital in the northeastern city of <LOCATION> Sulaymaniyah </LOCATION> when they were taken prisoner by <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> soldiers. They were forced to go to to the nearby <LOCATION> Tanjero </LOCATION> military camp where they were all killed on Saturday, he said. <PERSON> Talabani </PERSON>, who is in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and made the accusation in a telephoned statement, said he did not know what weapons were used to kill the prisoners. The report could not be independently confirmed. Neither <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> nor <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which backs the Iraqi Kurdish separatists, had an immediate comment. <PERSON> Talabani </PERSON> also said there were no Iranian troops in the <LOCATION> Qara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dagh </LOCATION> region, and it was controlled by Kurdish separatists. <PERSON> Qara </PERSON> <PERSON> Dagh </PERSON> is about 20 miles west of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Darbandikhan </LOCATION>, where Iranian Revolutionary Guards have seized <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> territory in an offensive that began in mid-March. Kurdish separatists have repeatedly claimed the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> government is waging a campaign of genocide against the Kurds. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, at war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> since September 1980, has come under international criticism for using chemical weapons in the fighting. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claims Iraqi chemical bombings March 16-17 in the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Darbandikhan </LOCATION> area killed 5,000 civilians and injured many more.

 A pet pig named Chop Chop has become the animal kingdom's surfing champion, doing a porcine version of a `` hang ten'' as he rode through the waves with his owner and garnering a perfect score. A dozen surfers paired up with dogs, geese and even fish in an aquarium Saturday at the `` Wet Pet'' exhibition at the <ORGANIZATION> Rell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Menehune </ORGANIZATION> Surfing Championships.

 An <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> was electrocuted Sunday when <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers forced him to climb a utility poll to remove a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flag in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in one of three deaths in the occupied territories, the army said. It reported another <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> was electrocuted while trying to attach a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flag to a power line in <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION>, also in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Arab reporters said the man was shot by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, arriving on a new <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace shuttle, told <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to act on his plan for negotiations for Palestinian self-rule. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> announced a new army policy to go on the offensive and teach rioting Arabs a lesson. Sunday's deaths brought to 136 the number of Arabs who have died in four months of protests against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures. One Israeli soldier has been killed. The months of rioting cast a pall on Christian celebrations of Easter. About 1,000 worshipers, half of last year's number, attended services in the 12th century Church of the Holy Sepulcher, marking the site where Christians believe <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> rose from the dead after being crucified. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> must be included in peace talks and negotiations must be based on a 1967 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> resolution that calls on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to give up territory in exchange for Arab recognition. `` For everything there is a season ... a time to love and a time to hate; a time for war and a time for peace,'' he said. `` This is the time and the season to move decisively towards peace.'' His remarks appeared aimed primarily at Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who told reporters during a visit to a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> settlement Sunday that <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had yet to convince him of the need for an international peace conference. The American peace proposal calls for an international conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Under the proposal <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would give land to the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> in exchange for peace. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s third <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> shuttle since October began after a sharp escalation of bloodshed in the past week in which 20 Arabs were killed and scores more shot by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. Visiting the site in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> where soldiers shot three Arabs to death on Saturday, <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> explained a new tactic the army was using to take the initiative away from the Arab demonstrators. `` In the majority of the incidents,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said about the recent bloodshed, `` the confrontations were the result of our initiative, part of an effort to ensure a calming of the situation and to suppress the violence.'' Army spokesmen said soldiers would no longer ignore, as they had in the past, demonstrations in remote villages or other locations that did not interfere with traffic or endanger lives. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Ramallah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said a 40-year-old <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Diab </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> died Sunday of a neck wound suffered during Land Day protests March 30 in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village <LOCATION> Yatta </LOCATION>. The army said <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamzawy </PERSON>, 18, was electrocuted when soldiers ordered him to climb a utility pole and remove a flag in the Askar refugee camp near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. The army also said a 20-year-old <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> man was electrocuted while trying to attach an outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flag to a power line in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> journalists said soldiers shot the youth. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> did not include the <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> death in its toll. <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Saad </PERSON> <PERSON> Eddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Alami </PERSON>, the 77-year-old mufti, or Moslem leader, of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said he suffered heart problems after an Israeli policeman struck him Friday as he sought permission to allow TV cameramen into the <LOCATION> Al </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aqsa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mosque </LOCATION> area. Police spokesman <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapidot </PERSON> described <PERSON> Alami </PERSON>'s claims as `` a big lie from start to end.'' In a leaflet last week, underground leaders called for a general strike in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> on Monday to protest the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> visit. They demanded that Palestinians avoid meeting <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> during his visit. Speaking to reporters in the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military settlement of <LOCATION> Ginat </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> predicted arranging peace talks would be a lengthy process. `` I'm skeptical about all the prophecies that the talks will have some kind of result, a breakthrough,'' said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who called for <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to concentrate on the substance of a settlement and not the logistics of starting negotiations.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> detonated an underground nuclear blast Sunday in the republic of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>, the third such test announced by the Soviets this year, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. It said the blast had a yield of 20 to 150 kilotons. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> atom bomb dropped on <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, on Aug. 6, 1945, had a yield of 20 kilotons, or the equivalent of 20,000 tons of TNT.

 Police watched over Easter Sunday services in the city's impoverished south-central neighborhoods, attempting to reassure churchgoers shocked by a Good Friday street gang shooting that ranked among the city's worst. `` The decent people in the community have a right to see us around every once in a while,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Davenport </PERSON>, adding that his officers were ordered to make their presence known near churches. `` I'm pleased,'' said <PERSON> Osmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindo </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Square </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, when he heard two officers had parked out front and looked in briefly on his service. `` We need to let the thugs in our city know they can not dominate our city.'' Most people leaving the service said they had n't noticed the officers but many in the largely minority neighborhood said the offical concern about continuing gang violence was long overdue. `` This stuff is going on every day,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON>, 58, whose son <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON>, 19, was recovering from seven bullet wounds suffered in the shooting. `` Any day is a Good Friday when people can walk the streets, sit on their porch,'' said <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON>, adding his son, like most of those wounded, was n't associated with gangs. At <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brigid </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> near the scene of the shootings, the Rev. <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauwens </PERSON> welcomed the police interest, but urged worshipers to seek solace in God. He held up the example of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' disciples, who spread the message of Christianity despite fear of death at the hands of unbelievers. The police deployment followed an overnight sweep by a task force of more than 300 officers seeking to intimidate gang members and forestall retaliation for the Friday night shooting, which killed one man and injured 12 other people, one of them a 4-year-old boy. The killers, who gunned down rival gang members and innocent bystanders alike from a passing car, remained at large Sunday. Police who participated in the overnight sweep arrested 175 people for investigation of a variety of alleged offenses and interrogated 619 people, about 500 of them believed to be gang members, said Detective <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Celli </PERSON>. The stepped-up police presence around churches Sunday was accomplished without extra manpower, though Police Chief <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> on Saturday reiterated an oft-repeated promise to declare war on the gangs, blamed for nearly 400 killings in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> last year. Officers were ordered to show the flag around services as much as possible in the course of their regular duties. <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said Saturday he would redeploy his force to boost the number of officers on south-central streets from 200 to 1,000. He did n't say when the redeployment, to be accomplished by putting officers on overtime, would begin. Police said the Good Friday shootings may have been the city's worst in terms of the number of total casualties In 1984, five people were killed and five others injured in a gang shooting at a party outside a home. For residents of the gang-plagued area, `` drive-by'' shootings such as Friday's are chillingly commonplace. `` This is nothing new for any of us,'' said <PERSON> Bauwens </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigid </ORGANIZATION>, who heard the gunshots from his room in the rectory. `` Everybody here lives in a certain amount of fear,'' <PERSON> Bauwens </PERSON> said. `` I must have done half a dozen funerals in the past year or two for teen-agers, all boys, who are victims of gangs.'' Most of the wounded were not associated with gangs, but were standing and talking on a sidewalk in an area claimed as drug-sales territory by five or six gangs, police said. The 4-year-old who was wounded, <PERSON> Dashawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Holly </PERSON>, was reported in fair condition Sunday at County-USC Medical Center.

 <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> leaders praised <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> as the resurrected son of God to close the faith's 158th Annual General Conference Sunday with an Easter theme reaffirming fundamental church doctrine. The gathering closed with a sermon written by President <PERSON> Ezra </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> telling listeners to demonstrate their love for God by obeying his laws. `` I pray that we will be obedient to God, learn his will and do it, and above all, that we will keep the first and great commandment _ to love the Lord with all our heart, soul, mind and strength,'' said the sermon, which was read by <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>, a counselor in the church's ruling First Presidency. <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>'s sermon said Mormons should consider whether they are adhering to the church's principles, such as participating in missionary work, daily Scripture reading, and building family unity with weekly activities. It also stressed the longstanding admonition that church members prepare for possible emergencies by keeping on hand enough food, clothing and other essential supplies to last one year. A church official said the 88-year-old <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> to read the sermon for him because he was tired. Earlier, <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> delivered his own homily saying <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> submitted to crucifixion to make the resurrection of all men and women possible through his own death. Mormon doctrine holds that mankind will be resurrected in perfect, immortal physical bodies before the final judgment. `` Of all the victories of human history, none is so great, none so universal in its effect, none so everlasting in its consequences, as the victory of the crucified Lord who came forth in the resurrection that first Easter morning,'' <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirthlin </PERSON>, a member of the Twelve, a group of clergy that assist the First Presidency, urged Mormons to follow <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> by emulating his honesty, which he said includes paying employees a fair wage, filing accurate tax returns and not padding expense accounts. The leaders spoke as part of a series of 12 sermons capping the two-day conference, in which speakers stressed the church's basic beliefs about <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s resurrection. Critics have accused Mormons of exalting <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who believers say found the church in 1820 after God and <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> appeared to him, to a level equal to or surpassing <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>. But the speakers gave no indication that their remarks were in response to such criticism. The conference, attended by more than 6,000 church members, also was told Saturday that the church attracted a record 227,284 converts during 1987, bringing total membership to 6.5 million.

 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is scheduled to make its largest release of what are believed to be remains of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel missing in action in the Vietnam War that ended with a communist victory in 1975. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military team is to receive the 27 sets of remains on Wednesday at <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Noi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and fly them to the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Identification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> for analysis It would be the fourth turnover since retired Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON>, acting as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s special emissary, reached an agreement in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, the Vietnamese capital, last August that ended months of deadlocked negotiatons on the issue. Positive identifications of the 27 sets of remains would mean substantial progress because <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> has returned only 152 confirmed sets since the war. The two nations often have quarreled over accounting for the 1,767 Americans who remain listed as missing in action in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The largest previous transfer of remains was on Aug. 14, 1985. It involved 26 sets, and at least 24 have been identified as <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> remains. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official closely involved in the issue said recently that while progress since the <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> agreement had not been as rapid as <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had hoped, <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> has been much more responsive to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> requests to investigate reports involving MIAs. The Vietnamese have been discussing the issue with an increasing number of congressmen and other American visitors, many of whom return to urge increased official contacts with <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>. In March, the Vietnamese met with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBoutillier </PERSON>, a former congressman who now heads a private lobbying group that insists there are still Americans being held prisoners in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The MIA issue also is on the agendas of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sens. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.D. </LOCATION>, and G.V. <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, D-Mo., who are separately visiting <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> this week The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said the Vietnamese have indicated they did not believe <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was implementing humanitarian provisions of the <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> agreement. He said the Vietnamese complained that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has only sent exploratory medical teams and encouraged private <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agencies to aid <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s disabled war veterans and other humanitarian cases. `` They're not making a secret that they prefer direct government-to-government aid,'' said the official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> do not have diplomatic relations.

 Afghan President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> on Sunday declared the first day of general elections a national holiday, the government's radio station reported. The elections, scheduled to begin Tuesday, come at a time when negotiations are under way in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> on the withdrawal of an estimated 115,000 Soviet military personnel in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` As proposed by the election commission, the 5th of April will be a national holiday on the occasion of the elections for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> as saying in a decree. One-fourth of the 62 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and 229 House of Deputies seats are to be set aside for rebel candidates, even if they do not participate. The elections are to run until April 14. Most members of the election commission organizing the balloting are from the Marxist government. The guerrillas have refused any power-sharing with the communists and have vowed to fight until they overthrow the government. Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s broadcast of <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s statement was monitored in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>. Leftists in the armed foreces seized power in a coup in April 1978. Soviet troops intervened in December 1979 to help the faltering government battle the guerrillas.

<HEAD>Company Under Fire From Government, Ex-Clients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A company that advertised that it could help businesses secure loans is facing an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation and lawsuits from unhappy ex-clients who paid high fees but never received financing, according to a report published Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> reported that since its founding in 1986, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has collected between $ 2 million and $ 50 million from clients seeking loans. But dozens of clients interviewed by the newspaper reported that they did n't get any loans and were unable to recover their fees. Three ex-clients have sued <ORGANIZATION> FBC </ORGANIZATION> in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, and a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> has indicted the executives of several companies with which FBC works. An <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the agency has launched an investigation of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charter </ORGANIZATION> and several of the companies it deals with. The company is unrelated to the New York-based securities firm, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. FBC President <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> refused to be interviewed, the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> said His associate, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, also refused comment and referred questions to <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Codinha </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> lawyer representing the company. <PERSON> Codinha </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> that after consulting his clients, he decided it was `` not in their interest'' to talk. According to the Globe, FBC works with numerous other companies in arranging loans and loan guarantees. The various companies involved claim to be independent of each other, the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> said, but in fact are linked in some way. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 56, of <LOCATION> Allentown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> he went to FBC when he and a partner were looking for a $ 500,000 loan to set up a charter bus company and saw a newspaper advertisement for FBC. He told the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION> FBC </ORGANIZATION> officials told him that <ORGANIZATION> FBC </ORGANIZATION> did not make loans, but would get him a loan guarantee _ a promise that money he borrowed would be repaid even if the bus company failed. <ORGANIZATION> FBC </ORGANIZATION> also told him that a second company would issue the guarantee. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said that while the second company did not make the actual loan, it would direct him to a third company that would come up with the money. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> told the newspaper that <ORGANIZATION> FBC </ORGANIZATION> executives warned him that there would be risks in the deal. However, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said, by the beginning of 1987, he had paid FBC a $ 20,000 fee, a $ 3,500 fee to a company called <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> for a `` character and credit investigation'' and was making $ 1,000 monthly fee payments to another company in on the deal, <LOCATION> Euro-Shares </LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. Last August, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said, he lost his bus company and he eventually had to sell his car and put his house on the market because of indebtedness. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Showalter </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> manufacturer who sought a $ 1 million loan through a series of companies that involved <ORGANIZATION> FBC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> to produce a line of clothing featuring cartoon characters, told the newspaper a story similar to <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>'. <PERSON> Showalter </PERSON> paid several companies fees totaling $ 42,500 but never received the $ 1 million loan he was seeking, according to the Globe. In a suit filed here, businessman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Stuart </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, contends he and a client of his paid fees totaling $ 70,000 to FBC for help in securing $ 35 million in loans, but never received any financing. One of several European companies to which <ORGANIZATION> FBC </ORGANIZATION> clients are referred, Euro-Kredit, N.A., is owned by <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>, who is under indictment in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> for fraud. <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>'s real name is <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> and he is a convicted bank robber and con man, the newspaper reported. Five other people were also indicted last fall _ two <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> colleagues and three executives of other companies affiliated with <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>, the newspaper said. The various companies are accused of working together to defraud clients, splitting the large fees but failing to provide loans. The newspaper said <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charter </ORGANIZATION> claimed to have growing numbers of satisified customers, but declined to name any of them. According to the Globe, records in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> show that <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> changed his name shortly before arriving in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to set up <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charter </ORGANIZATION> in mid-1986. Before the change, his name was <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Knasel </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Shipbuilders Reject New BIW Contract Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The shipbuilders' union at the Bath Iron Works has rejected a proposed three-year contract that both the company and union had hoped would usher in a new era of labor peace. However, Saturday's vote did not signal authorization for a strike. The 5,500-member union and the company are expected to stick with the existing contract that expires Aug. 14 and re-enter negotiations sometime this summer. <ORGANIZATION> BIW </ORGANIZATION> had invited its unions to open contract talks early, in hopes of improving its competitiveness. It lost four of five <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> cruiser contracts in February to rival <ORGANIZATION> Ingalls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION>. The proposed contract, which offered three annual 2.5 percent wage increases and the phase-out of a two-tier pay system that gives less to new employees, was rejected by a margin of roughly 3 to 2, said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON>, president of Local 6 of the <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and Shipbuilding Workers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. About 2,500 of the union's approximately 5,500 members participated in the voting. `` I feel it should have gone through, because I do n't feel they're going to offer any more in August,'' <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> BIW </ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president, issued a statement saying management officials were `` disappointed with the result but believe the process was constructive and informative.'' `` We do not regret having made the effort,'' <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON> blamed the rejection in part on members' desire for bigger pay hikes and a swifter end to the two-tier wage system. He said he understood rank-and-file sentiments but added, `` the company has n't got any money They opened the books and proved it.'' Under the current contract, newer employees have been paid about $ 3 less an hour than veteran workers. The rejected company proposal would have phased out the two-tier system in April 1990. The proposed 2.5 percent wage increase would have amounted to 29 cents an hour more for first-class mechanics in the first two years of the contract and 30 cents an hour more the final year. Members of Local 7, a much smaller union representing 393 clerical and technical workers, overwhelmingly approved a new three-year contract a week ago. The shipyard, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s largest private employer, reached its highest peacetime employment level last month, reporting 8,900 workers on its payroll.

 Police and troops moved to tighten security along <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s frontier with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> Sunday and three more deaths were blamed on Sikh extremists in northern <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state that borders <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> on Friday ordered increased border security to try to stem the delivery of weapons to the Sikh separatists in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> contends Sikh militants are receiving arms smuggled from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Sikh extremists killed at least 120 people in the week ending Saturday, the highest one-week toll since separatists began a guerrilla war for their own homeland in 1982. Many of the victims were Hindus, but moderate Sikhs also have been slain by the militants. Patrols were stepped up along the Indo-Pakistan border in northern <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> state, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> is south of <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> and east of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Police and paramilitary unit commanders are scheduled to meet Monday in the Sikh holy city of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> to discuss increased security in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. Several Indian newspapers reported Sunday that the government was considering the construction of fences along parts of the Indo-Pakistan border as well as increased patrols. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said two people, who it did not identify, were shot to death in <LOCATION> Gurdaspur </LOCATION> district in separate attacks late Saturday and Sunday. A village leader was killed in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> district Saturday night, the news agency said. He was identified as <PERSON> Nirmal </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a Sikh. The latest killings raised to at least 648 the number of deaths blamed on <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> extremists in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> this year. In 1987, about 1,000 people were slain in violence related to the separatists' campaign. <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> Gov. S.S. Ray on Sunday visited three villages where 28 people were shot to death by Sikh militants last week. He pledged government assistance to the survivors. Eighteen of the victims were Hindus living in a hamlet near the village of <LOCATION> Pangota </LOCATION>, 24 miles north of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. Sikhs, whose religion is an offshoot of <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>, make up only 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million population, but they are a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Five Months After Well Rescue, Celebrity Status Has Ups and Downs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIDLAND, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than five months after <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>'s dramatic rescue from a narrow well gripped the nation, the child and her family continue to grapple with the ups and downs of their celebrity status. The <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> expect their opening-day game Monday to be packed as <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> tosses out the first ball of the season at Arlington Stadium. That was hardly the <ORGANIZATION> McClures </ORGANIZATION>' only offer. `` Later, I got a call from the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astros </ORGANIZATION>,'' said former state Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Snelson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, the family's publicist. He said he turned down the <ORGANIZATION> Astros </ORGANIZATION>' request for <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> because the family did n't have time for their Tuesday opener. Last week, <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> and her mother, <PERSON> Reba </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Cissy </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, traveled to <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to help fund-raising efforts for a 5-year-old boy who faces heart and lung transplants. But not all the attention leveled at the family has been flattering. The <ORGANIZATION> McClures </ORGANIZATION> bought a new three-bedroom tract house in the modest suburb of <LOCATION> Greenwood </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, who turned 19 last week, stays home with <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> while her 18-year-old husband works at a new job selling sporting goods at a local store. But when <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON> brought her television talk show to <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> and sent a limousine to pick up the <ORGANIZATION> McClures </ORGANIZATION>, rumors spread that the couple was living in a large home in an exclusive neighborhood. `` That's when the rumors started flying,'' said M.L. <PERSON> Blevins </PERSON>, accountant for the <ORGANIZATION> McClures </ORGANIZATION>. He dismissed the talk, estimating the value of the <ORGANIZATION> McClures </ORGANIZATION>' new home at between $ 30,000 and $ 40,000. <PERSON> Snelson </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> McClures </ORGANIZATION>' lifestyle has remained relatively Spartan, despite large sums of money placed into a trust fund and forwarded in other donations. But the family's fame remains strong and the notoriety has n't been all bad for a town that had been hit hard by the slump in oil and gas prices `` I got a letter the other day _ a registered letter _ addressed to ` <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON>'s mayor,''' said <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> mayor. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> recently formed a committee to choose the best movie deal about the well rescue and break an impasse between two associations of rescuers pursuing separate agreements. Initially, he said, the rescue `` did a lot to take our minds off the oil business problems. It gave us a chance to think about the fact that there are things just as important -LRB- as -RRB-, if not more important than, money.''

 The presidential candidates took their politicking to Easter church services on Sunday as they battled for victory in this week's campaign double feature _ the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> caucuses and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> primary. Republican <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, whose candidacy is all but derailed by Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s march to the nomination, said he has a mandate from God and wo n't stop until he is president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Saying he would run again in 1992, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> told about 3,000 people at <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Happy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> that `` I am not going to quit ... That is His plan for me and for this nation.'' But with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nomination virtually assured, the 1988 focus is now on the Democrats. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, who has staked hopes of reviving his trailing campaign with a good showing in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> on Tuesday, picked up the endorsement this weekend of the <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>. The newspaper cited <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s `` impressive record'' in arms control, military reform and environmental protection, cand called him `` one of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' best informed members on the future of science and technology.'' <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who shares frontrunner status with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, was asked by reporters outside a <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> church if he shared the view of some Democrats that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is not electable because he his black and too liberal. `` I do n't think there is any way of knowing,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> also sidestepped that question Sunday when interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>'' program. `` We have n't nominated anyone yet,'' he said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will do its best to nominate, I hope, the most electable candidate in order to win in November.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on Sunday showed no concern about reports of consternation among Democrats over his recent momentum. Speaking to overflow crowds at two <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> churches, he continued to hammer home the themes that have brought a burgeoning response to his campaign. At the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, where 1,500 people jammed inside and at least as many listened to him on loudspeakers outside, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said: `` I sense as I travel around the nation something is going on. There are several thousand people outdoors _ something is going on. `` From <LOCATION> Aspen </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> _ something is going on ... Hope has been unleased.'' Later, in a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood, people lined the street for a block to see <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> arrive at Our Lady of <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION> Catholic church. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s success in the primaries and caucuses _ including a victory over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> on Saturday _ has created a sticky issue for Democrats bent on picking a nominee who can secure the White House. His campaign chairman, <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said Sunday that the margin of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s successes has surprised even him. But he said that even if <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> gets the most delegates by the end of the primary season, that does n't mean he should get the nomination. `` You can have a plurality of the delegates and still not be able to reach the 2,082 required to secure the nomination,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said on `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>.'' `` I only believe he's entitled to the nomination if we succeed in producing the appropriate number of delgates that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> got, that <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> got, or that <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> got,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> also raised the possibility of the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> forces instigating a rules fight at the convention this summer if the delegate race does not play out as they think it fairly should. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> himself downplayed the possibility it would come to that. `` We're certainly going to stand for fairness, but I hope it wo n't come to a fight. I think that most Demcrats are going to stand for that which is fair and that which is right,'' he said as he campaigned in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. It appears unlikely any Democrat will have enough delegates in hand to secure the nomination at the end of the primary season in June. The nomination thus will lie in the hands of the so-called super delegates, who are automatically delegates by virtue of their position as party leaders or elected officials. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> so far has won 653.5 delegates to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 646.5 and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s 381.8, according to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> tally. Democratic leader <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> on Sunday appeared to moderate his suggestion that his party should rally behind whoever is the frontrunner at the end of the primary season. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said that a candidate who emerges with the most delegates, but shy of the needed 2,082, should not automatically get the party's nod. `` That's not what the rules say. The rules say that the person who attains a majority of delegates will be the party's nominee,'' he said. He said that when he earlier had talked about getting party leaders together to solidify support for a frontrunner, he meant that if anyone gained `` a very very substantial plurality of delegates and someone has the nomination within virtually within his grasp, that the party ought to sit down'' and talk about getting behind that person. Under questioning, he refused to say what would consistute a substantial plurality. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Anbender </PERSON> later said <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>'s views on the matter have not changed. `` <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> has not altered his position about rallying behind the clear-cut frontrunner. He continues to believe that at the end of the process, one of our candidates will clearly emerge from the pack and <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> will at that point encourage the party to rally behind its inevitable nominee,'' she said. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> noted that the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign is actively seeking out support among the superdelegates and the uncommitted delegates, particularly members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who represent districts where <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has run strongly. As if the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> forces would, as they did at the 1984 convention, challenge any rules on how delegates are selected should <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> fail to bring many uncommitted delegates on board, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` I think if the rules need to be challenged we will do so.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> previously has said he has no plans to raise rules challenges at the summer convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. But he has also said he expects the party to treat him fairly.

 A Panamanian military vehicle on Sunday tried to stop the car of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> reported and it called the `` serious.'' <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON>, an embassy spokesman, said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was leaving the residence of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s ambassador in a chauffeur-driven car when a military `` vehicle began following immediately, picking them up right outside the gate. `` It followed them down <LOCATION> Balboa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, then tried to stop them with lights and sirens. The ambassador's driver, in accordance with instructions, did not stop. The ambassador was driven to his residence, and the other vehicle followed all the way.'' `` We consider this serious,'' <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON> added. He said that would be the embassy's only characterization of the incident and referred further questions to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON> said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> had gone to call on the papal nuncio, <PERSON> Monsignor </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON> <PERSON> Laboa </PERSON>, to pay his respects on Easter Sunday. The spokesman noted that the papal ambassador is the dean of the diplomatic corps in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The distance between <PERSON> Laboa </PERSON>'s residence and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ambassador's house is about two miles, and the route followed by <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' car took him along oceanfront <LOCATION> Balboa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>. Sunday's edition of the daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republica </ORGANIZATION>, which is run by the military, carried a front-page picture of <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> with a caption that said he did not venture from his residence unless he was `` armed to the teeth.'' The brief article accused the ambassador of `` exaggerating'' any possible threat to his personal security and said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> suffered from either `` a persecution complex'' or `` guilty conscience.'' The incident came only three days after the Panamanian government said the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, commanded by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, would not do anything to provoke an excuse for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has demanded that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, under federal indictment in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug-trafficking charges, resign. In its statement the government said, `` Aware of the overwhelming power threatening it, the Republic of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> ... will not provide the foundation for fabrication of a charge of aggression that could pretent to justify the launching of acts of war.''

<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The last act of Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s impeachment trial begins Monday with attorneys' final arguments, wrapping up a historical drama involving charges of obstruction of justice and misuse of state funds If the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> votes against him, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> would become the seventh <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governor removed from office by impeachment. The vote could come as early as Monday. It would take a two-thirds vote or 20 of the senators to convict <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who has only been in office a little more than a year. The body then could take a second vote and bar him from holding state office again. If he is acquitted, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> would still face a recall election May 17. He also faces a criminal trial on felony charges associated with alleged concealment of a $ 350,000 campaign loan. That charge was included in the articles of impeachment but was thrown out by senators last week in a surprise vote. The first impeachment charge alleges that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, 63, obstructed justice by impeding an attorney general's investigation of an alleged death threat on a grand jury witness by one of <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s staff members The witness, a former <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> aide, had agreed to testify about <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s campaign finances. In the second charge, he is accused of illegally lending public funds _ $ 80,000 from a protocol fund _ to his auto dealership. An underlying question is whether either of the charges, if sustained, constitutes `` high crimes, malfeasance and misdeameanors,'' the requirement for removing an elected official. The prosecution, in a trial memorandum, urged senators to convict <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. `` The criminal acts and the acts of abuse of power, breach of public trust, neglect of duty and obstruction of justice demand that Gov. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> be removed from office,'' they said. Defense lawyers said they would respond with written arguments Monday. But after five weeks of testimony, the respective positions are clear. Prosecutors say the first-term <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor instructed the state's top lawman, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>, not to cooperate with an attorney general's investigation of the alleged death threat. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who says he was politically `` at war'' with the attorney general, concedes he may have said something like that but insists he acted out of ignorance of the facts. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> claims no one told him details of the alleged threat. A key issue is the credibility of several witnesses, the key ones being <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> and <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>. The second charge involves money. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> says money raised by his inaugural committee to pay off his campaign debts always remained private money even after a law prevented its use for its original purpose. The prosecution says it became public money when it was placed in a protocol fund to pay for gifts to visiting dignitaries and events enhancing the image of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. Undisputed is the fact that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> loaned $ 80,000 from the fund to his car dealership, did not record the deed of trust and paid it back three months later with interest when another campaign finance scandal erupted over the $ 350,000 loan. Prosecutors will say that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s loan was unethical and illegal. Defense lawyers will say it was legal and for the good of the state. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> has contended his only motive was to increase the fund by paying higher interest than it was getting at a bank, disputing the prosecution's contention that the dealership was in financial difficulty and needed the money. Arguments were expected to take about two hours, with each side speaking a half hour on each charge. The procedure of the senators voting on each charge separately could be lengthy, whether it starts Monday or Tuesday. Unlike jurors in a court trial, the 30 senators each get 15 minutes to explain their votes.

 A Panamanian military vehicle tried to stop the chauffeur-driven limousine of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> on Sunday but the diplomat continued on to his residence, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> reported. It called the incident `` serious.'' The effort to stop the ambassador came after Panamanians rich and poor attended church services observing a somber Easter in the crisis over the refusal of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to resign. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> commands the 15,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and as the military strongman is the power behind the civilian government. He is under indictment by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, and has rejected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands that he resign. <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> had visited the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> ambassador and was leaving in his car when a military `` vehicle began following immediately, picking them up right outside the gate. `` It followed them down <LOCATION> Balboa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, then tried to stop them with lights and sirens.

The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has more than 10,000 military personnel in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> under the Panamanian-based <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration said Friday it would sent 1,300 additional soldiers and <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> this week to reinforce security for Americans and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities in the country In a televised Mass, Monsignor <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, the Roman Catholic archbishop of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said, `` This Sunday of the resurrection of 1988 is particularly dramatic for us.'' `` During this Lenten season, we have suffered strong divisions, tensions among the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people,'' he said. `` We have suffered many privations. `` In these final days of Holy Week, half of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has been fasting because it has no food, and the other half has been fasting in sympathy with them.'' The country's economy has foundered since March 4 when <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> closed banks to prevent a run on cash made scarce by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions. The economic chaos was aggravated by a two-week-old general strike that closed down an estimated 90 percent of the country's business and industry. Protesters have taken to the streets, and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s troops have responded with force. The strike eased late last week, with some groceries and pharmacies opening, reportedly under government pressure. Opposition leaders have not formally called off the strike and were to meet Sunday and Monday to discuss whether to continue it. At a Mass at <ORGANIZATION> Cristo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, the Rev. <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Villanueva </PERSON>, an outspoken <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> foe, urged Catholics to support a recent call by <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s nine bishops for the general's resignation. The congregation broke into applause and many waved white handkerchiefs, which have become a symbol of dissent in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s crisis In his Easter homily, <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> spoke of the nation's `` social decomposition.'' He referred to `` the reality of disintegrating homes, the reality of a people increasingly losing confidence in their leaders, the reality of a community misinformed by the partisanizing and falsifying of the news.'' The crisis, which had been building for months, erupted in late February when then-President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who had been indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug-trafficking charges. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s move backfired when <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> dismissed him.

 A gunman early Sunday killed four people and seriously wounded a young woman, but two children found with them inside a mobile home were unhurt, authorities said. A man whose truck fit the description of one seen fleeing the scene was held for questioning, but he had n't been booked in connection with the crimes by late Sunday afternoon, <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's investigators said. <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, 28, was hiding in brush when captured in <LOCATION> Colton </LOCATION>, 10 miles from the shooting scene, after passers-by called authorities to report a man acting suspiciously, sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said. The killings were believed to be the work of a single gunman, Ms. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said, but she refused to elaborate. `` We're not far enough into it to have any motive,'' she said. Two children, who appeared to be about 2 and 5 years old, were found unharmed at the home, <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said. A woman identified as <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimmett </PERSON>, 18, was found seriously wounded at the home but was expected to live, Ms. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said. The name of the hospital was withheld as a security precaution. The bodies of two men and two women were found in the mobile home, which neighbors said was occupied by a couple in their 20s and their two young children. Investigators had not identified any of the four dead people by Sunday afternoon. Officers found the bodies about 5:50 a.m. Sunday after a caller, believed to be Ms. <PERSON> Kimmett </PERSON>, reported an assault in progress, Ms. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said. The mobile home sits behind a larger house on a dusty street in a semirural area 50 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. A sign outside identified the property as Lorrue Kennels, and neighbors said the couple groomed and boarded dogs.

 A town marshal who said he'd been kidnapped by burglars faked his highly publicized disappearance last week, a <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> investigator said. There was an attempted burglary at a local convenience store, but marshal <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> _ the town's only full-time policeman _ fabricated the tale of his abduction, state patrol investigator <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rickels </PERSON> said Saturday. <PERSON> Rickels </PERSON> said he had not uncovered a motive for the phony abduction. <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> could not be reached for comment Sunday because his telephone was busy. His stepmother, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, said she was surprised by the investigator's finding, but did n't feel residents would be angry at her stepson because most were just glad he had returned unharmed. <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, 35, disappeared about 12:55 a.m. Thursday after calling for back-up units while investigating an attempted burglary in this northeastern <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> town of 860 residents. Police arriving at the store found his car with the engine still running, the lights on and his radio microphone hanging outside the door. His revolver and billfold were found nearby. <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> reappeared Friday morning after claiming to have escaped from his captors. `` I knew I was done for anyway and I had nothing to lose,'' <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said at the time. `` When they let me out of the trunk, I hit the ground running and I did n't look back.'' He told reporters that he was `` still nervous and kind of shook up. They had said several times they were going to kill me, and I believed them.'' <PERSON> Rickels </PERSON>, however, said <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> apparently spent the night in the woods or an abandoned house in <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> before turning up Friday. In addition, the attempted burglary actually occurred Thursday afternoon, much earlier than the alleged abduction, <PERSON> Rickels </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>' pistol had been fired, but somewhere other than near his squad car, <PERSON> Rickels </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> claimed the gun went off in a struggle with his captors. Lawmen used tracking dogs in the rain as they searched for <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> in rural areas surrounding Blue Mountain on Thursday and well into the night. <PERSON> Rickels </PERSON> said he will discuss his findings with the district attorney.

 There was a time when the only boots associated with this city were cowboy and ski boots, but that changed more than 30 years ago when police asked an inventor to make a device that would immobilize a parked car. In his small pattern-making shop in west <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marugg </PERSON> designed a 12-pound, jawlike clamp that was first used by the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in 1955. <PERSON> Marugg </PERSON> died 15 years ago, but his <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boot </ORGANIZATION> continues to torment parking violators and scofflaws. Many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities use the original <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boot </LOCATION> or a variation, and it also has been used in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> city and county officials were enthusiastic about the boot from the start. Some 200 <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> Boots are used in the metro area `` and we're ordering more,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON>, chief of the boot detail for the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's department. The county employs four full-time booters who seek out cars registered to motorists who have n't paid fines. Once a car is located, it takes about 19 seconds to fasten one of the 12-pound boots over the front wheel, said <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON>. The jaw-like clamp covers the hubcap, making it impossible to remove the tire; trying to drive with the boot can severely damage a tire. The Denver Boot is made of an aluminum alloy with a breaking strength of 32,000 pounds per square inch. <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON> said the boots _ which are clamped on cars about 40 or 50 times a day in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> _ add $ 1.5 million each year to the city and county's general fund. Motorist can get `` de-booted'' only by paying all fines. <PERSON> Marugg </PERSON>'s daughter <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>, who has taken over the manufacturing and marketing of her father's most famous invention, said last week, `` They've been unable to improve on it.'' <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>, 62, runs the company out of her suburban home. A foundry pours the metal parts and a mechanic assembles them. She recalled how the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> police asked her father in the early 1950s for a device to eliminate the need to tow. `` They were running out of space in the city garages, and it also relieved the problem of inventorying each car that was towed in,'' she said. <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> said she sells between 50 and 100 boots a year and charges $ 275 apiece. <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> gets a special rate, she said, because it buys so many. `` It's not a fast-moving object _ they usually last a long time,'' said <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>. <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> said she also sells many boots to parking garage owners in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and a few to owners of expensive cars who want to protect them from thieves.

 Giggling hordes of children raced to find Easter eggs Sunday, a day that drew millions of Americans to church services, and for some it was a day to welcome spring with a day in the park or a strut down the avenue. And there were some who devoted the day to helping others, like 80-year-old <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, who went to an early Mass so she could drive her rounds delivering hot meals to 22 shut-ins for the Meals on Wheels Program in <LOCATION> Lawrenceville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` The volunteers are the backbone of the organization. That becomes apparent on holidays,'' said program director <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. Easter egg hunts are getting bigger and bigger. Organizers of one program at Wheeler Historic Farm park at <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> estimated that twice as many children would show up as participated last year, so they stocked up on 3,000 bags of candy and peanuts, and hid about 4,500 colored eggs. However, about 5,000 children lined up for the candy. And then there was the egg hunt. `` When we cut them loose and they ran out there, you could n't see the hayfield for all the people,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, an officer in the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, officials hid more than 10,000 Easter eggs on the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> Arboretum grounds. Across the state in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, city park officials used bullhorns to urge the crowd to hold back until the go-ahead signal, but nearly 2,000 children stampeded in search of Easter eggs, candy and prizes in <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> during the 10th Annual Easter Eggstravaganza. In <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, between 75 and 200 gay rights supporters attended services at the Second Baptist Church to protest the exclusion of a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> horn player with AIDS and tuberculosis who had been scheduled to perform at the service. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, spent a quiet Easter at their secluded ranch in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ynez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>. They did not attend church, and there was no gathering of relatives. Elsewhere in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, motorcyclists participated in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>'s annual `` blessing of the bikes'' and the Rev. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Glide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> symbolically attacked the burgeoning cocaine trade with a cross, which he jabbed through a white papier-mache sphere. And about 12,000 people awoke before dawn to attend the 68th traditional Easter Sunrise Service at the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bowl </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s Fifth Avenue was closed to traffic in midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> for the annual Easter Parade of people displaying their holiday finery and bonnets. About 2,000 people braved cloudy weather for <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s Easter Promenade, strolling up and down Walnut Street near fashionable Rittenhouse Square while several bands took turns serenading the crowd `` I'm having a great time. The kids have been really great,'' said <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Folkman </PERSON>, dressed as an Easter Bunny to hand out coconut cream eggs to children. She said six city employees volunteered to hit the bunny trail for the day. Judges pinned ribbons on anyone wearing appealing outfits or hats. The people with ribbons were invited to a final judging on the square. At a less festive site, a group of inmates sentenced to life in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Rahway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> threw a small party in a room set aside in the visiting area for other inmates' children, said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Papciak </PERSON>, an associate member of the group and its executive secretary. `` Five or six members who do n't get visitors entertained the children with Easter eggs and things like that,'' said <PERSON> Papciak </PERSON>, 37, who has served 14 years of a 25-year sentence for armed robbery. Archbishop <PERSON> Torkom </PERSON> <PERSON> Manoogian </PERSON>, primate of the <ORGANIZATION> Armenian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, released a white dove in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in honor of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoris </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Karabagh </LOCATION>, who brought Christianity to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. The archbishop also said a prayer for Armenians in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> trying to reunite their homeland. Roman Catholic homosexuals chanting `` Shame! Shame!'' to protest their exclusion from the church greeted Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> when he emerged from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Patrick </LOCATION>'s Cathedral in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> after his Easter homily. Eighteen people objecting to the cardinal's stance on homosexuality were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct when they ignored orders to move from in front of the church. After the Mass, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> told reporters that anyone willing to accord with the church's teachings was welcome. `` Many of the people who were demonstrating today tell me the church should change its teachings. The church is n't going to change its teachings,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, homeless demonstrators attended Easter services at a church whose pastor is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>'s board `` The things that <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> died for are very much in existence today,'' said <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Chicago-Gary Area Union for the Homeless, an advocacy group for the area's estimated 25,000 homeless people The Rev. <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, chairman of the authority's board and pastor of the non-denominational <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, welcomed the homeless to his service.

<TEXT>
 A majority of Democrats and voters leaning toward the party say <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> should get the Democratic nomination if he leads in delegates at the time of the convention, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> poll released Sunday. Sixty-six percent of those polled said that if <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had more delegates and more of the popular vote than the other <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidates _ but not enough to win the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nomination outright _ the party's other candidates should rally behind him. A total of 20 percent said the other candidates should not rally behind him, the poll said. Seventy-two percent of the respondents said there is no one other than the current candidates whom they would prefer to see running for the presidency. Only 8 percent favored <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> getting into the race, and Sens. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> had the support of 1 percent each. Despite the hefty majority saying <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> should get the nomination if he has the most delegates, his negative ratings remain high, and Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> runs stronger against Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> than he does. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> got a favorable rating from 53 percent of those polled, with 38 percent saying they had an unfavorable opinion of him. In a <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> poll conducted in April 1987, 51 percent said their opinion of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was favorable; 41 percent said they viewed him unfavorably. Thirteen percent of the respondents in Sunday's survey described their opinion of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as `` very favorable'' and 40 percent said their view of him was `` mostly favorable.'' Twenty-four percent said their opinion of him was `` mostly unfavorable,'' with 14 percent saying it was `` very unfavorable.'' A survey of registered Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> voters showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 49 percent to 44 percent; <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was favored over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 58 percent to 32 percent, according to <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION>. In the poll, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> got high marks for honesty, his stand on social issues and leadership ability. Seventy-two percent said they feel he is `` honest and sincere''; 60 percent said he's a `` champion of social justice''; and 56 percent said he `` would be a strong and forceful leader.'' At the other end of the spectrum, 25 percent said he `` creates bad feelings between blacks and Jews'' and 34 percent said he `` can manage the federal government.'' Fifty-seven percent said that if <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> were the vice-presidential nominee, they would be neither more nor less likely to vote Democratic in the upcoming election. The Gallup Organization interviewed 757 registered voters, including 366 Democrats or leaning Democrats by telephone March 30 and 31. The margin of error for questions directed at Democrats and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaners was 6 percentage points. For questions directed at Democrats and Republicans, the margin of error was 4 percentage points.

 Troops raided the seaside vacation house of opposition Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> on Sunday but failed to find the leader of an August coup attempt who fled his prison ship, the military said. A <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> paper, meanwhile, reported that nine other officers believed to be involved in past coup attempts had fled a detention center on Saturday. The report could not be confirmed. The raid on <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>'s house in <LOCATION> Batangas </LOCATION> province, southwest of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, was part of as nationwide search for former Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, leader of the Aug. 28 coup attempt that nearly toppled the Aquino government, said military officials. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, 39, escaped from a prison ship before dawn Saturday with 14 elite navy personnel who were supposed to be guarding him. He had been confined there since his arrest Dec. 9 for the attempted coup that left at least 53 people dead and hundreds wounded. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who had refused to grant amnesty to <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, warned soldiers and civilians not to aid the charismatic former colonel, who is popular among many in the 160,000-member armed forces. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> served as chief of security at the defense ministry when <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> was defense chief. <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> told reporters Sunday he had not heard from <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> since the escape. `` I'm beginning to sense that they treat me as an enemy,'' said <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, who was fired in November 1986, after an alleged coup attempt by his followers. `` Why do n't they say it openly and publicly?'' Chief of Staff Gen. <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> ordered a nationwide alert in the wake of <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>'s escape and warned that leftist and rightist extremists may try to exploit the confusion created by the former colonel's dramatic flight. Trucks blocked all entrances to military garrisons in the capital, and troops refused to allow reporters and other civilians to enter the compounds. Police set up checkpoints on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and placed homes of <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>'s friends and associates under surveillance. Extra troops were deployed around the presidential palace. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> also ordered troops on alert in central and southern <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> islands in case disgruntled officers and politicians try to exploit the volatile situation in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and stage attacks against government installations. The <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday that nine other soldiers held in connection with coup attempts last August and in January 1987 had fled the detention center at <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s Villamor Air Base early Saturday. The report could not be immediately confirmed. The newspaper quoted an unidentified air force officer as confirming the escape. The newspaper said the <PERSON> Villamor </PERSON> incident strengthened speculation that <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>'s escape was part of a broad conspiracy within the armed forces. <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> newspapers also reported leaflets were circulating in military camps calling for the overthrow of the government. The leaflets allegedly were from <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>'s Reform the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, the papers said. Meanwhile, investigators said <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> and the others apparently fled the prison ship aboard rubber dinghies and came ashore near the Folk Arts Center, a few hundred meters from the headquarters of the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> navy. They then boarded seven cars which had been waiting for them, investigators said. The <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday that <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> left behind a note when he fled the ship saying he was escaping because `` the struggle for a better AFP -LRB- Armed Forces of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> -RRB- must go on.'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> played a key role in the Feb. 22, 1986, civilian-military uprising that toppled President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and brought Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power. But he later accused Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> of weak and inept leadership in the face of the communist insurgency.

<HEAD>Settlement May Be Near in Lawsuit Involving Kodak Instant Camera</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lawyers may be close to a settlement that will compensate millions of people who bought <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> instant cameras but now ca n't get film, according to a published report. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, in its Monday editions, said a settlement in <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is expected in the next few weeks. `` Serious negotiations are under way,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>.

 About 300 Maoist guerrillas raided a mountain town, driving the police into hiding, burning several government buildings and killing a police captive, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. It said 15 policemen stationed in <LOCATION> Panao </LOCATION>, 200 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, fled as the rebels attacked at dusk Saturday, but one officer was captured and shot to death. The ministry communique said it was believed the other policemen were in hiding in the surrounding forests and reinforcements had been sent to the area. The raid was one of the largest carried out by the Shining Path guerrillas since they began their insurgency eight years ago. According to the communique, the rebels held the town for about two hours, burning government buildings and then escaping.

 Under police and army guard, pilgrims from around the world gathered at dawn for Easter Sunday services in the church marking the site where most Christians believe <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> rose from the dead. About 1,000 worshipers _ half as many as last year _ attended services in the 12th century Church of the Holy Sepulcher, church officials said. Many pilgrims were scared away by four months of almost daily violence in the Israeli-occupied territories that have left more than 130 Palestinians and one Israeli soldier dead. The Greek Orthodox Church canceled three pre-Easter processions scheduled for the weekend.

<HEAD>There's Something Fishy About Marilyn Doane's Business</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELMONT, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Having hooked area markets and restaurants with her pitch for locally-grown fish, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Doane </PERSON> has netted the first profits from the trout-farming business she began three years ago. A venture that started with 1,000 fingerlings now operates on a bigger scale: 42,000 fish, 17 ponds and some 35 commercial customers in the Grand Rapids area. <PERSON> Doane </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> also has begun showing a little profit for the former carpenter. `` It turned around in January; I made $ 6,'' <PERSON> Doane </PERSON> said. Before starting her fishery, the 38-year-old <PERSON> Doane </PERSON> knew little about the fish-farming business. She was a trained secretary, who along with her husband <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> built and operated a mobile home park while also operating their own heavy construction equipment. They sold the park in 1981 and moved to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> _ flying in a restored 1947 fabric-covered airplane _ and on returning bought a 30-acre topsoil farm in <LOCATION> Belmont </LOCATION>, just north of <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rapids </LOCATION>. The couple rented out a house to a biologist and an ichthyologist, who said their farmland was just right for raising trout, a fish that likes cool water year-round. The observations spawned the idea for a trout farm. <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Doane </PERSON> took an intensive, two-week course in cold-water fish hatching at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Traverse </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and gave up her carpentry job to go into the business. She started with 1,000 fingerlings and in a couple of years built a business that now sells about 3,000 fish a month, overcoming obstacles such as a 1986 dam break that flooded her ponds and cost her 6,000 fish. The business supplies 35 commercial customers, including 20 D & amp; W supermarkets in the Grand Rapids area, restaurants, country clubs and fish stores. <PERSON> Doane </PERSON> is putting in more ponds and building an addition to her house for more efficient fish processing. `` Its potential is almost beyond what I can imagine,'' <PERSON> Doane </PERSON> said. Her biggest sales point is that the fish are locally grown. `` The hot button in the food business is locally raised products,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Astma </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> D </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; W's meat manager who promotes the fish with signs like `` <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>'s Trout _ grown in Belmont'' at the chain's fish counters. Astma convinced D & amp; W executives to carry <PERSON> Doane </PERSON>'s trout in their stores by bringing the chain's president and vice president of marketing to the farm for a picnic. It cinched the deal. `` You just have to be there to understand what's going on,'' <PERSON> Astma </PERSON> said.

But <PERSON> Ruppel </PERSON> said the new foreign plant would not affect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production because the Asian market was expanding. <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest tire manufacturer, has 88 plants in 27 nations, including seven in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>'s sales last year were $ 9.9 billion. The planned Korean plant, which should be completed in Spring 1991, will produce more than 3 million steel-belted radial tires annually. `` We need this factory to supply the expanding export requirement of <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>'s current business in <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> markets other than <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Spanninger </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> director of technology and venture management. `` Our sales to the Japanese auto industry are growing rapidly.'' The company will export 75 percent of the tires made at the South Korean plant to <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries, primarily <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and 25 percent would be for exported Korean-built cars. <PERSON> Ruppel </PERSON> said talks with South Korean officials began about three years ago and the company applied last fall for permission to build the plant. He said the Korean plant would be smaller than any of the company's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities and its technology would be on par with that of some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plants.

March was the 20th consecutive month above the break-even mark. `` The economy completed the first quarter with moderate, if not substantial, growth,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bretz </PERSON>, chairman of the group's business survey committee, said in a statement `` The healthy increase in new orders, particularly export orders, along with the anticipated slowing of price increases, signals continued improvement in the economy in the second quarter.'' March represented the 15th consecutive month of growth in new orders, according to the survey. Thirty-two percent of the purchasing mangers polled reported higher levels of new orders, compared with 31 percent in February and 35 percent in January. Of those whose companies export, 41 percent said their export orders were higher in March, while 3 percent said they were lower. That was up from 33 percent in February and 39 percent in January. The monthly report is based on a survey of more than 250 industrial purchasing managers who belong to the national organization. Among other findings of the survey: _ Production growth slowed from February, although it was at a level still considered very healthy Members who reported stronger production outweighed those reporting weaker, 32 percent to 8 percent. _ Deliveries from vendors slowed for the 18th consecutive month, a reflection of the slowdown in deliveries Twenty-three percent said they had slower deliveries, compared with 5 percent reporting faster. _ Inventories declined sharply after growing modestly in the past two months Twenty-three percent said they had lower inventories, vs. 10 percent who had higher. _ Fifty-five percent reported higher prices, compared with 64 percent in February, indicating a decline in inflation Three percent reported lower prices, up from 1 percent in February. _ Employment grew for an eighth straight month, although the results could be viewed as a slight decline considering normal seasonal increases expected in March _ Prices rose for a wide variety of raw materials and fell for only a few, including fuel oil, natural gas, diesel fuel and chlorine _ Products in short supply included aluminum, steel and other metals and a variety of chemicals

 <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> gained a major new presence in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shopping malls by winning an agreement to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, but will lose some of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s diversity in the process. To help finance its $ 73.50 a share, $ 6.58 billion buyout of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>, Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said it would sell several other <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> chains </ORGANIZATION> and one of its own holdings. But <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> initially will keep <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s `` crown jewel'' retailers _ <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>'s, <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON>, <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>'s, <LOCATION> Burdines </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Abraham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Straus </LOCATION> _ that are seen as giving it a key foothold in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> malls. The combined Federated-Campeau will be the nation's fourth-largest retailer with annual sales of about $ 15 billion, trailing only <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts say a key <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> goal in the bitter, two-month battle against <ORGANIZATION> R.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for control of Cincinnati-based Federated, which ended with Friday's merger agreement, was to acquire real estate, especially in major Stores such as the <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> crown jewels are regarded as `` anchors,'' the one or two major stores generally placed in a mall to attract shoppers. Such heavyweights as <PERSON> Bloomingdale </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON>, in addition to its present <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marsh </LOCATION> operations, give <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> instant entree to some malls while increasing its negotiating strength with developers of new malls. `` If you are an anchor tenant, you may get 10 to 20 per cent of a -LRB- shopping -RRB- center for free,'' said one industry analyst with a Canadian firm, who asked not to be identified. `` If you were in a position to commit two or three choice anchors _ as <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> would be able to do _ you might get 30 to 40 per cent.'' The analyst noted <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Campeau </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, built the company as a real estate and mall developer, and speculated <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> now could `` make a shopping center just by agreeing to locate the anchors.'' To acquire such benefits, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> agreed to sell to <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> the <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnin </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>'s - <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> operations of Federated for $ <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> had agreed earlier in the takeover fight to sell its <ORGANIZATION> Brooks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> clothing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> chain </ORGANIZATION> _ which it acquired in its 1986 takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Marks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Spencer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> for $ 720 million. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> also had agreed to sell <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s Texas-based <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s and Boston-based <ORGANIZATION> Filene </ORGANIZATION>'s department stores to <ORGANIZATION> May </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION> Furthermore, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> has said already it would sell <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Filene </ORGANIZATION>'s Basement stores in response to antitrust concerns among several Northeastern states, has plans to sell <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s supermarket and specialty store chains and widely is expected to sell other department store The pattern mirrors the path <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> took after acquiring Allied for $ 3.6 billion, when he sold most of the company's store operations to help pay off the debt incurred to make the deal. Although the divestments stemming from the <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> deal will enable <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> to make the transaction, some analysts say the sales will eliminate some of the variety that made <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> such an attractive company at the outset. `` <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s victory is a great one, but he's giving up a lot for it,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON>, a retail industry analyst with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` He's going to end up with just the core department stores and end <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s long tradition of diversity,'' <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON> and other analysts have said that by eliminating that diversity the Campeau-Federated coupling continued the recent trend toward `` sameness'' among the nation's big retailers. Some industry watchers believe that under <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> will consolidate operations such as purchasing and marketing that are now carried out separately by the <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> units. That could dampen innovation created by having more retailers buying and experimenting with new merchandise, which fosters new styles and trends.
