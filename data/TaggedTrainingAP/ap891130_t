 A man who spoke Russian entered a store in the bazaar, opened a black briefcase and produced an automatic weapon. After several minutes of negotiation, the shopkeeper paid him 200,000 afghanis, or $ 500, for the gun. When a reporter approached him in the street seconds later and addressed him in English, the man got into a green jeep without license plates and drove away. Who was this man? Merchants said he and dozens like him identify themselves as Soviet soldiers. Since the Soviet withdrawal was completed Feb. 15, they say, those `` soldiers'' have sold them at least 20 automatic weapons. Where the men are stationed, or what they are doing here, the shopkeepers can only guess. Diplomats from countries with close ties to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> say the only <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldier in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is the embassy military attache. They say all the others left in February. The Afghan government's position on the issue has not been clear. On Oct. 14, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Bakhtar </ORGANIZATION> reported the presence of Soviet military advisers in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. It added that they `` only handle deliveries of arms and provide information on the specifications of arms and ammunition to the Afghan side, and do not take part in military operations at all.'' A day later, government spokesman <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Bakhtar </ORGANIZATION> report was `` an error,'' that there were no Soviet soldiers in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Another government official quoted an Afghan military officer as saying <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> soldiers operated a missile base on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. He said the Soviets were unwilling to train Afghan soldiers to use the Scud rockets they provide, which require advanced tracking methods and use of computers. More than 1,000 Scuds have been fired and the government has credited them with important victories over Moslem guerrillas, according to diplomats in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence report has alleged that Soviets in Afghan uniforms operate the Scud base. Many diplomats discount the report and say Soviet soldiers no longer are engaged in combat in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Some add, however, that Soviet officers direct the civil war and the operations of <ORGANIZATION> KHAD </ORGANIZATION>, the Afghan intelligence and secret police agency, at the Defense and Interior ministries. A communist bloc journalist who visited the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> frequently said he discovered Soviet advisers in several departments. `` Any country that is supplying billions of dollars a year to another country is not going to sit by and let that country direct its war effort,'' one diplomat said. Such influence by the Soviets over <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s security, politics and economy has created problems between the two governments. Afghan officials say privately that Soviet officials tend to treat them like colonial subjects, and a recent incident illustrates the point. Journalists were taken to a battlefield to see captured weapons. A Soviet bodyguard armed with grenades, an assault rifle and seven clips of ammunition accompanied a Soviet television crew. During the helicopter flight to <LOCATION> Lalandar </LOCATION>, 12 miles south of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the bodyguard, dressed in blue jeans and a combat jacket, ordered an Afghan officer to give up his seat and barked commands to the pilot. When a Swiss journalist snapped his photograph, the guard grabbed the camera and exposed the film. The journalist appealed to officials from the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, who said they could do nothing. The ministry later protested to the Soviet Embassy. And the question still remains: Who was the man in the bazaar?

 The operator of a crane that collapsed and killed five people said he was considering entering an alcohol treatment program to `` dry out'' after his work on the high-rise was over, his brother said Thursday. The crane operator, <PERSON> Lonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Boggess </PERSON>, was among those killed in Tuesday's accident. He had twice tried to commit suicide during the last nine months and had been hospitalized for psychiatric observation twice since March, according to court documents obtained by <ORGANIZATION> McClatchy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Boggess </PERSON>, 45, died with three other construction workers and a school bus driver when the 240-ton crane he was operating plunged 16 floors in the bustling Financial District. <PERSON> Boggess </PERSON>' brother, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, said the machine operator had a drinking problem and suffered from stress related to his high-risk job. `` He told me he was considering admitting himself to an alcohol program to dry out after this job was over,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Boggess </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> coroner's office said Thursday that an autopsy would attempt to determine <PERSON> Boggess </PERSON>' blood-alcohol level at the time of death. It will be made public in two to three weeks, the coroner's office said. Family members were also `` concerned about, perhaps, a heart problem or stroke,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Boggess </PERSON> said from his home in <LOCATION> Exeter </LOCATION>, a small city in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. But he conceded he had no specific information that his sibling, a heavy smoker, had a heart condition. `` We mostly were concerned about high cholesterol,'' said <PERSON> Boggess </PERSON>, a sales executive. He attributed his brother's problems to `` a bitter divorce and the stress of a high-risk job.'' Authorities were checking into reports that <PERSON> Boggess </PERSON> was seen slumped over the controls as the crane began its plunge. `` We're waiting for the coroner's report to find out whether there may have been a heart attack or something like that, because we have heard _ they are unconfirmed reports _ that someone saw him slumped over,'' said District Attorney <PERSON> Arlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` We're trying to find that individual, if there is somebody, who reported seeing that.'' <PERSON> Boggess </PERSON>' sister, 34-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Genoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hefke </ORGANIZATION>, said she spoke Wednesday afternoon with a worker who was on the ground and in radio contact with <PERSON> Boggess </PERSON> before the accident. She said the worker told her that the radio suddenly went silent and that <PERSON> Boggess </PERSON> may have had a heart attack. `` All of a sudden he stopped answering, and then it started rocking back and forth,'' she said. The state <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, said it is investigating reports of illegal drug use among workers at the construction job site, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Friday editions. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairburn </PERSON>, the agency's deputy director, said <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> would conduct toxicological tests on the bodies of <PERSON> Boggess </PERSON> and three other workers who died, the Times reported. <PERSON> Boggess </PERSON> was in the crane's cab 200 feet above the ground when the accident occurred. The crane was being raised from the 16th floor to the 20th floor of a high-rise under construction for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. The reports of <PERSON> Boggess </PERSON>' alcoholism and suicide attempts appeared in Thursday's editions of The Sacramento Bee and The Morning News Tribune of <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Boggess </PERSON> lived. <PERSON> Boggess </PERSON>' employer, the <ORGANIZATION> Erection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Kirkland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, refused to comment. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Swinerton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Walberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the general contractor for the high-rise project, `` had no knowledge of his personal life,'' said company spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Duggan </PERSON>. The contractor said the accident apparently was triggered when the head of the crane accidentally rotated 180 degrees while the crane's height was being increased, an operation that requires the machine to be perfectly balanced. However, it said in a statement that the rotation occurred `` for unknown reasons.'' State officials say they are focusing on mechanical or human error, giving `` low priority to such factors as wind or structural failure,'' said <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fairburn </LOCATION>, deputy chief of the state <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Western Companies said Negotiating to Market Soviet Fighter Jets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hungry for foreign currency and Western consumer technology, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is seeking to sell its MiG-29 warplanes in the West, a respected journal of military affairs reports. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weekly </ORGANIZATION> says in its issue published Wednesday that Western companies are negotiating to buy MiG-29 `` Fulcrum'' fighters, first operational in 1985, for research and experimental purposes. The <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> recently hosted a joint venture group of six American, British, West German and Danish businessmen who could act as a sales outlet for up to 150 MiG-29s at $ 20 million apiece, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s said. Quoting an unnamed businessman who participated, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s said a <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> agency told the visitors that the `` whole range of MiGs,'' was available to Western customers, as well as the Sukhoi Su-25 `` Frogfoot.'' The MiG is named after the initials of its original designers, <PERSON> Artem </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikoyan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurevich </PERSON>. `` Fulcrum'' and `` Frogfoot'' are <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> codenames. MiGs have long been a symbol of superpower rivalry. They featured in the Korean and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> wars, in the Soviet-supplied air forces of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> countries against the U.S.-supplied Israelis, and now in the Ethiopian civil war. Starting with the MiG-15 and leading up to today's MiG-31, each new generation and its Western rivals symbolized a fresh escalation of the East-West arms race. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> declined to comment. The British <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said it knew nothing of the reported proposals. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s said the businessmen's visit was prompted by the apparent grounding of MiG-23 `` Flogger'' aircraft said to be used by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in aggressor training roles at <ORGANIZATION> Nellis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. It said the U.S.-operated MiGs were reportedly obtained from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in an arms deal involving U.S.-made F-16s, and were grounded because of their poor condition. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s quoted one of the businessmen as saying the joint venture group has already mediated to provide these MiG-23s with spare engines. A businessman was quoted as saying the Soviets were keen to sell modern warplanes to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> because they are `` almost desperate to bring in foreign currency and modern consumer technology such as telefax machines, microwave cookers, desktop and hand-held computers ... `` They used to request very large deposits, but now they're acting like normal businessmen.

 The head of the people's front of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> says he expects President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to ask <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> for guarantees not to use force against peaceful independence movements in the Baltic republic. `` We have the right to be an independent state,'' <PERSON> Vytautas </PERSON> <PERSON> Landsbergis </PERSON>, chairman of the people's front, or <ORGANIZATION> Sajudis </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday. He said he asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policymakers to seek a commitment that the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> security police will not crack down on secessionist movements in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> or the neighboring republics of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>. `` My information is that they will'' seek such a commitment, said <PERSON> Landsbergis </PERSON>, who met Wednesday with <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> Affairs. <PERSON> Landsbergis </PERSON>, in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> editors and reporters, declined to disclose details of his discussions with <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have not specified what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will tell <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> when he meets with him in this weekend's shipboard summit off the coast of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Landsbergis </PERSON>, a 57-year-old musicologist, praised the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for refusing to recognize the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s forced annexation of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> at the end of World War II. The Soviet parliament this week passed legislation to give the Baltic republics a large degree of economic autonomy from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, a significant step toward independence. `` The recent legislation should mean we will be able to be less attached to the colonial -LRB- centrally planned Soviet -RRB- system, and should have more room to maneuver,'' he said. Last March, in the most democratic elections in Soviet history, <ORGANIZATION> Sajudis </ORGANIZATION> candidates won 36 of 42 seats allocated to <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> in the national <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Landsbergis </PERSON> predicted that <PERSON> Sajudis </PERSON> would win a majority in elections scheduled for February for the Lithuanian parliament, which he said would then negotiate for independence from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` But <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> might not hear our declaration,'' he said. Therefore, <PERSON> Landsbergis </PERSON> said he asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials to seek guarantees of non-intervention and to raise the issue at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> or another international forum. `` We have received support from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for decades in that it has refused to recognize the legality of Soviet annexation. And that has had great importance to us,'' he said. `` Now that the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> issue has become a matter of international importance, we would like <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy to become even more active. `` We would like the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> occupation to be raised at the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> summit as an international issue that has not been resolved,'' he said. `` Soviet efforts to portray the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> issue as an internal affair have failed.'' <PERSON> Sajudis </PERSON>' immediate goals, he said, are to `` have a pluralistic, multi-party system, and in conjunction with that, to eliminate the monopoly by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the privileges that go with it.'' `` The object is to re-establish sovereignty not only as an expression of our own legitimate right, but because we feel that it is useful for <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in general and also very useful for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` We already have that which we would call spiritual independence. Our people have lost their fear and openly speak their minds,'' <PERSON> Landsbergis </PERSON> said. Asked whether a sovereign <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> would join the Kremlin-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> military alliance, <PERSON> Landsbergis </PERSON> said, `` It is possible that it will be a condition for gaining our independence.'' Soviet and Lithuanian negotiators will sit down at a bargaining table in the foreseeable future to hammer out details of Lithuanian independence, he predicted, `` and it may well be that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will make entry into the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact one of the conditions.''

<HEAD>Six New Sites Chosen for Rail-Based MX</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, as President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> departs for the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> summit with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, says it will move ahead with plans making the giant MX nuclear missile a rail-mounted weapon. The 50 intercontinental ballistic missiles _ which are to be stored at military sites scattered around the country and moved on trains during times of crisis _ are designed to launch a devastating retaliation in the face of any Soviet attack. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday that the 50 missiles in underground silos in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> will be moved to `` garrisons,'' or shelters, at military installations in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. The dispersal will allow the weapons to survive a surprise strike, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> argued, as well as provide `` the potential for prompt retaliation vital to the successful deterrence of war.'' The new system is expected to be completed by 1994, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said. The Soviets have two land-based mobile ICBMs, the SS-25 and SS-24. The 50 MX missiles _ dubbed the `` Peacekeeper'' by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ will be placed on 25 trains, each with two MX missiles aboard. The trains will be kept on seven <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> bases and moved onto civilian railroad tracks in time of crisis. The announcement came Wednesday as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> prepared to depart for his <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said the meeting will permit the leaders `` to be in much better shape and much better prepared'' to reach an agreement on slashing such long-range weaponry at their second summit set for next year. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet leaders have expressed hopes of signing an agreement at that later meeting to cut strategic weapons by as much as 50 percent. But Wednesday's announcement also represents the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's commitment to push ahead with plans to modernize the nation's strategic nuclear missile force, even amid projections of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> belt-tightening, heightened prospects for arms-control agreements and sweeping changes in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact allies. The new basing system is the latest step in the controversial missile's 18-year history. The MX _ which stands for missile experimental _ was first proposed in 1971. In its early development, it was seen as a mobile missile designed to prevent the Soviets from knowing where to aim to destroy it. Subsequently, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> studied more than 30 `` basing modes,'' including trucking it around the country, submerging it in lakes, or keeping it airborne on special planes. In 1979, President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> proposed shuttling the weapon on `` racetracks'' in southern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> rejected that plan in 1981. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, in a four-year battle with the administration, slashed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s request for 100 of the missiles to 50, and they were placed in hardened underground silos. In 1986, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposed shifting to the rail-based system advocated by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier this year, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opted to move forward with two mobile intercontinental ballistic missile systems by putting the 10-warhead MX on trains while also building the smaller, truck-based Midgetman. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision has run into considerable opposition in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ both among those who contend the two-prong program is too expensive and among those who favor one weapon or the other. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed a military spending bill last week that establishes a $ 1.1 billion fund for both the MX and the Midgetman, with the exact spending split left to <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. The cost of taking the nation's 50 MX missiles out of their underground silos at <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and building the new `` garrisons,'' or shelters, is expected to be at least $ 5.6 billion, said a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> source who requested anonymity. `` Hopefully, it will be completed by 1994, but that clearly depends on the budget,'' the source said. The Pentagon said the missile trains will be housed at <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION> and these other <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> bases: <PERSON> Barksdale </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, Fairchild in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forks </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wurtsmith </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> AFB </PERSON> will be the center of the MX operation and the training site for the garrison crews.

<HEAD>Rail Car Shortage May Affect Agriculture</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One of the biggest agricultural problems of the next decade will be a shortage of railroad cars for transporting grain, a railroad spokesman says. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Howarth </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> assistant vice president, said Wednesday that his company has about 13,000 covered hopper cars, but that nationwide the fleet is shrinking. <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's largest freight railway companies, operates between the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and as far south as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Howarth </PERSON> said railroad companies do n't get enough profit from hauling grain, and that big freight companies will abandon more and more lines for lack of business in many rural areas. `` You ca n't get away from the fact that the railroad system was overbuilt for today's transportation,'' <PERSON> Howarth </PERSON> said, adding that his company supports the growth of shortline rail companies to carry products short distances or to larger freight train systems. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said some business might return to railroads as the cost and congestion of trucking increases. <PERSON> Howarth </PERSON> and <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> spoke at Outlook'90, a three-day conference sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to examine farm policies and factors that affect them. <PERSON> Howarth </PERSON> said that when <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> decides to discontinue a line, it looks for a shortline operator to take over. `` We want to see as many lines as possible continue operating,'' he said. `` Shortline owners are sometimes public entities, but 90 percent tend to be private owners who feel they can make a go of a piece of railroad that a big company ca n't.'' <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Howarth </PERSON> said, recommends that grain companies buy their own railroad cars to ensure transportation is available. During another segment of the conference Wednesday, a housing consultant described the plight of elderly farm workers who often find themselves with no money and no home when they retire. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Belden </PERSON>, deputy executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said a study he conducted showed no federal housing projects exist specifically for farm workers. Although they often qualify for subsidized housing under other programs, the biggest problem is that farm workers tend to stop working about age 45 rather than 62 as required to qualify for retirement housing under many federal programs. `` Because of the working conditions, this group is going to be older at a younger age,'' <PERSON> Belden </PERSON> said, describing the back-breaking toil and harsh lifestyle of migrant farmworkers. He said there was anecdotal evidence to show that many farm workers do n't get Social Security benefits, either because their employers never withheld payments from their wages or because they were stolen by dishonest employers. Another problem facing rural planners is poverty among children. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> demographer, said studies show that since the late 1970s there has been an increase in poverty among both urban and rural occupants. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said that in 1987 about 24 percent of the children in rural areas were below the poverty line. Another 9 percent were considered `` near poor,'' which means they are either right at the poverty line or in families that make just 149 percent of the poverty threshold. The poverty threshold of a three-person family with one child under 18 was $ 9,142 in 1987 and for a four-person family with two children under 18 it was $ 11,519. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said much attention had been paid to the breakdown of families in central cities, but statistics show that the number of rural children living with just one parent also has increased _ from 14 percent in 1960 to 25 percent in 1988. About 29 percent of urban children live with one parent. Rural development policies need to include education and employment that lead to greater earnings for parents and improved financial conditions for their children, <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. `` The type of childhood experienced in the rural community will undoubtedly affect the decisions of the next generation about remaining in the community,'' she said.

 Providing security for the superpower summit is a huge task for this tiny country, which will dedicate its entire military and most of its police to protecting the American and Soviet presidents. The shipboard location of this weekend's summit between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Marsaxlokk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> has added to security problems and stretched Maltese resources, one official said. But Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenech </PERSON> <PERSON> Adami </PERSON> and others say no special security problems are posed by <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, which is about 220 miles north of <LOCATION> Marsaxlokk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, or by the ability of Libyans to travel freely here. Maltese officials say they are confident their 1,200-member armed forces and 1,800-member police force can protect the leaders during their three-day stay. `` I think our police forces and armed forces are equipped enough and trained enough to provide the necessary security,'' <PERSON> Fenech </PERSON> <PERSON> Adami </PERSON> said in an interview Wednesday. `` Being a small country does not mean that security problems are larger,'' he said. `` In fact, on the contrary, being a small country, both as to the size of the country itself and the size of the population, can render security less of a problem.'' <PERSON> Fenech </PERSON> <PERSON> Adami </PERSON>, who met with Libyan Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> on Sunday in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> is in favor of the summit and objects only to it being held on warships in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. `` I see no special security threat,'' said armed forces commander Brig. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiteri </PERSON>. `` We've always had good relations with the Libyans. ... They have never given us any trouble and there is no reason to suppose they will this time. `` We have n't identified a serious threat from anybody,'' said <PERSON> Spiteri </PERSON>, who commands the security operation. `` But, of course, that can make security concerns more difficult.'' <PERSON> Spiteri </PERSON> said that if there were a specific threat against either <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> during the summit meetings Saturday and Sunday, authorities could look for it and plan accordingly. One senior government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said holding the summit aboard the guided missile cruiser USS Belknap and the Soviet missile cruiser <PERSON> Slava </PERSON> had added to security concerns. `` If the summit was only on land, you have just one restricted area to close off,'' the official said. `` But since the leaders will be moving on the island and staying on the ships, we will have to close off areas both on the land and the water.'' He said the government will close the port to commercial traffic _ other than small fishing vessels _ for the three days the leaders are in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, and close the air space above the harbor to private aircraft. For security reasons, the government has stopped work on a construction project inside the harbor that employed 800 workers, who still will be paid. <PERSON> Spiteri </PERSON> said one Maltese boat will patrol outside the entrance to the harbor and another around the two warships anchored in the center, keeping all pleasure craft and fishing boats at least 200 or 300 meters away from the cruisers. Soldiers will patrol the shoreline and seal off an area near the St. Luciano Tower, a 16th century watch tower built by the Knights of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> on a jagged cliff that juts out into the harbor at the point closest to the warships. Police plan to set up roadblocks and checkpoints near the harbor and close off some roads to the public. The security force will include <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>'s entire military force and most of its police, including an anti-terrorist squad of about 100 members. A source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the three-day security operation is expected to cost the government the equivalent of $ 150,000 in overtime costs, plus at least $ 400,000 from the closing of the harbor and <ORGANIZATION> Malta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freeport </ORGANIZATION> and from stopping construction on the terminal. `` We assume the Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governments obviously will cover the commercial costs and expenses,'' said the source. `` We do not expect that the two superpowers will expect a small country like <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> to bear the costs of a superpower summit.''

<HEAD>Some Farmers Getting Around Subsidy Limits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s watchdog agency says some large farming operations are successfully using highly complex methods to get around federal limits on crop subsidies. Despite recent reforms ordered by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, these farming operations have been able to dodge a $ 50,000 limit on federal crop subsidies and probably will continue collecting the fat subsidies again this year. The department's Office of Inspector General said 1987 legislation failed to effectively limit the use of `` multiple legal entities'' to avoid the payment curbs. Other loopholes were also cited. A new audit report released to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday included an example of how the curbs are circumvented: One operation reviewed by auditors in <LOCATION> Tunica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, created 51 irrevocable trusts in 1989 so as not to have payments reduced by further restrictions taking effect this year. The remodeled operation involved three joint ventures controlled by two intermingled families, which had included 43 `` persons'' in 1988. Auditors said the 43 `` persons'' consisted of six individuals and 37 corporations. Owners of the 37 corporations consisted of 11 individuals and one corporation. `` Seven of the individual owners were the immediate members of the two families -LRB- a father and two daughters, and a father, two sons and a daughter -RRB- that controlled the operation,'' the report said. If the complex arrangement had remained as it was in 1988, it would have collected no more than $ 700,000 in payments in 1989. But with reorganization, the operation is expected to collect as much as $ 1,431,576 in subsidies this year. `` One of the family members of this organization told us that the main purpose of the reorganization was to maintain the maximum program benefits,'' the report said. `` He said it became a challenge to see if he could get a trust established for all of the operation's full-time employees. He called it a profit-sharing plan.'' Although the reorganization was allowed by current regulations, auditors said the trusts are believed to be `` flow-through entities'' to avoid new regulations last year limiting a person's membership in more than three entities `` We conclude this because about $ 1.3 billion per year will be routed back to the seven immediate family members through management fees, equipment and land leases, and loans,'' the report said. The heart of the crop subsidies are federal `` deficiency'' payments used to make up part of the difference between a higher target level and a lower market price are supposed to be limited to $ 50,000 per person. As an example, last month's average corn price at the farm was $ 2.20 per bushel. The target price for 1989 corn is $ 2.84. `` However, our review determined that producers have found new, innovative ways to reorganize farming operations so that 1989 payments will not be limited significantly by the legislative changes,'' the report said. The audit report followed one sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> describing the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> inspector general's activities for the six-month period that ended Sept. 30. In that review, the excessive crop subsidies were noted among a number of abuses checked by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> investigators and auditors. The audit report released Wednesday dealt specifically with operations of crop programs handled by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The auditors checked five state offices of the agency and 14 county offices. In the counties, 822 of 7,424 farm operating plans were selected for preliminary review. Finally, 52 farms were chosen for in-depth analysis. No individual names were released. States and counties selected for in-depth review included: <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>: <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Crittenden </PERSON> and <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> counties; <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>: Butte and Kern; <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>: <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Natchitoches </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tensas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>: <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Soto </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Noxubee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tunica </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>: <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>. The review of 52 farming operations identified 12 that reorganized so that all entities _ which can be individuals, corporation, association, trust or other legal entities _ could continue receiving payments as `` persons'' under the program.

 The <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> lawyer who investigated the ethics case of former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> is rejecting a report that he unfairly lobbied <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members by taking them to expensive <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> restaurants. A new book on <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s tenure as speaker, `` The Ambition and the Power,'' contends that <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> `` routinely took committee members out to dinner at some of the most expensive restaurants in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'' as part of a calculated campaign to win his case. The book by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> free-lance writer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, published this month by <PERSON> Viking </PERSON>, contends <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> ran up a $ 150,000 expense account while seeking to curry favor with what amounted to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s jury `` That is absolutely nonsense,'' said <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, who is running for president of the <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, the top elective post in the county that includes <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. He said he did take several committee members out to lunch and dinner, but when he did, `` it was cheapsville'' _ the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> dining room or a low-priced <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> restaurant. The $ 150,000 figure represented food, lodging and other expenses for a staff of 10 people over a seven-month period, he said. `` The idea that some lawyer from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> could come out and schmooze 12 hard-nosed congressmen into bulldozing the speaker of the House ... defies any kind of logic at all,'' <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, during the two years he spent working on the book, was granted unusually broad access to otherwise private meetings of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership and meetings with staff and other lawmakers. He also obtained access to some transcripts from closed-door meetings of the ethics panel. In June, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> became the first speaker in history to resign under fire in mid-term after the ethics panel formally charged him with 69 violations of House rules. How much <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>'s lobbying of the ethics committee affected the outcome of the case will remain in dispute. Detailed expense records for <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>'s investigation are not available to the public. The records are kept by a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee chaired by Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaydos </PERSON>, D-Pa., who also is a member of the ethics committee Despite its sympathy with <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s plight before the ethics committee, the book concludes that the former speaker's downfall was largely the result of his own arrogance. House Republicans had long complained about his heavy-handed way of running the chamber, and they believed he overreached to take control of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> policy from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. By the time his ethics problems cropped up <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had become a lonely figure, estranged even from his own power base among Democrats. The book contrasts what it calls <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>'s conscious strategy of playing to the political side of the committee with what it portrays as a weak and inept defense of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> by his lawyer, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oldaker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Oldaker </PERSON> appeared not to recognize that committee members were worried about justifying their decision on <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to the public and the news media, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> writes. <PERSON> Oldaker </PERSON> once angrily quoted <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> as having told him, `` This case will be decided by the editorial pages of the nation's newspapers,'' according to the book <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, while contending that he never broke <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules, also seemed to believe that the rules should n't apply to him, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> concludes. A former close aide, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Raupe </PERSON>, once said, `` I do n't understand how <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> can be so politically in tune and then be almost totally blind to appearances,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> writes The book also contains glimpses inside the sometimes profane and rough world of leadership meetings. At one, members were discussing whether to assign a member who is Jewish to the Foreign Affairs Committee. Ways and <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., objected `` You ca n't put him there. There are already four kikes on that committee,'' he is quoted as saying. A <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> spokesman denied the statement was ever made, but <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said he was certain of the remark.

<HEAD>Abortion Rights Advocates Face Challenge in Parental Notification
Cases</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the battle for public opinion on abortion, a daunting challenge confronts those who say young girls should be able to obtain abortions without first telling their parents. The problem for abortion rights advocates is that most Americans view the issue _ now under <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> study _ primarily as one of parental rights. Many who support the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s 1973 decision that women have a constitutional right to abortion also favor parental involvement when minors seek abortions, public opinion polls indicate. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, after hearing arguments Wednesday in cases from <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, must decide whether states may outlaw abortions for most unmarried girls under 18 unless their parents are notified or a judge's approval is given. About half the states have such laws, although most of them have been blocked by court challenges. Those who oppose notification laws may be in danger of being perceived as enemies of parents and families. That perception has not escaped anti-abortion forces stung by the momentum their movement lost after July's <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision giving states more power to regulate abortions. `` It defies common sense to suggest that children should be allowed to undergo ... surgery without the foreknowledge of their parents,'' <PERSON> Ann-Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Lohr </PERSON>, an attorney with <ORGANIZATION> Americans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION>, said after Wednesday's high court session. `` The common-sense solution -LRB- is -RRB- that parents be informed of their minor daughter's medical situation,'' she said. <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Sogg </PERSON>, however, earlier told the justices that not all young girls have loving and supportive parents. Some young girls must be protected from abusive mothers and fathers, she said. Of the approximately 180,000 girls under 18 who obtain abortions each year, about half are accompanied by one or both parents when they go for the operation. Ms. <PERSON> Sogg </PERSON> argued that state parental notification laws likely do not affect such girls, but others who may be better off not telling their parents need to be protected from intrusive state regulation. Whatever the court says about parental notification laws, in decisions expected by July, will not necessarily endanger the 1973 <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision that legalized abortion. The consensus among lawyers on both sides of the abortion issue is that the justices will not use the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> cases as vehicles to reassess the 1973 ruling. But <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bopp </PERSON>, general counsel of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, disagrees. `` Roe vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> is on the table,'' he said. `` The court has to decide whether there is a right to abortion'' before saying whether a particular parental notification law violates any right. If the parental notification cases are to carry any impact for adult women, the words of Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> will be decisive. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, who as the court's sole woman never has said explicitly whether she believes an abortion right exists, controlled the outcome of last July's ruling. She has never voted to invalidate a state regulation on abortion, but seemed greatly troubled by <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s requirement that both biological parents be notified. The question is whether <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> could vote to strike down the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> law without stating, or at least implying, that it violates some constitutional right enjoyed by young girls. Four justices support the 1973 conclusion that abortion is constitutionally protected. Four justices appear ready to abandon that decision. If <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, a critic of the rationale used in <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, decides to articulate some alternative approach, she will have charted a new course for the future of abortion law.

<HEAD>Government Needs More Muscle in Substandard Medicare Care: Panel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Members of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee say the government needs more disciplinary muscle against doctors and hospitals that provide substandard care for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> patients. The recommendation was in a report Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that also criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> for a four-year delay in writing regulations to implement a law that gives the agency more power to punish health-care providers. The law, enacted in 1985, allows <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> to deny payment to hospitals and physicians in cases where substandard care is provided. The department is working on the regulations, said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Siebert </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. That agency handles <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>, the government health care program for 33 million elderly, blind and disabled Americans. `` They're fairly controversial and complex regulations,'' he said. `` We've spent a lot of time consulting with medical care industry.'' Physicians may be terminated from participating in Medicare or fined up to the amount of the care provided, but only in cases where there has been a clear pattern of incompetence by physicians who were `` unwilling or unable'' to improve their treatment. The report said the standard that must be met is too stringent because it allows physicians to escape punishment by agreeing to take an educational course to indicate their willingness to improve. It also said the monetary penalty is too low. HHS Inspector General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON> has recommended that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> strengthen the standard and raise the fine to $ 10,000 per case. The report, based on a three-year investigation by the panel's Human Resources and <ORGANIZATION> Intergovernmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION>, estimated that more than 800,000 errors are made each year by doctors and hospitals caring for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> patients The most common error was not having adequate discharge plans for post-hospital care, the report said. That was the case for about 3 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> admissions selected randomly and reviewed by peer review organizations in 1989, the report said. Extrapolating that to the 11 million annual Medicare admissions amounts to 330,000 failures. `` The large number of beneficiaries who may be at risk of inadequate hospital-discharge planning is of special concern to the committee due to fears that the <ORGANIZATION> PPS </ORGANIZATION> system -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>'s system for paying hospitals -RRB- ... is resulting in patients being discharged faster and less stable,'' the report said. Eight Republicans on the 39-member committee cautioned in an accompanying document that the error estimate was derived by extrapolating from reviews, called generic screens, that are designed to detect potential problems. An error can result from merely failing to sign a form in the proper place, they said. `` If an exhaustive look were taken at all generic screen failures, we are convinced the number of quality problems would be far below the committee report's projections,'' they said. Under the <ORGANIZATION> PPS </ORGANIZATION> system, or prospective payment system created in 1983 as a <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> cost-saving measure, hospitals are paid a flat fee for each treatment they provide. The fee assumes a certain length of hospital stay and medical services.

<HEAD>Pentagon Estimates $1.7 Billion Cut</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Pentagon estimates it will be forced to slash about $ 1.7 billion from its planned 1990 spending because of the effect of the Gramm-Rudman budget reduction law. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said Wednesday it was n't immediately clear what the exact impact of the cuts would be, or how they would affect manpower decisions <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> called the figure a `` preliminary estimate'' pending formal notification from the Office of Management and Budget. `` We're still trying to figure out how it's all going to fall,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. Had the terms of the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law been fully enforced over a year, defense programs would have been pared by $ 8 billion, or half the $ 16 billion spending reductions the law would have automatically imposed on most federal programs. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said repeatedly in recent weeks that he preferred retaining the across-the-board cuts for a full year to accepting congressional efforts to reduce the deficit, which he said contained phony savings. Pentagon officials had warned of severe cutbacks in military personnel and weapons acquisition if the Gramm-Rudman cuts had been left in place the entire year. The development comes as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed, with reservations, a bill authorizing $ 305 billion for defense programs for the current fiscal year, including a cut in his request for the Strategic Defense Initiative. The measure cuts $ 1.1 billion from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s $ 4.9 billion request for spending on the SDI program, or Star Wars, in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a statement that the measure would provide sufficient funds to `` provide a national defense sufficient to meet foreseeable threats to the national security'' in the coming year. The legislation represents the first cut in the SDI program in six years. The bill also trimmed his request for other major strategic programs such as the MX and Midgetman nuclear missiles and the B-2 stealth bomber. The legislation reduces the ceiling on the number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops overseas by about 15,000. Those troops were associated with intermediate-range nuclear weapons, banned by a U.S.-Soviet treaty signed in December 1988.

Despite <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s efforts, staffing problems caused by budget constraints threaten to undermine even the best attempts to rid the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> of mismanagement and political influence, Inspector General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said in the report issued Wednesday. `` The department and <ORGANIZATION> OIG </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Office of the Inspector General -RRB- face critical staffing shortages resulting'' from across-the-board budget cuts made under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said in his semiannual report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` Adequate staffing, continuity of leadership and management accountability are essential if the reform measures are to work,'' he said. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said that while it was premature to grade the substance of <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s efforts, the secretary `` has already taken aggressive corrective actions and proposed widespread reform measures, including the elimination of programs not benefiting the needy.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said the media and congressional attention <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> has received since April, when his report on a rehabilitation program riddled with wasteful spending and political favoritism was issued, have complemented <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s reform efforts. `` The positive aspect of the current situation is that it creates an environment in which needed reform can take place,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. `` While it is too soon to predict the reform actions' success, I will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of those measures. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, in a separate report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said his management team had resolved 97 percent of the nearly 1,700 internal audit recommendations awaiting management action when he took over <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> early this year. `` <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s management team is aggressively cleaning up problems which, over many years and during several administrations, have made well-intentioned programs susceptible to fraud, political influence and the waste of taxpayers' hard-earned dollars,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' report recounted the problems found in virtually all of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s major housing and loan programs _ fraud, waste and mismanagement with a pricetag estimated at more than $ 6 billion. The government, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said, could save millions if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would amend federal housing laws to allow refinancing of HUD-backed mortgages at today's more favorable interest rates. He renewed his call for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to grant inspectors general subpoena powers to force witnesses to cooperate with investigations. He warned that <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> _ often referred to as `` <ORGANIZATION> Ginnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION>'' _ saw its default portfolio grow from $ 3.1 billion to $ 12.5 billion last year, in large part because of bad real estate markets in `` oil patch'' states. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said the agency needs to increase its reserves to offset losses and take steps to reduce future defaults. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> acknowledged in his report that no steps had been taken to improve GNMA management, but said an analysis was underway. Since April, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> has recovered more than $ 25 million owed the government, implemented reforms that saved $ 21 million and committed itself to recovering another $ 50 million.

<HEAD>Testimony Shows Senators Didn't Influence Regulators, Riegle Says</HEAD>

 Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, voicing frustration with the controversy over the nation's biggest savings and loan failure, says news reports downplay evidence that he and four other senators did nothing improper. `` Very sensationalized stories have run, putting such a sinister colorization on this thing,'' <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., said Wednesday `` I resent it. I think it's unfair.'' He said little attention was given to sworn testimony by federal regulators that the senators did not influence the regulators' actions toward <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> Such testimony `` basically blows away the story,'' he said. <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, has said little publicly about his role in the battle between federal regulators and <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, which the government seized in April. Regulators estimate the thrift's failure will cost the taxpayers $ 2 billion, making it the costliest S & amp; L collapse in the nation's history The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has hired an independent counsel to examine allegations that five senators improperly intervened with regulators on <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s behalf. The senators are <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>; <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>. All the senators except <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> attended an April 2, 1987, meeting with <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, then chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> says the senators improperly pressured him to drop a regulation that would have curtailed risky savings and loan investments. <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> joined the other senators at an April 9, 1987, meeting with <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> regulators who were investigating <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>. All five received large campaign donations from former <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> owner <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> returned the $ 78,250 he received from <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> and associates In an interview, <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> voiced frustration over allegations that <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> bought the senators' influence. He said <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> and other regulators who testified before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> repeatedly said the senators did not influence them. `` They were absolutely clear-cut on that issue and they said it over and over again,'' he said. Some of the senators have described their involvement as a normal constituent service. <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, however, said he did not consider his attendance at the April 9 meeting a constituent service _ even though he had visited <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> properties in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> the previous year and <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> had purchased and renovated the Pontchartrain Hotel in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. `` I went as a member of the banking committee,'' he said. `` The responsibility for handling their situation was in the hands of others who had them as a direct constituent.'' He said he was confident the ethics committee would find that `` all my actions were entirely proper'' and that case would do him no long-term political damage.

<HEAD>Icahn Seeks Permission to Acquire 25 Percent of USX Corp.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Investor <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> is making another play for <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the giant oil, gas and steel concern. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, who announced plans to acquire sizable stakes in Pittsburgh-based <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> twice before, disclosed Wednesday that he is requesting federal approval to acquire at least 25 percent of the corporation. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, known for his past corporate takeover attempts, owns <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> finished down 12 -LCB- cents at $ 33.62 -LCB- in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading Wednesday <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s disclosure came after the markets closed. In a filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> revealed that he was seeking permission from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to increase his stake in <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> antitrust clearance for such an acquisition is required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> said the company was aware of <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s filing but had no comment. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> said, made similar requests in late 1987 and late 1988 but never boosted his stake to the amount requested with the allotted year. `` This is the third time he's filed,'' <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> said. `` This is a renewable thing.'' According to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing, made public just after 5 p.m. Wednesday, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> owned nearly 34 million, or 13.26 percent, of <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding shares of common stock. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> document noted that in November 1988, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> made a Hart-Scott-Rodino filing indicating his intention to acquire more than 15 percent of <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION>'s voting securities `` and, depending upon market conditions, more than 25 percent'' of its voting securities. But because his group did not acquire in excess of 15 percent within a year, a new filing is required to permit acquisition above 15 percent, said the filing. In the latest <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> said he was doing so under Hart-Scott-Rodino `` indicating that the registrants have a good faith intention'' to acquire more than 15 percent and up to 25 percent of <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION>'s voting securities. The filing said the acquisition was dependent on market conditions and redemption or invalidation of a `` poison pill' shareholder rights plan adopted by <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 10 in an attempt to ward off a hostile takeover The <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> plan would take effect once a person or group acquired at least 15 percent of the company's common stock. Under the plan, shareholders would be issued one stock right for each common share they already hold. The <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> board could give shareholders the option of exchanging the rights for common stock, at the ratio of one share of common stock for each right, thus increasing the number of shares a raider would have to acquire. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> has said the plan was designed to prevent someone from gaining control of the company without offering a fair price to all stockholders. In October, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> said his group was considering making proposals for `` business combinations'' with <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION>.

 Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, fresh from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, says Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is n't looking for miracles from <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, but deserves help from the West such as observer status at world trade talks President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> had a private dinner at the White House Wednesday night in the last of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s pre-summit consultations with leaders of the Western alliance before he leaves today for <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> and this weekend's shipboard talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, who returned Sunday from his own talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, spent nearly three hours at the White House before flying back to <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> thanked him profusely for coming. `` I ca n't tell you how much I appreciate your advice and your observations,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Then, in what the president acknowledged was `` a little unorthodox'' fashion, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> left his guest on the driveway to hold forth for Canadian and American reporters. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> defended <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> against charges that he has been too timid in responding to the fast-moving tide of democratic and economic changes sweeping the East Bloc nations. `` The administration has a responsibility to act with prudence,'' he said. `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and leader of the Western alliance, and it is important that he act not in haste, but that he act effectively. `` I believe that his intensive preparations and his very constructive attitude, I believe that this is going to bring about good results.'' <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said he recommended that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> be granted observer status at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks _ the discussions where the world's major industrialized nations lay the ground rules for international trade _ and that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> get a personal briefing after each economic summit of the seven major nations of the West. That briefing, he said, should be conducted by the chairman and host of the <ORGANIZATION> G-7 </ORGANIZATION> summit, which happens to be <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for the 1990 meeting to be held next spring or summer in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` What did President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> think of it? I think he kind of liked it,'' said <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>. `` My belief is that President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> looks upon the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> summit not with a view to any achieving any miracles, but with a view to building a sustained and solid relationship with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that will give rise to major accomplishments down the road,'' <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said, is `` in for the long haul himself. I think he's got an ambitious, progressive agenda for the future. `` Some of his suggestions are worthy of thoughtful and generous response, and on the basis of that, there are some gestures that can be taken,'' he said. There also `` might be a series of steps to bring -LRB- the Soviets -RRB- more closely into the INF and <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> ambit,'' the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> leader suggested. The meeting was the fourth one-on-one session this year between the two North American leaders. Also attending the private dinner were: Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>; <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>; <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, the national security adviser; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, deputy national security adviser; and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ney </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> was accompanied by Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>; <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartt </PERSON>, the prime minister's chief of staff; and <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Burney </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> conferred with <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> at Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, last Friday, and has spoken with other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and Western alliance leaders by telephone in advance of the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> summit. He has promised not to spring any surprises on the allies. Asked if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had assured him of no surprises such as former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s discussing abandoning nuclear arms with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Reykavik </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, in 1987, <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said, `` Oh, you can be certain of that.''

<HEAD>Thornburgh Ordered Prison Officials to Withdraw Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> ordered federal prison officials to withdraw a day-old plan to restrict press interviews of inmates just hours after reporters sharply questioned him about it. The attorney general faced angry questions Wednesday about his plans for new <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> guidelines being drafted to stem the flow of unauthorized information. During the tense session, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> defended the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal to limit each inmate to one press interview a month as part of `` what is necessary to properly manage prison facilities.'' But late in the day, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> abruptly and unexpectedly issued a brief statement saying he had ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> to withdraw the proposed regulations, which had been put out for public comment. The plan would have limited the number of press interviews at each prison facility to one a day. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> had also faced hostile questioning about a provision of the plan that would have empowered wardens to bar future interviews by reporters who failed to seek comment from officials about allegations made by inmates of mistreatment or other conditions. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koren </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> prison project called the provision a form of censorship designed `` to cut off any kind of criticism and to protect the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> from any embarrassments.'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> told reporters the regulations were designed to ensure an `` accurate flow of information.'' `` I think there is a problem that they are trying to address of reconciling their management responsibility with the flow of information in and out of prisons.'' But the attorney general said he had not personally reviewed the proposed regulations before they were published in Tuesday's Federal Register In his statement released late in the day, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said `` this proposal was submitted prematurely and without my personal review. It will be subject to further review before resubmission.'' <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> was told of the proposed regulations Tuesday night. He decided Wednesday afternoon to order them rescinded. He met Wednesday morning with reporters. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, chief spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> said there were only a few changes from current policy in the proposed regulations. He said the bureau has long required reporters to seek its response to allegations about prison conditions made by inmates. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said leaks of information about criminal investigations prompted him to order a full review this fall of press guidelines in the department and all its component agencies. `` I expect it to result in two things: one, that we will have some success in reducing the number of leaks of pending criminal investigations and, secondly ... that we speak with one voice on policy matters. `` It was ` let's leak like a sieve' when I got here,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. The attorney general repeated his warning that he would prosecute department officials who leak details of an ongoing criminal investigation. `` Those persons are criminals themselves because they violate the privacy statutes and the theft of government property statutes that the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has enacted.'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> has ordered investigations of numerous leaks, including a probe to identify the source who disclosed an investigation of alleged financial irregularities in the office of Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, D-Pa. The leak unleashed a storm of accusations from <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats that the disclosure was politically orchestrated by <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s aides while <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> was seeking election as <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority whip The department eventually issued a statement saying <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> was cooperating with the investigation and was n't a target. Asked Wednesday if he were satisfied the Gray leak had not come from his staff, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said: `` I have n't had an opportunity to review the results of the investigation.'' The review of department press guidelines that <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said he ordered earlier this fall has already resulted in new press guidelines at the Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> McNary </PERSON>, the new <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> commissioner, ordered all field offices to get clearance from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> before responding to a wide variety of press questions. In September, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> had rebuked <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> officials for confirming reports that <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents had arranged the sale of crack in a park near the White House at the request of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speechwriters. The president, displaying a plastic envelope containing the crack, told of the undercover sale in his televised speech to unveil his anti-drug strategy.

 Machinist union leaders are vowing to continue their strike against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Machinists President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kourpias </PERSON> said Wednesday that the union would try to pressure <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, and the bankruptcy court overseeing the cash-strapped carrier into a settlement. The union also plans to push Eastern to make overdue payments to its pension plan, which is owed as much as $ 1 billion, and take legal action against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> if the payments are not made. Eastern is strapped for cash and court actions involving the underfunded pension plan could affect <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to emerge soon from bankruptcy. <PERSON> Kourpias </PERSON> said the union would lobby <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to win enough support to override President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto of legislation creating a congressional panel to recommend a solution. Eastern pilots and flight attendants cited the veto last week in deciding to end sympathy strikes in support of the machinists, who walked off the job March 4 after refusing to grant more than $ 150 million in work-rule and other concessions. The union represents more than 3,000 Eastern employees who worked as mechanics and baggage handlers.

Democratic leaders viewed the proposed reduction as a windfall for the rich, the beginning of the undoing of the landmark 1986 tax overhaul and a deficit-increaser that would do little for the economy. They responded with a plan to liberalize tax-deductible IRAs, but withdrew that proposal when the capital gains cut failed.

 An large outdoor painting of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as a white man _ entitled `` How Do You Like Me Now?'' _ drew an immediate response Wednesday from a half dozen passers by.

<HEAD>Membership in All-Male Club Shouldn't Disqualify Dunne: Thornburgh</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> says the man whom President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to name civil rights chief should n't be disqualified simply because he's a member of an all-male golf club. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> refused to discuss former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON>'s expected nomination to be assistant attorney general for civil rights, saying `` that is a matter for the White House.'' But the attorney general dismissed suggestions Wednesday that <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON>'s membership in an all-male golf club would pose a problem. `` Mr. <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON> has indicated that if he is nominated by the president he will resign. So I think he feels it's inappropriate for the head of the civil rights division to belong to such a club.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Wednesday that <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON> was the top candidate for the job. Sources at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they expected <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to nominate <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON>, a personal friend of the attorney general for 17 years. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> refused to approve <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first nominee, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, after critics said he lacked professional experience for the job. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said membership in all-male clubs does n't disqualify candidates because `` we do n't believe in litmus tests.'' `` My objection is to a litmus test which says hat somebody because of any characteristic or any part of their background ought to be excluded,'' the attorney general told reporters. `` They ought to look at the whole record.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s weekend summit with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> should leave the superpowers `` better prepared to make substantial progress'' on a treaty to slash long-range nuclear weapons, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said Wednesday. However, he emphasized anew that no such agreement would be reached during the two-day meeting. In a pre-summit news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also said the democratic reforms that are bringing down <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s hard-line communist regimes are `` the only path to long-term legitimacy and stability in the region,'' and he warned against any crackdown by authorities While saying <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has not stood in the way of the stunning changes, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> declared, `` We firmly believe that any attempts to forcibly intervene and prevent continued reform will be extremely destabilizing and dangerous.'' He made a clear distinction between `` forcibly suppressing peaceful dissent'' and intervention by authorities to restore order, such as in possible ethnic violence in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` I see those as two distinctly different things,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. The secretary spoke on the eve of the president's departure for the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will hold talks Saturday and Sunday on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet warships anchored in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Marsaxlokk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, unidentified Soviet officials quoted in Thursday editions of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> told reporters <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also would focus on arms questions, with the aim of winning a commitment from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for rapid progress on nuclear and conventional arms agreements, including the establishment of a 1990 deadline for a treaty on strategic missiles clear statement <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spent Wednesday preparing for his first meeting as president with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, discussing the talks in a telephone conversation with West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the two leaders also talked about <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s new proposal Tuesday for a confederation with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> as a step toward eventual reunification. On that point, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, `` If there's unification, it should occur in the context of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s continued alignment with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and an increasingly integrated European Community.'' He ruled out any `` trade'' with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in which the two Germanys would be reunited as a neutral government. Mindful of some reservations among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he preferred a gradual, step-by-step process of bringing the two Germanys together. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also planned to discuss the summit at a dinner with Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>. At his news conference, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would complain to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> about what <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say is a continuing flow of Soviet-made weapons to the Moscow-backed government of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, as well as to leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` This pattern is a Cold War relic,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. Noting that Soviet officials have promised to prevent <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> from shipping Soviet arms to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, `` Either the Nicaraguans are lying to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is lying to us. `` We prefer to believe it's the former.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> meeting would not be an arms-control summit, emphasizing that no agreement would be reached either on long-range nuclear weapons or reductions in troops and conventional arms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. However, he said, `` this meeting should permit us to be in much better shape and much better prepared to make substantial progress, particularly on arms control'' at the full-blown summit scheduled next year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet leaders have expressed hopes of signing an agreement at that later meeting to cut strategic weapons, the deadliest arms in the superpowers' arsenals, by as much as 50 percent. This weekend, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, `` they will exchange new ideas but they're not going to negotiate and they're certainly not going to negotiate on anything that would involve our allies.'' The secretary also said the two leaders would discuss steps the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> might take to improve economic relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, such as waiving trade restrictions linked with Soviet emigration and possible Soviet participation in an international trading organization, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> prodded <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to waive the trade barriers, known as the Jackson-Vanik amendment. `` While I welcome the administration's offer to provide technical advice to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, I believe a more meaningful response is necessary,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> told a news conference. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> hailed warmer ties between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and said, `` We want reforms in Soviet domestic, foreign and defense policy to succeed, and ... we believe that the reformers are for real.'' In an acknowledgement that the changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will be accompanied by hardships for its citizens, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, `` We are quite realistic about the staggering tasks which face the reformers.'' However, he said, the important question for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is not whether <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms succeed or fail. `` The real question is this: Do you engage the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in a search for mutual advantage in this time of uncertainty? And our answer to that question is a resounding ` yes.'''

<TEXT>
 In his spacious apartment, <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhode </PERSON> reflected on the price of fleeing West: more than two years' separation from his wife and two sons, starting over in his 40s, and an enduring sense of isolation `` But I'd do exactly the same again. I do n't regret not waiting,'' said <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION>. `` We won three years.'' The pediatrician left <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> illegally in 1986, never expecting the Communist government would permit freedom of travel in his lifetime. `` Now I feel a tremendous pride that I did what I did. It was like moving a mountain with a shovel,'' <PERSON> Rhode </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> was among the East Germans who managed to escape before last summer, when neighboring Hungrary opened its borders and released a flood of East Germans to the West. On Nov. 9, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders gave up, scrapped travel restrictions and opened the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall. Among the new Westerners, many are young and hopeful, but some are disillusioned. Others, like <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION>, 44, simply are determined to adapt, buoyed daily by the memory of their desperation to leave <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think that anybody who has never lived there could ever understand,'' <PERSON> Rhode </PERSON> said. `` I did not want my children to wind up in their 40s in the situation we were in. It was like being a marionette, constantly manipulated.'' Despite the changes, including an amnesty for illegal emigrants declared in October, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> has no intention of going back and has not visited. He believes his children, now 14 and 16, have better opportunities in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. For two 23-year-old <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> secretaries who ducked out of a vacationing group in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and reached <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> in October, life in the West consists of sharing a room in a refugee center with three other women. They have never used computers and have little prospect of finding work or housing. In January, they are due to start a retraining course. `` It's disappointing,'' said one, <PERSON> Kirsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Senger </PERSON>, who left with her best friend, <PERSON> Katrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>. `` But if you want to succeed here, it's possible to fight your way through. On the other side, whatever you did, somebody always closed a door.'' `` If we'd known what was going to happen, I suppose we'd have waited,'' Miss <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>. `` But we'd have been the first through the wall on Nov. 9.'' Miss <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> went home to visit <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> soon after the wall opened, and Miss <PERSON> Senger </PERSON> also plans a visit soon. `` It was good to see my mother, because leaving her without telling her I was going was the saddest thing I've ever known,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>. Even with the hardships of adapting to their new lives, neither wants to give up. `` There was no hope'' in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, and authorities made promises they did not keep, said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>. After repeated applications, <PERSON> Rhode </PERSON>, who worked at a hospital in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> an der <PERSON> Oder </PERSON> along the border with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, got a five-day exit visa in 1986 to visit relatives in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, 50 miles away. His wife, <PERSON> Sabine </PERSON>, a neurologist, and their sons were not allowed to accompany him. The couple agreed that <PERSON> Rhode </PERSON> would not return. Knowing their telephone would be tapped and mail opened, Mrs. <PERSON> Rhode </PERSON> feigned amazement when her husband pretended to break the news in a telephone call. Secret police raided her apartment. She was fined 20,000 East German marks _ more than 10 times <PERSON> Rhode </PERSON>'s annual salary. Officials decided on the sum as representing half the state-assessed value of their property. Repeatedly, Mrs. <PERSON> Rhode </PERSON> was refused permission to leave. `` They were granting some applications, but highly skilled people had no chance,'' said <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION>. `` There were times when I thought it was hopeless. I promised her if things got too bad, I'd go back even if it meant a year in jail. Suddenly, on Dec. 28, 1988, Mrs. <PERSON> Rhode </PERSON> was told she could go that day. `` I just picked up the children, two suitcases and went,'' she said. In <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> had a relatively good living standard _ an apartment at a nominal rent, a car and more money than there were goods to buy. Their skills were in desperately short supply, while <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has a surplus of doctors. Some 1,200 doctors are out of work in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> alone, with numbers being swelled by emigres from the east. <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION>, a senior consultant in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, got a job as an assistant consultant at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Neukoelln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. It pays 5,500 West German marks, nearly $ 3,000 a month after taxes. He lived in a small apartment in the nurses' quarters, saving for the arrival of his family. They now live in their own apartment, which rents for $ 973 a month. Mrs. <PERSON> Rhode </PERSON> considers herself lucky to have found a job _ she works assessing accident victims' disabilities for an insurance group _ and both speak with distaste of what they see as a mercenary attitude of many of their West German colleagues. Mrs. <PERSON> Rhode </PERSON> said some had suggested she should feel guilty about leaving patients behind in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` They have no place to talk to me about feeling guilty,'' she said. `` Here we see them cheating patients by giving them unnecessary treatment.'' Her husband cited instances when, he said, doctors `` see a patient four or five times when one or two appointments would do.'

<HEAD>Interferon First Treatment for Hepatitis C</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Injections of the natural disease-fighting protein interferon give doctors their first effective weapon against hepatitis C, a virus that infects at least 150,000 Americans annually, according to a report today. `` In my opinion, this is a major clinical advance,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>. The work appears to represent another milestone in a year of advances against this elusive virus. Until recently, doctors were sure of only two hepatitis viruses, type A and type B. Since many people got hepatitis without exposure to these viruses, their disease was simply labeled non-A, non-B. In April, researchers from <ORGANIZATION> Chiron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Emeryville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, reported the discovery of a new hepatitis virus, which they called hepatitis C. They said it is the principal culprit in non-A, non-B hepatitis. They also described a new test that will reveal whether blood is tainted with the virus. Hepatitis C is the most common serious infection that is passed through blood. Perhaps 5 percent of all Americans who get routine transfusions become infected, although estimates vary widely. However, this hazard should largely disappear soon when the new screening test for the virus becomes available, perhaps next year. Most cases of hepatitis C are mild. About half those infected become long-term carriers, and 10 percent suffer cirrhosis of the liver. The latest research, involving 207 people, shows that therapy with alpha interferon, a human protein produced through genetic engineering, can temporarily shut down the virus' attack. The treatment stopped the destruction of liver cells in about half of those with chronic disease. However, in more than half of those who are helped, the disease returned when treatment ended. Researchers hope that giving interferon for longer period or in higher doses will hold the virus in check or wipe it out. `` This is a very common disease,'' said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. `` There has been nothing available for these people in the past. While this controls the disease rather than cures it, it is the first therapeutic intervention that has been offered these people.'' `` It looks promising that anti-viral treatment will be useful in this disease,'' added Dr. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoofnagle </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diabetes </ORGANIZATION> and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hoofnagle </PERSON> were co-authors of separate studies that reached similar conclusions about interferon's effectiveness. Both were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Hepatitis B is spread mainly through blood and sexual contact and is a major underlying cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer. Blood banks also test donations for hepatitis A, which usually spreads through contaminated food and water. While it can cause serious illness, people do not get lingering infections with hepatitis A. `` Hepatitis C virus is a vastly more common problem than HIV -LRB- the AIDS virus -RRB- and considerably more common than hepatitis B, for which we have been testing for 20 years. It's the most common serious virus infection'' passed through transfusions, said Dr. <PERSON> Lewellys </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>, head of blood services at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In another report in the journal, <ORGANIZATION> Chiron </ORGANIZATION> scientists teamed with researchers from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transfusion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> to strengthen the case that hepatitis C is the major, and possibly the only, cause of non-A, non-B hepatitis. They tested 15 people who got non-A, non-B hepatitis through transfusions and found that all were infected with hepatitis C. Donors were also infected with this virus. Just how many Americans get hepatitis C each year is unclear. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> estimates that about 150,000 of the 3 million Americans who get transfusions annually become infected. However, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> uses a far lower estimate. In an editorial in the journal, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s Dr. <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. Alter estimated that a total of 150,000 Americans get hepatitis C each year from all causes. Among these are 7,500 to 15,000 who catch it through transfusions. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> estimates that 40 percent get the infection through drug abuse. Other sources include on-the-job exposure to blood, sexual intercourse and household contact with infected people. However, in about 40 percent of cases there is no clear explanation of how the infection occurs.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s ringing rejection of reform is leaving him increasingly isolated as <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact allies move toward democracy. The supreme leader of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> renounced the reforms gripping the six other <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations at his <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s 14th congress last week. Instead, he proclaimed a strengthened role for the party, which already runs the most tightly controlled country in the Soviet bloc. `` The party can not give up its responsibility,'' he declared. `` It can not surender its historical mission to another force.'' Exppressing contempt for the political liberalization reshaping <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> _ whose 24 years in power make him the most senior <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> bloc </LOCATION> leader _ suggested that reform-minded <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders elsewhere had betrayed their people. The displays of orchestrated support from congress delegates did not gloss over the rapidly widening political gap between <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. He has often been at odds with the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, rejecting the Soviet lead in the 1970s at a time whent the rest of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact was in lock-step with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Now, he is resolute in rejecting reform. And in a new challenge, <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> suggested in his congress speech that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> give up control of territory gained through a pre-World War II pact with <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> that resulted in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> ceding <LOCATION> Bessarabia </LOCATION>, now <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION>, to its powerful neighbor. Distate for <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> was evident in the fact that several countries, including <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> ally <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, boycotted the congress _ a move which would have been an unheard of affront just five years ago. The growing isolation of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> also was reflected in the near-complete absence of the Western camp from the congress. Chiefs of Western diplomatic missions had attended past <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> congresses as a show of courtesy. But the 14th congress was boycotted by the 12-member <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, all 16 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations save <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, most Latin American democracies, and almost all of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s neutral counries. The issue was <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s poor human rights record, which was `` ignored back in the 1970s, when <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> was tweaking the Russian bear's tail,'' said a diplomat, who invoked the customary rules of anonymity. The Romanian leader's independent foreign policy decisions, such as refusing to join other <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations in invading <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in 1968, or defying a Soviet bloc boycott of the 1984 <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Summer Olympics, was met the with applause from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies. The cheers have turned to jeers, however. `` They're being very consistent, it's the rest of the world that's changing,'' Canadian Ambassador Sol <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> in the brightening rights picture in the rest of the Soviet bloc. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> is under growing attack for a rights record marred by severe travel restrictions, no freedom of expression and strict limitation on the practice of religion. Fear of opposing <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> even appears to extend into the highest party echelons, with senior officials seemingly restricted to carrying out the leader's decrees. Explaining the American decision to stay away from the congress, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said it would be `` inconsistent with the depth of <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> concern over the human rights situation in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, for which the <ORGANIZATION> Romanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> bears responsibility.'' Romanian officials deny that <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s refusal to embrace change is leading to international isolation and point to what they say are vibrant ties with the developing world. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> seems to turn to increasingly to developing countries, particularly those with a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> system similarly opposed to reform. Reporting on a meeting between <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> and Chinese chief delegate <PERSON> Qiao </PERSON> <PERSON> Shi </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Romanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <PERSON> Scinteia </PERSON> said both sides expressed pleasure over the `` upward movement `` and `` constant gowth'' of ties. Similar language was used to describe <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s meetings with the head of the North Korean and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> delegations.

 The rice was bugged, and we're not talking wiretaps. The sesame seeds had a problem, too. So did the apricots, the bean curd and the macaroni. In all, <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> said Wednesday, 15 of 17 imported foods his staff bought in the city and had tested at a private laboratory contained bugs or bug parts. At a City Hall news conference, <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> accused the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> of failing to enforce its food contamination standards. He also said the standards themselves are too low. Most of the foods he had tested _ including 2 ounces of Haitian milled corn with 26 insect fragments in it _ were within allowable federal standards. But six were so badly tainted they violated the limits, <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> said. Among them, he said, were a 5-pound bag of Indian rice containing one live bug _ a red flour beetle _ and 11 whole dead ones, including sawtoothed grain beetles and a rice weevil. There was a dead moth in the Chinese sesame seeds, a rat or mouse hair in the Chinese bean curd preserves and 481 insect fragments in the Greek macaroni. `` Had they been properly inspected, they would have been barred from sale in this country,'' <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> said. He blamed federal budget cuts under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration that reduced the number of <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> inspectors while food imports tripled. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> replied that it spends most of its time looking for food that contains microbiological contamination that could make people sick. Bugs, while unappetizing, generally do not pose a direct health threat, said <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Janiger </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> consumer affairs officer in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. `` We do screen for filth in food, but it's possible that some can get by us,'' <PERSON> Janiger </PERSON> said.

 Leftist rebels invaded parts of the capital's most affluent neighborhoods before dawn Wednesday, trapping many foreigners, and dug in after fierce combat with government forces. How many people had been killed in the latest guerrilla offensive was not clear. Eleven bodies of combatants were seen lying in the streets. Guerrillas briefly held a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy officer's home, officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said. They were also said to have seized the home of a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> diplomat. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> personnel were told not to report to work Wednesday, and the embassy was closed for the day, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Administration officials said no Americans were injured, and the rebels said in a statement that their fighters had been told not to attack Americans. A Salvadoran Foreign Ministry official said rebels took over the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, which is four blocks from the home of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, but <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> denied the report. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said guerrillas `` briefly overran'' a an unidentified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy officer's home. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the home apparently was seized at random. `` The family was safely evacuated by Salvadoran government forces, and the family was not actually in the hands of the guerrillas at any time,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Denny </PERSON>, a department spokesman. Heavy and sustained fire was reported blocks from Ambassador <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s home. Embassy spokesman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> was `` fine ... working in his office at the embassy.'' <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> said, `` Several families are unable to leave their homes because of fighting in their locations,'' which included the neighborhoods of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Benito </LOCATION>, Escalon, the capital's wealthiest. Late Wednesday, the rebel leadership proposed a six-hour truce Thursday morning to evacuate foreigners from the neighborhoods. There was no immediate public response from the government. In a broadcast by their clandestine <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venceremos </ORGANIZATION>, the rebels also said their fighters had captured the homes of three `` oligarchs'' but freed the occupants to show they are a `` responsible force'' fighting for `` democracy.'' Embassy spokesman <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said a charter flight might depart Thursday with embassy dependents who want to leave <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, and embassy personnel who planned to go home for Christmas would leave early. He said some dependents and other Americans had moved into the heavily fortified embassy in downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> to get away from the fighting a few miles away. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said there are about 8,000 to 10,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> at any one time. A <ORGANIZATION> Salvadoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said guerrillas took over the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and allowed relief workers to evacuate embassy personnel inside. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, a Foreign Ministry official said Japanese staff at the government's liason office in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> reported street fighting in the neighborhood. `` But there was no such thing as was reported'' in the press, the official quoted the report as saying. The official said no injuries were reported among people at the liaison office, which is in the former Japanese Embassy in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Consular and embassy business for <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> currently is handled by the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, he said. Another diplomatic source said guerrillas had seized the residence of a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> diplomat, but allowed those inside to be evacuated. He gave no details. A home about a half-mile from <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s house was burned after having been taken over by rebels. Whether rebels burned the house or it caught fire as a result of fighting was not clear. The guerrillas attacked working-class districts of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> earlier this month in their biggest offensive of a 10-year-old civil war that has killed more than 71,000 people, most of them civilians. On Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venceremos </ORGANIZATION> said: `` We're already sitting in the oligarchy's best mansions.'' A statement from the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel and buildings were not targets. Americans in the area should `` stay sheltered in their residences,'' and `` if they come in contact with our forces, they should identify themselves,'' it said. `` Our units have instructions not to attack North American personnel.'' Fighting began well before dawn in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Benito </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Escalon </PERSON>, the capital's wealthiest residential areas. Most people stayed inside the comfortable homes, which are surrounded by trees and 15-foot walls, as the chatter of assault rifles sounded in the winding streets. It appeared about a dozen homes were taken over by the scores of insurgents, who apparently came down from the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> volcano northwest of the city. `` By taking this part, we bring the war to the rich,'' said the leader of a rebel squad behind a barricade of cars with their tires shot out, arranged to block a tree-lined street. He said the guerrillas were beginning the second phase of the offensive launched Nov. 11. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said the rebels were continuing to `` make a symbolic and important statement about their ability to keep causing trouble'' through urban attacks, but posed no threat to the government. Soldiers and rbels fought for hours around the official and private residences of President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, both in <LOCATION> Escalon </LOCATION>. Reporters saw a light tank destroyed in <LOCATION> Escalon </LOCATION> by rocket-propelled grenades. The bodies of six soldiers lay around the charred vehicle. The bodies of at least five guerrillas were seen in <LOCATION> Escalon </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sultana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION> neighborhoods of southwestern <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, which also were attacked. Helicopters and spotter planes strafed and rocketed suspected rebel positions in <LOCATION> Sultana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION>, but not in Escalon or <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Benito </LOCATION>. Last week, insurgents briefly took over the blocks surrounding a luxury hotel in <LOCATION> Escalon </LOCATION>. They said <PERSON> Escalon </PERSON> was chosen as an objective because the government would not use warplanes in rich neighborhoods, as it had in the working-class districts of Mejicanos and <LOCATION> Soyapango </LOCATION>. Residents of the poor districts in northern and eastern <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> reported many civilians killed or wounded by air attacks. The insurgent radio also reported a mortar attack Wednesday on the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> in western <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The armed forces press committee denied that the compound, which also houses the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, came under fire.

 Ousted Communist Party chief <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> says he planned to bring democratic reforms to his country in December, and was simply overtaken by popular unrest that spread with breathtaking speed. The former hard-line leader said the massive daily demonstrations, and ultimately his downfall, were spurred by an erroneous report that police had killed a student demonstrator. <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>, 67, said he opposed the police brutality that sparked the mass revolt against his rule. Riot police on Nov. 17 clubbed hundreds of peaceful demonstrators in downtown <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. `` There's always some impulse or other'' to popular revolt, <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> said. `` Here the impulse was the events of Nov. 17. It was a tragedy.'' `` We did n't want such an intervention'' by the police, he said, claiming he opposed it along with the Interior Minister, <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kincl </PERSON>. He refused to say who was responsible. `` Then, the news about the so-called death of a participant electrified the students and set them in motion. This news proved to be a lie, but the landslide was already moving,'' <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> said matter-of-factly. On Nov. 18, rumors swept <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> that a mathematics student identified as <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smid </PERSON> had died when police beat peaceful students on a city street. Dissident <PERSON> Petr </PERSON> <PERSON> Uhl </PERSON> was arrested a day later for putting out the report, based on the statement of a woman who visited fellow dissident <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Benda </PERSON> and claimed her fiance, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smid </PERSON>, had died in the violence. The government frantically tried to shoot down the rumors, even showing two men named <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smid </PERSON> on television. <PERSON> Uhl </PERSON> publicly apologized for the false report at a mass rally on Sunday, hours after Communist authorities released him from jail under pressure from the opposition. By then, the anti-government rallies were attracting hundreds of thousands of people and events had spun out of the government's control Change had been coming anyway, said <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>, who spoke with three Western reporters Wednesday during a break in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, which amended the constitution to eliminate the Communists' 40-year monopoly on power. `` We were going to create space for democracy. But events moved quicker than we planned, so now we have to take these measures under more complicated conditions.'' <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>, smiling and composed, defended his record as party boss with the air of a man unable to drink in the momentous changes of the past 11 days. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, he said, had planned to introduce democratic reforms of its own at a December meeting of its policy-making Central Committee. But then the mass rallies forced immediate leadership changes and concessions. His claim echoes similar recent claims by many East German Communists that they had always favored change, but were blocked at the top. In both countries, citizens who remember four decades of broken Communist promises are skeptical of such statements. <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>, a Communist steeped in party work for more than four decades, seemed unable to believe that the party could lose power if it goes ahead with the free elections a Politburo member said Wednesday were likely within a year. The mass demonstrations of recent days `` have concerned only a small part of the country,'' he said, contradicting a report in Tuesday's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Rude Pravo that said `` every layer'' of society was involved in Monday's general strike called by the opposition. <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> said he favored removing the Communists' leading role from the constitution, a key opposition demand. Enshrining the leading role in the constitution `` damaged our interests,'' <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> said. `` Life has shown that it was not important whether the leading role was written down somewhere or not. What is important is how we win trust in life.'' <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>' admission was surprising in the light of his close links to the crackdown on reform after the 1968 <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion that snuffed out <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>'s glorious `` Prague Spring.'' For 21 years, <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> and other party leaders resisted the reform they were installed by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to suppress but which took hold of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power in 1985. <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> denied any responsibility for creating the current crisis in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, and also said Soviet officials played no role in the stunning events of the past week. While sanguine about what he called the damaged prestige of the party, <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> signaled the Communists are not going to cave in to all the opposition demands. The Civic Forum opposition movement has demanded <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>'s resignation by Dec. 10 But <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> said Civic Forum, as an unelected body, can not usurp this right from <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, which under the constitution appoints the president. He also opposed Civic Forum demands to disband the party's paramilitary force <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>, dumped from the ruling Politburo on Friday after the mass demonstrations gathered steam, was asked how he felt about the chants heard against him heard at the pro-democracy rallies. He sighed and said: `` I have always worked honestly my whole life, and I worked not for myself, but for society. You ca n't feel happy _ but this is what happens in politics.''

 The Playboy of the Western world arrived in the the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc today, unveiling <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women to a nation more concerned with shedding Communism. A Hungarian version of the men's magazine hit the stands today. Playboy debuted the edition Wednesday at a news conference that was the best attended since President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in July. The star attraction was December's Playmate of the Month, American <PERSON> Pia </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>, who told reporters she hoped she is `` recognized with clothes on.'' <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> apparently was chosen for the first East Bloc edition because of its liberal cultural and political climate. This year, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> disbanded and reform-minded leaders have promised free elections by June. In the maiden Hungarian edition, <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> wrote, `` The Hungarian people can now enjoy the same democratic freedom which <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> has always championed.'' Playboy, however, is n't likely to shock Hungarians the way it did Americans in the 1950s. The past year has seen a rash of soft-core pornography appearing at <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> kiosks. There are no pornography statutes on the books in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, but customs officials did routinely confiscate such magazines until 1983. The Hungarian edition of <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> will have an initial printing of 95,000 copies and will sell for 197 forints, or about $ 3, a steep price in a country where the average monthly salary is about 6,000 forints, or $ 100. The <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION>, a joint venture between <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and Hungarian entrepreneurs, will carry locally generated material as well as photo spreads and features from the American editions. Hungarian editor <PERSON> Dezsoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Futasz </PERSON> said there were no plans yet to feature a Hungarian Playmate of the Month because of the higher standards of photography available from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> edition. The Hungarian Playboy marks the 13th national edition and the 11th language in which the magazine is published, said <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stocken </PERSON>. During the news conference, a reporter from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> asked about a possible Soviet edition, to which <PERSON> Stocken </PERSON> replied that `` we are open to a business venture with the U.S.S.R..'' Miss December had a chance to clear up an error in the text accompanying her Hungarian debut: She likes leather and lingerie, not _ as the <LOCATION> Hungarian </LOCATION> text has it _ leather lingerie

<TEXT>
 Americans give <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> more credit than President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for lessening East-West tensions, and nearly eight in 10 believe the Soviet leader seeks true reform in his country, according to a poll. The Media General-Associated Press survey found suspicions of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s intentions fading rapidly, with a majority of Americans now convinced that the Soviets do not seek world domination. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who are meeting in a shipboard summit off <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> this weekend, won exceedingly high popularity marks, with roughly seven in 10 respondents rating each favorably. Their summit comes at a time of momentous change in the communist world. While <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> pushes reforms in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, his <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> European allies in recent weeks have moved dramatically away from political domination by their Communist parties. Forty percent of the 1,117 adults surveyed Nov. 17-25 in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> rated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as `` too cautious'' in encouraging reform in the Eastern Bloc; 46 percent said he was doing enough. The rest were unsure. Moreover, 41 percent said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has done more than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to ease tensions, compared with 29 percent who said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has done more. The others were n't sure. To encourage Soviet reforms, respondents by 2-1 favored establishing normal trade relations _ a step the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is exploring. A less likely move, foreign aid, was opposed by seven in 10. Goodwill toward <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> aside, the poll found lingering doubt about Soviet reliability. Fifty-three percent said the Soviets can not be trusted to live up to it arms control agreements, down from 61 percent in a poll last year but still a majority. Reflecting that cautious view, 52 percent opposed making significant cuts in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military spending because of lessened tensions. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is contemplating large cuts in its military budget. Similarly, respondents split on whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should remove all its troops from <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> if the Soviets removed theirs from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Forty-seven percent favored such a deal and 42 percent were opposed, a division within the poll's 3-point error margin. The rest were unsure. Respondents overwhelmingly opposed immediate cuts in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as a response to the reforms. But among those who were opposed, a majority favored reductions later if reforms continue. While the respondents favored continued defense efforts, just 35 percent said they believed the Soviets seek to dominate the world _ down from 50 percent who held that view in a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll last spring. Fifty-seven percent in the new survey rejected the notion that the Soviets seek world domination, with the rest unsure. Despite the split opinion on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s encouragement of communist changes, 74 percent approved of his overall handling of U.S.-Soviet relations. Seventy percent had a favorable opinion of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in general. Sixty-eight percent had a favorable view of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, virtually the same rating as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s and well up from 54 percent in a Media General-AP poll in April 1988, before a summit between <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was more popular than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ 85 percent to 65 percent _ among respondents with postgraduate educations. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also outscored <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> among this group in 1988. High regard for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> translated into a generally optimistic view of his chances for success. Among the 77 percent who believe he wants meaningful reform in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, 60 percent expected him to succeed, 15 percent said he is likely to fail and a quarter were unsure of the outcome. <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a communications company based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal, and operates TV stations <ORGANIZATION> WXFL </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, WCBD in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> WJKS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.

 On the eve of his release from prison in 1983, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> flim-flam artist <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sol </PERSON> <PERSON> Estes </PERSON> said his wheeling and dealing days were over. The problem was n't that he was crooked, <PERSON> Estes </PERSON> confided to a reporter, but compulsive. `` I'm just one drink away from being a drunk and just one deal away from being back in prison,'' sighed the former west <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> millionaire whose friendship with President <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> eroded after an historic fertilizer tank scandal in the 1960s. Now, at age 64, the state's most colorfully persistent con man is back in trouble, indicted with five others and a defunct corporation on charges of stealing trade secrets. He posted $ 10,000 bail Tuesday in <LOCATION> Brady </LOCATION> and was released along with three co-defendants. <PERSON> Estes </PERSON> dropped out of sight, and attempts Wednesday to contact him through friends and family were unsuccessful. In 1987, he moved to <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> from his longtime home in <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> McCulloch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> Attorney <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> said <PERSON> Estes </PERSON> and his associates face a Dec. 7 arraignment on felony charges of engaging in criminal activity _ a scheme to form a company with plans that had been stolen from another firm. `` The indictment sets out that he kind of came th the idea,'' <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> said. `` I've always been able to make money,'' <PERSON> Estes </PERSON> bragged in an interview in the current issue of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Monthly magazine. `` If I put my mind to it, I could make a million in the next 30 days.'' <PERSON> Estes </PERSON> went on to say: `` Me, I've never cared about money. I love puttials together and watching them run. For some people, money is death. You might as well give th a loaded .45 pistol and point it right at thei'' This is the <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sol </PERSON> who, after promis 1983 that his fast buck deals were a thing of past, outlined a grand scheme to corner the wirket by growing grapes in the west <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> desert ` We could, truly, move the wine business from Fr to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and I've got some people who woike for me to go out there and do that,'' he sa Now, he says, if he had money he would put itJapanese stock market. This is the <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> who once told a reporter: `` You can shear mb every year, but you can only skin it once.'' A running <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> joke is that it takes a gooindler to make millions peddling cow manure, bureat one like <PERSON> Estes </PERSON> to amass a fortune selling antom cow manure. And that's what got Estesble in 1963. He was convicted of federal ma fraud and conspiracy in a multimillion-dollar involving phony financial statements and non-exnt fertilizer tanks. The paper empire was propped up with federal agricultural loans, a cus arrangement that critics later maintained coulbe traced to <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sol </PERSON>'s ties with fellow <PERSON> Texaon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Estes </PERSON> was a <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> confidant anancial contributor as far back as <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s U. ays The extent of the relationship is debathe late president's associates insist it was nster bonding that <PERSON> Estes </PERSON> implied <PERSON> Estes </PERSON> wasom prison the first time in 1971 after serving years of a 15-year term. After being convicted o and conspiracy to conceal assets from the <ORGANIZATION> Intenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, his parole was revoked in 1979 ande was sentenced to 10 more years. He was red from the federal prison at Big Spring in 1983 While admittedly a dedicated swindler, the fliEstes is only slightly less interesting and decdly more noble. He is a tireless worker for thepoor and has used his own money and fund-raising abilities to feed and educate the needy _ black, white or Hispanic. He was an advocate of school integration in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> lore it was fashionable. <PERSON> Estes </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Mo that when he dies he wants only one thing on his tombstone: `` He did all that he could to help the poor.'' In the interview, <PERSON> Estes </PERSON> denied any wrongdoing in the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> affair but said: `` I suppose I'll be under investigation about one thing or another for the rest of my life.'' And what if he goes back to prison a third time? `` If I do, I guess that's part of my diny.'' Moments later, he added: `` Bring on the indictments. Let's fight. Tuesday they brought on the indictments.

<HEAD>Singh May Be Persuaded to Be Prime Minister, Colleagues Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Leaders of a centrist coalition seeking to form <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s first minority government said today they believe their reluctant leader will yet become prime minister. <PERSON> Vishwanath </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratap </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, head of the five-party <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> coalition </ORGANIZATION>, has maintained he is not interested in replacing Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. But his colleagues say he has no choice in the matter. `` He has to bow to the wishes of the people and the party,'' said <PERSON> Mohan </PERSON> <PERSON> Guruswamy </PERSON>, an associate of <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>. `` He has no alternative.'' <PERSON> Guruswamy </PERSON> said another contender for the post, <PERSON> Chandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shekhar </PERSON>, was persuaded Wednesday night to withdraw. <PERSON> Guruswamy </PERSON> claimed no one in the coalition would contest <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s nomination. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, who as late as Tuesday said he would not accept office in the new government, could not be reached for comment. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> resigned Wednesday after his <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> failed to win a majority in last week's parliamentary polls, but he was asked by President <PERSON> Ramaswamy </PERSON> <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON> to continue until a new government is formed. Results of 521 of the 525 seat at stake in the elections had been announced by today, and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> emerged as the single largest party with 191. Its small-party allies got another 17 seats. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> has 143 but has been promised support by the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Bharatiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has 88 seats, and by a coalition of left-wing groups, which won 51 constituencies. That would give the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and its tacit allies a total of 282 seats _ enough to carry a vote if there are no defections. The rest of the Parliament seats went to small parties and independents who have not specified whether they would support a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> government. `` Singh is not sure he will be able to handle a hung house,'' said a senior leader of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` That's why he was so hesitant to become the prime minister.'' `` <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was told he has no business to be in politics if he does not seek office,'' said another source in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, referring to meetings held by the coalition on Wednesday night. The National Front's <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> members are to meet Friday to elect their leader, who would likely be asked by the president to become prime minister. If the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> leader can not win a vote of confidence in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> _ which takes a simple majority of 263 _ he will have to resign as prime minister. Under the Indian Constitution, the president decides who will be asked to form a government. In past elections, one party always emerged with a comfortable majority. In the absence of such a majority, the president is free to choose the party he considers the most capable of forming a government. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has said it will not stake a claim to form the government. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> said he will lead the new opposition. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a former defense and finance minister, is the best-known leader in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. But the 58-year-old politician has said he just wants to be president of the <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dal </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the largest component of the coalition

<UNK>Greenpeace Stops Soviet Trawler Fishing In Antarctica</UNK>
<DATELINE>WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> activists in inflatable boats battled raging seas and freezing temperatures in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> today to stop a Soviet factory trawler from fishing, the environmental group said. It said three inflatables were launched from the <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> ship <LOCATION> Gondwana </LOCATION> stationed off <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, where the group claims the Soviets are overfishing. The group, in a statement, said the seven activists steered the inflatables on board the Soviet factory trawler Mikjail Verbitzkiy after a wild ride. It said the Soviet ship was attempting to put out nets when <LOCATION> Gondwana </LOCATION> approached and lowered the inflatable boats. The inflatables reportedly stayed with the ship for three hours despite 10-foot swells. The statement said <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> radioed the Soviet captain, in both English and <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION>, explaining the reasons for the non-violent protest. At one point, the inflatables actually landed on the stern ramp, blocking the trawling operation. `` For the last 20 years the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> ecosystem has been plundered by indiscriminate fishing, especially by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> area, and now these stocks are commercially extinct,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antarctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> Coodinator Maj de Poorter. She said the whole ecological balance was at risk, as the fish are food for penguins, seabords, seals and whales. <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>, as part of its campaign to have <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> declared a world park, is demanding a moratorium on all fishing south of the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> convergence until stocks have recovered. `` The great whales that once populated this area are gone, now the fish are going,'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Poorter </PERSON> said. `` <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> will not simply stand by and watch.''

<TEXT>
 Three weeks before the finale of the <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stones </ORGANIZATION>' `` Steel Wheels'' concert tour, <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> are proud of the band's new-found discipline, and its trainload of money. `` I've never seen the boys so serious,'' <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` Everyone is really conserving their energy for the shows instead of like 10 to 15 years ago when we would have, like, been up three or four days in a row. Things change.'' Since opening the 60-show North American tour Aug. 31 in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, the 25-year-old rock band consistently has drawn sellout crowds despite admittedly bad acoustics in stadiums such as the Metrodome in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. The Stones play there tonight for the second time. By the time the tour grinds to a halt Dec. 20 in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, more than 3 million concertgoers will have oiled the `` Steel Wheels'' machine with about $ 80 million. And that does n't count souvenir sales, corporate sponsorship from Budweiser and <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION>, a line of Stones clothing, album proceeds, and the multimillion-dollar payoff at the end of the tour from a live pay-per-view television concert with <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Clapton </PERSON>, Guns' N Roses stars <PERSON> Axl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> and <PERSON> Izzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stradlin </PERSON> and others. `` I'm very proud of the way it's financially run because I have a lot to do with it,'' the 46-year-old <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> said in an interview before Wednesday's show. `` But I'm also very proud of the fact that we do spend a tremendous amount of money on production.'' The overhead includes a 300-member entourage, stadium rentals <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> describes as sometimes `` unreasonable,'' and two huge stage sets loaded with pyrotechnics _ the larger of which will not fit into many stadiums. Asked about the accuracy of published estimates that each of the five band members will net $ 18 million, <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> said many of the estimates have been inflated `` twice or three times.'' `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is besot with money. It's always been besot by money,'' the singer said. `` People like juggling figures around. I certainly do n't know what the end numbers will be and if I did I certainly would n't tell you.'' <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, 45, said he's not bothered by <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s obsession with the tour's bottom line. `` The Stones have incredible timing. They've always had timing,'' <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said. `` Of course everyone has done very well out of it. But then, why should n't they? They are the best.'' The guitar player said `` Steel Wheels'' is the most demanding Stones tour he can remember. The 2 -LCB- - hour show is the band's longest ever and four shows a week leave little room to play, <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said In addition, a more complicated sound system is requiring the band to do a sound check before every concert. In past tours, <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said the band would do a single sound check at the outset and hope for the best the rest of the way. <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> credited the band's `` professionalism'' for a smooth tour. `` When you're doing 60 shows the challenge is after the first 20 to keep your interest up _ to keep the general standard high,'' <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> said. `` I think we've managed to do that.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s key index closed at a new high for the seventh consecutive trading day today, while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar declined moderately against the Japanese yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 247.33 points, or 0.67 percent, closing at 37,268.79. The index had gained 36.16 points Wednesday, climbing above 37,000 points for the first time. It rose today on small-lot buying on a broad front due to the yen's appreciation against the dollar and investor expectations of still higher stock prices, securities dealers said.

Volume on the first section was estimated at 1 billion shares, down from 1.61 billion shares Wednesday. On the foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at 142.90 yen, down 0.63 yen from Wednesday's close of 143.53 yen. After opening at 143.13 yen, it ranged between 142.75 yen and 143.18 yen. A currency dealer with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> said that after its low opening, the dollar remained stable because of month-end demand for the American currency.

 <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s conservative leaders have called for a complete severing of political and commercial ties with liberal-minded <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> in a volatile dispute that threatens to break up Communist <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. Western diplomats called the move Wednesday a possible first step in the disintegration of the state _ a loose federation of six republics and two provinces peopled by several different nationalities and religious groups. The nationalist dispute carries heavy ideological overtones: <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> to the east is controlled by hard-line Communists, while <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> to the north is led by liberals who back moves toward democracy and less state control of the economy. Tensions between the two republics have been heightened by sinking living standards as the federal government copes with economic troubles that have in the past year bred soaring inflation and, in turn, serious labor unrest. The Serbian <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, a Communist-led mass movement that serves as a mouthpiece for the republic's populist leader <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, issued the call Wednesday for all enterprises and organizations in <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> `` to sever all contacts with <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>.'' The move followed emergency measures taken by Slovenian authorities to block a mass rally planned for Friday by Serbian nationalists in <LOCATION> Ljubljana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>'s capital, who apparently hope to topple the Slovenian leadership. The rally was to protest purported harassment of the Serbian minority in southern <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> province by members of the ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> majority. The protesters claim the Slovenian leadership supports the ethnic Albanians. <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> is a nominally autonomous province, but <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> exercises some control over it. Friday's rally was called off soon after the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> announced the break. But many of the at least 40,000 protesters who were to have traveled to <LOCATION> Ljubljana </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> for the gathering had already left by Wednesday and could defy the rally ban. Their plans were not immediately clear. Wednesday was a holiday marking the 46th anniversary of Communist rule in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. The row brings to a head a long series of disputes between <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, which is setting up a multi-party democracy, and the <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> leadership, which advocates continued <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rule and a strongly centralized federal system. <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, the nation's largest republic, has repeatedly attempted to impose an informal economic boycott against <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, which is the country's most developed region. <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> contributes almost a quarter of the gross national product and a third of the exports of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, whose 24 million people include nine million Serbs and two million Slovenes. The <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>'s proclamation said Serbs will no longer allow themselves `` to be humiliated'' by a <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> in which `` all freedoms and human rights have been suspended.'' The statement described the Slovenian demonstration ban as `` a crime against justice and truth,'' adding that the Serbian people `` would not accept such an act.'' A news report on <LOCATION> Ljubljana </LOCATION> television described <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s move as `` senseless,'' saying the <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> leadership `` has sunk to the lowest possible moral and political level.'' The country's constitution in theory allows for its republics to break away from the federation. <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> recently adopted amendments to its charter explicitly giving the region the right to secede if the majority of its residents so desire. Slovenian politicians and the republic's vocal media have suggested Serbian leaders want to provoke a showdown to impose their own ideological orthodoxy on all of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and prevent the establishment of a multiparty system. `` The -LRB- Serbian move -RRB- is the result of <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>'s dictatorial policies,'' said a commentary on <LOCATION> Ljubljana </LOCATION> television. The dispute comes in advance of a January congress of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> that is expected to lead to constitutional changes that could grant country's member republics even wider political autonomy. The other four republics have introduced varying degrees of democracy over the past year while remaining on the sidelines of the conflict between <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Church Worker Says Salvadorans Threatened to Slit Her Throat</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An American church worker says Salvadoran authorities threatened to slit her throat after she was arrested at an Episcopal refugee sanctuary in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> last week. `` I was blindfolded, handcuffed, hit in the head, threatened,'' <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> <PERSON> Beecher </PERSON>, 37, of <LOCATION> Lopez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, said Wednesday. `` They said, ` Let's set the electric shock up; let's turn on the electricity.' They ran some object _ we were blindfolded, so I do n't know what it was _ across our throats and said, ` This is what's going to happen to you.''' Ms. <PERSON> Beecher </PERSON> was among 19 lay workers arrested Nov. 20 when the Salvadoran national guard raided <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evangelist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which was sheltering 400 refugees. She and five other foreigners were released within a day. But 14 to 16 Salvadorans remain in custody, according to the Rev. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>, the church's partnership officer for <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Beecher </PERSON> said at a news conference that she had been helping to feed and shelter refugees brought to the church by the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> when the national guard arrived at 5:45 a.m., searched the area and removed the lay workers. She was taken first to the national guard headquarters, then to the offices of the treasury police, where the abuse occurred, she said. Ms. <PERSON> Beecher </PERSON> said she was accused of being a terrorist. `` There's no way that I or anybody else in the churches are doing that kind of work,'' Ms. <PERSON> Beecher </PERSON> said. After first refusing to sign a release form which stated she had not been physically or psychologically mistreated, Ms. <PERSON> Beecher </PERSON> said she was advised by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consular official named <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> to agree to the clause. She did so and was released. She said consular officials later told her `` what I had received was normal treatment for a prisoner of war and that they did n't see any problem with that.'' Episcopal Presiding Bishop <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> said he has requested a meeting with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and will send four bishops to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> on behalf of the remaining church workers, including the Rev. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON>, rector of St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> the Evangelist. A statement signed Wednesday by nine religious leaders, including <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has not done enough to change the Salvadoran government. `` The focus at this moment must be on the immediate cessation of hostilities directed at the churches, including the release of all those now being held in detention,'' the statement said. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> the Evangelist was one of at least seven churches or church schools in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> raided by security forces on Nov. 19 and 20. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> blamed the raids on `` overly aggressive security forces'' and suggested President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> was having `` management control problems'' with extremist elements of his government. Two weeks ago, six Jesuit priests, including the rector and vice rector of the country's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, were slain. Fellow Jesuits blamed the killings on government soldiers, and the government promised to investigate.

<HEAD>Cities Ask Feds to Cough Up Anti-Drug Money</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The National League of Cities says it wants the federal government to stop talking about giving money to help battle drugs and start passing it out. The organization representing 1,400 municipalities wrapped up its five-day convention Wednesday by also asking the federal government for more help in dealing with AIDS, adopting a policy supporting a ban on automatic assault-type weapons and calling for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolen </PERSON> was elected president of the organization for 1990. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> continues to enact anti-drug legislation without providing significant resources to our cities, the level of government that deals most directly with our young people,'' said a resolution passed by league delegates. The resolution asked for $ 3 billion for local anti-drug efforts. The chief components of the increased federal funding should be treatment and education programs for young people, the resolution said. In a policy statement, the league said anti-drug efforts should include programs aimed at reducing abuse of `` legal drugs,'' such as alcohol and cigarettes. In other business, the league called on cities to adopt anti-discrimination measures regarding people with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, but said local officials can give little concrete help to AIDS victims unless the government provides more financial support. `` Unless the federal government plays a major financial role in the national public health emergency of AIDS, the state and local governments' hands are tied,'' the organization said. The league also urged a ban on the manufacture, sale and importation of all automatic and semi-automatic assault-type weapons, except for the military and police. The league further called for a 30-day waiting period for the purchase or transfer of all guns. Previous league policy supported only a ban on the sale or criminal use of armor-piercing handgun bullets. A motion to amend league policy to support registration of all guns failed. On <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the organization approved a resolution criticizing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy of `` constructive engagement'' toward apartheid. The resolution backed federal sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s government and urged cities to withdraw funds and cease investment in that nation.

<HEAD>Central Park Rape Victim Returns to Work</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The jogger who was raped, beaten and left for dead in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> seven months ago has gone back to work as an investment banker, and a relative said she's `` as sharp as she ever was.'' The 29-year-old woman, who has undergone physical and emotional rehabilitation since the April 19 attack, returned full time Monday to her job at <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a court source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. She was assigned to advising large corporations on investments. `` I'm sure they're not going to overload her,'' the source said Wednesday. `` The doctors were very concerned about the effect of stress on her.'' A spokesman for <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that the woman returned to work this week `` on a limited basis.'' Her name has not been published because of the crime's nature. The woman's aunt told WABC-TV: `` She has no animosity. She has the determination that ` I'm going to make it,' and she's thankful.'' The aunt, in silhouette on the Wednesday broadcast, said the jogger has no memory of the attack, `` and hopefully it will never come back.'' `` She's as sharp as she ever was, I think ... and in conversation, in her grasp of what's going on in the world, she is very cognizant of world events,'' the aunt said. As the woman returned to work, six youths who allegedly assaulted her appeared in court for a pretrial hearing on whether statements they gave to police after their arrests should be permitted as evidence at their trials. Defense lawyers say the statements were illegally acquired. The woman was discovered early on April 20 in a wooded area off <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>'s 102nd Street transverse. Authorities said she had been attacked hours earlier, while jogging at night, by a gang of `` wilding'' youths. The gang beat and raped her and left her. When found, the woman had lost most of her blood and was suffering from hypothermia. Doctors, initially guarded in their prognoses, have called her recovery remarkable. Before the attack, according to friends and colleagues, the woman often began working at 7:30 a.m. and spent up to 12 hours in the office. A native of a <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> suburb, she was released earlier this month from a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> rehabilitation hospital. She has moved from her <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> apartment to lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, the source said. The source also said the woman has resumed jogging, accompanied by relatives and friends. She has told prosecutors she is eager to testify at the trial of the six youths accused of attacking her.

<HEAD>Game Officials Seek Shorter Bear Hunting Season</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hunters are killing too many bears in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, say game officials who want to cut the three-month season by four weeks. The black bear head count likely will reach a record 2,700 by the end of the season Thursday, said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The harvest has been creeping upward since 1985, when 1,533 were shot, to 2,651 last year. <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> currently has an estimated 17,000 to 20,000 bears, department biologist <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Elowe </PERSON> said. The optimum level is 21,000, <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said. `` Our -LRB- bear -RRB- population is by no means in trouble,'' said <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, who noted the state still has the largest bear population east of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. But if the population is to get back to the target, the seasonal harvest must be cut to no more than 2,100, he said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Vail </PERSON>, the state fish and wildlife commissioner, said `` the increasing harvest trend is likely setting the stage for further and more dramatic declines in the population.'' <LOCATION> Vail </LOCATION> wants to eliminate four weeks of bear hunting in 1990 and 1991. Bears roam every section of the state except the more heavily populated southern coastal region, <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said. When food is scarce, usually in the summer when they are eating the most, bears occasionally wander into towns and dumps looking for food. They have been known to peer inside screen doors in the northern <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> hunting outpost of <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, and as many as three have been spotted within the city limits of the state capital, <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>, within a single summer, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Fournier </PERSON>, spokesman for the game department. But black bears are intelligent and secretive and no easy prey for hunters, <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said. The bears normally weigh 250 pounds fully grown and occasionally weigh more than 500 pounds, yet they are surprisingly quick, he said. Officials say bear hunters also may be attracted by what they see as a macho experience. `` They know they can come to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and have a quality hunt,'' said <PERSON> Fournier </PERSON>. Officials do not know exactly how many bear hunters there are in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, since the state does not issue special bear permits. `` But the word we get from the field is that they're getting in each other's way a little more,'' <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said. The state has scheduled three public hearings in December to get reaction from hunters, guides and others to the proposal to shorten the hunting season.

<HEAD>Passengers Praise Pilot for Easy Landing With Crippled Jet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Passengers who cowered in the rear of an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet as it hobbled in on two of its three sets of tires felt death was certain but said the landing was smoother than others they experienced. Some were so relieved, they raced off the crippled <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 for connecting flights at <LOCATION> Hartsfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. ` I figure it ca n't possibly happen to another plane tonight, so I'm going on,'' said <PERSON> Jahnn </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Saratoga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, who was making her first flight Wednesday. Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON> said none of the 43 passengers and seven crew members were injured. The right main landing gear jammed while retracting after takeoff from <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> Eastern officials said it appeared a damaged tire tread jammed the extending mechanism when it separated from the tire during the takeoff. After talking with ground technicians, the pilot, Capt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundrant </PERSON>, circled the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> airport, moving from side to side and up and down in an attempt to shake the landing gear loose. `` I was terrified,'' said <PERSON> Erika </PERSON> <PERSON> Celella </PERSON>, 33, of <ORGANIZATION> Ballston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spa </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` They told us all to get to the back of the plane, then they screamed ` Take any seat!' and I knew we were all dead.'' With less than one-third of the plane's capacity of 149, the passengers could fit in the tail of the plane, where they crouched, heads down and arms over their heads. Mrs. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said children cried, their parents prayed and many `` kept muttering ` Oh, my God, oh, my God,'' as the jet approached the runway. But to everyone's astonishment, the landing was `` smoother than a regular landing,'' said <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, who was traveling with her three children, ages 9, 2, and 8 months. `` I could n't believe how easy he set it down. It was better than most normal landings I've been through,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfree </PERSON>, who was traveling with her 3-month-old daughter, <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>. `` It made a little more noise, but that's all.'' The right wing touched the ground as it rolled to a stop, causing only minor damage, said <PERSON> Arlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Salac </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. Bundrant, 51, an Atlanta-based pilot with 23 years' experience at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, brought the plane to a screeching, grinding halt amid a shower of fire-suppressing foam from fire trucks. Ms. <PERSON> Celella </PERSON> said flight attendants `` were screaming ` Get out! Get out!' and we could smell chemicals that we thought was fuel, but was really the foam. We thought it was going to blow up.''

 A man who killed a state trooper as a teen-ager won a ninth stay of execution when the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said it needed more time to decide whether to hear his formal appeal. <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON> <PERSON> Prejean </PERSON> was to have died today in the electric chair for the second murder he committed as a teen-ager _ the 1977 shooting of <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleveland </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> was the only <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> state trooper ever murdered while on duty. <PERSON> Prejean </PERSON> was 17 when he shot <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> in the face after being stopped for driving with a broken tail light. <PERSON> Prejean </PERSON> had been freed six months earlier from a juvenile detention center where he served time for killing a taxi driver when he was 14. He would have been the first person executed after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling in June that authorized executions of people who commit capital crimes while they were 16 or 17. <PERSON> Prejean </PERSON>, 9 days from his 30th birthday, has been on <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s Death Row longer than any other inmate Just eight hours before his scheduled execution, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said it needed more time to decide whether to hear <PERSON> Prejean </PERSON>'s formal appeal to set aside his death penalty No date has been set for the court's action on the appeal. On Tuesday, Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> rejected the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pardon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s 3-2 recommendation that <PERSON> Prejean </PERSON>'s sentence be commuted to life imprisonment Soon afterward, the 5th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> denied a ninth stay of execution. Death penalty opponents made <PERSON> Prejean </PERSON>'s case a national cause celebre, saying he should be spared because he was nearly retarded with an IQ of 76 and because he was so young when he killed the trooper. The 5th Circuit said he is not retarded under standards of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retardation </ORGANIZATION>, which sets the threshhold at an IQ of 70. <PERSON> Prejean </PERSON> would have been the 19th person executed in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld the death penalty in 1976.

<HEAD>Suspended Navajo Chairman Arraigned on Criminal Counts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Suspended Navajo Chairman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> has pleaded innocent to 107 criminal counts, but his son, also facing tribal charges, failed to appear for his arraignment. Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazzie </PERSON> of the tribe's <ORGANIZATION> Window </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected the prosecution's motion for a $ 400,000 bond and released the elder <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> on his own recognizance Wednesday. A prosecution request that <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> be required to surrender his passport also was denied. <PERSON> Yazzie </PERSON> did not set a trial date, but tentatively scheduled a pretrial hearing for Jan. 29. Meanwhile, special prosecutor <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Donatelli </PERSON> said he would apply today for an arrest warrant to have <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, brought to the reservation. The elder <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, the leader of the nation's biggest Indian tribe, was charged Oct. 11 by special prosecutors hired by the tribe with 107 offenses, including conspiracy, bribery, fraud, extortion and election-law violations. The 60-year-old <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, who was suspended by the <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in February, also is the target of a federal grand jury investigation in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and a defendant in a multimillion-dollar lawsuit filed by the 225,000-member tribe in a state court. The lawsuit and most of the criminal charges focus on the tribe's 1987 purchase of an <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> ranch for $ 7.2 million more than the sellers had paid for it minutes earlier. Suspended vice chairman, <PERSON> Johnnie </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, and <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>'s son also were charged <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> pleaded innocent Nov. 17 to 15 election-law violations. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Benally </PERSON>, an attorney for the younger <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, filed a motion on Wednesday asking that the charges be dismissed. <PERSON> Benally </PERSON> challenged the tribal court's jurisdiction, noting that his client has lived recently in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. In seeking a $ 400,000 bond for the elder <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, special prosecutors said he was a flight risk and posed a danger to the community. `` <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> may take this opportunity to flee the country and get at money in foreign countries,'' <PERSON> Donatelli </PERSON> said. `` The time for him to leave the country is quickly disappearing.'' <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> scoffed at the prosecution's contention. `` I'm a good citizen of the Navajo nation,'' he said. `` I have no plans to take a flight anywhere.'' Allegations emerged in testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Indian Affairs in January that <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> personally profited from the tribe's purchase of the Big Boquillas Ranch from <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracey </PERSON>, two longtime friends of <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>'s. The tribe paid $ 33.4 million for the ranch within minutes after <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tracey </PERSON> had purchased it for $ 26.2 million. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel that <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> received $ 50,000 plus vacation trips and lease of a BMW automobile. In August, the tribe filed a $ 24 million lawsuit in state court against <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> and others over the ranch purchase. The 88-member Tribal Council placed <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> on administrative leave in February, following the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearings.

<HEAD>Indiana Bat Derails $6 Million Lake Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FISHHOOK, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A $ 6 million lake project was derailed after state officials discovered the site harbored roosts for the endangered <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> bat. The state called a halt to the recreation project after the discovery of 39 <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> bat roosts at the 800-acre lake site, officials said Wednesday. Previously only three trees in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were known to serve as roosts for the winged mammals in the summer, when they give birth. `` This project would have a devastating impact on this species of bat,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Garner </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION>'s endangered and threatened species conservation program. <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> said Wednesday that 12 roosting sites, or trees, would have been lost if the lake was built. The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> bat, very similar to the common `` little brown bat,'' feeds strictly on insects, <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> said. Male Indiana bats summer in a variety of eastern <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> locales, he said. But the females roost and give birth in only a few spots. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> bats return each year to the same nest as long as it remains undisturbed, he said, and anywhere from a dozen to a hundred bats will roost in a single tree. `` They have a tendency to roost in trees which have bark that flakes away,'' <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> said. `` They climb underneath the bark and have their babies. It's one of their most unique characteristics.'' Seven caves _ in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> _ provide winter shelter for 90 percent of the estimated 350,000 surviving <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> bats, officials have determined. Each cave is federally protected against private or public development. Concerns about the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> bat also were cited during federal consideration of sites proposed in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> for the multibillion-dollar superconducting super collider project, eventually awarded to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> and his staff pinpointed the roosts near the proposed lake project in western <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> by stringing nets across <LOCATION> Fishhook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> to catch the bats as they flew upstream. Each bat was fitted with a miniature radio transmitter that led scientists back to their roosts. The lake project would have expanded Siloam Springs State Park by 2,400 acres and created an 800-acre lake. State Rep. <PERSON> Jeffery </PERSON> <PERSON> Mays </PERSON>, who proposed the project, said the 3,300-acre park does not have a suitable site for a large lake, and its 56-acre lake is silting in and has n't been stocked in 20 years. `` It's a beautiful park, but it needs a decent-sized lake to really get things going,'' <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> said. `` I envisioned a lodge and camping facilities ... But that's history now.'' It was not the first time a project has been stalled for conservation reasons. In 1973, the snail darter stalled <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>'s massive Tellico Dam project for six years after the discovery of the tiny fish in the <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The discovery of what officials believed to be a bomb inside a suitcase headed for a Colombian jetliner turned out to be a video game bought as a Christmas gift. Only after the suitcase was blown up by a police bomb squad did experts determine that the suspected explosive device was a video game. And the owner is angry. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said the game was a Christmas gift for his nephews in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. He said his niece was taking the suitcase that also contained Christmas cards, other gifts and money, on a Christmas trip to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. `` I asked why they had to blow it up,'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said. `` They did n't have to. The name, address and phone for my niece were on the suitcase. They could have just called and asked someone what was inside. We would have opened it up.'' But Lt. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>, the bomb squad's commanding officer, said there was `` nothing to snicker about'' in the handling of the incident. `` You never know what you're going to find,'' <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> said. `` So on every call, we always assume it's a dangerous device.'' Early Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> detected what appeared to be sticks of dynamite, wiring and a clock inside a large, heavy suitcase destined for an <ORGANIZATION> Avianca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jetliner headed for <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. Experts then examined the detonated contents of the bomb squad canister and found the device to be a <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> game. Concern about possible bombings of Colombian airliners has risen because drug traffickers are waging a campaign of bombings and assassinations in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> country in retaliation for heightened enforcement efforts to curtail their trade. All 107 people aboard an Avianca jet were killed earlier this week when it exploded near the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> capital <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. Initial reports, later dismissed by investigators, placed blame for the crash on terrorists. A spokeswoman for Avianca, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s national airline, said there were tightened security measures in place since Monday's crash `` There is no confirmation on what caused the downing of that jet,'' spokeswoman <PERSON> Cecelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Battista </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Security has always been tight but it is even tighter now.'' The suitcase carrying the suspicious-looking device was set to be loaded on a Bogota-bound jetliner. Customs officials will reimburse the owners of the exploded suitcase, police said.

<TEXT>
 The father of one of <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>'s 16 mutilation-murder victims yelled `` Burn in hell'' after a judge sentenced the serial killer to die in the gas chamber. The judge also vented outrage Wednesday at <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>, 44, who prosecutors said picked up young male hitchhikers between 1972 and 1983, gave them drugs and alcohol, sexually tortured or mutilated them and then strangled them. `` He demonstrated an unbelievable, aggressive, violent tendency toward humanity. I just ca n't imagine this violence to satisfy his sexual desires,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartin </PERSON>. `` If anyone ever deserved the death penalty, he's got it coming,'' <PERSON> McCartin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> played with his pen cap, yawned, laughed and chatted with his lawyer during the sentencing hearing. After being sentenced, <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> briefly addressed the court. `` I have not murdered anyone and I believe a reasonable review of the record will show that,'' said <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>, a computer consultant from <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. But Juror <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldfarb </PERSON> said the evidence in the case `` was more horrible than any horror movie, because it was real. Yet at times, it was so unimaginable that it was hard to believe it was real.'' <PERSON> Darwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> could not contain his rage at the man convicted of murdering his 22-year-old son, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>. `` Burn in hell, <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>!'' the elder <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> screamed as his son's killer was led from the court Victims' relatives who endured six years of trial procedures after <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>'s arrest cried and hugged each other outside the courtroom. They wondered how <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>, who prosecutors said tortured one victim with a cigarette lighter before castrating and strangling him, could appear so indifferent in court and maintain his innocence. `` I saw the evidence. I guess we all know the evidence,'' said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, whose 18-year-old son <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> was one of <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>'s victims `` I do n't know how he could sit there and say it other than -LRB- because -RRB- he wants to make appeals. `` It just show you how pathologically a liar, a Doctor <PERSON> Jekyll </PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, he is.'' The judge made a similar observation. `` I sat here for a year, and I did n't see any remorse, feelings or regret,'' <PERSON> McCartin </PERSON> said. `` It seemed he was in another world during this trial.'' <PERSON> McCartin </PERSON> assessed the death penalty for 11 murders and consecutive life prison terms for the other five murders, saying that would ensure <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>'s imprisonment in case all the death sentences were somehow overturned. A death sentence is automatically appealed to the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> also was sentenced to 10 years in prison for three counts of sodomy, four counts of mayhem and three counts of great bodily injury.

<UNK>Dollar Higher In Quiet Trading, Gold Falls</UNK>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar rose against most major currencies in early European trading today, with some analysts predicting it would move higher and others saying it was only pausing momentarily before resuming its downward trend. Gold prices fell sharply but were recovering from their overnight lows on a wave of fresh buying. Foreign exchange dealers attributed the dollar's firmer tone to tighter <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates and a lull in the West German mark's upward climb `` What's happening is that the mark was being overbought and this has slowed slightly,'' one <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> trader said. `` At this point, it's the mark that's moving everything, not the dollar.'' Many <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> dealers said the dollar will continue to move lower against the mark in coming days, but some traders said the market may now try to test the dollar's upside. `` I personally believe the short-term outlook is bullish,'' said one trader at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. `` I think the next move is up. People have been buying overnight.'' News that <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON> was killed in a bomb attack early today was spreading through the markets but did n't have any impact on the mark or other currencies, dealers said. `` Certainly it raises concerns about internal security and public order, but the world is focused on issues of wider implication in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' one trader said. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.63 yen to a closing 142.90 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at a lower rate of 142.65 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday: _ 1.7890 West German mark, up from 1.7825 _ 1.5960 Swiss francs, up from 1.5895 _ 6.1025 French francs, up from 6.0810 _ 2.01855 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0100 _ 1,318.50 Italian lire, up from 1,315.50 _ 1.1645 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1658 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar It cost $ 1.5680 to buy one pound, more expensive than $ 1.5655 late Wednesday. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 406.20 a troy ounce, down from $ 412.50 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a higher recommended price of $ 406.80 In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 406.75, down from $ 411.70 bid late Wednesday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 5.59 to close at a bid $ 405.76.

 Police Department telephones were used to place $ 58,000 in calls to sex, dating, sports and horoscope specialty lines in the first nine months of this year, officials said. But they said steps have been taken to block such calls in the future, and an internal investigation has begun to find out who made the calls. `` We take this problem very seriously and we intend to seek full reimbursement from the officers and civilian police employees responsible,'' said Inspector <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayronne </PERSON>. `` If we do n't get the money, we will be forced to take action,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Amarosa </PERSON>, police director of communications. The calls were discovered after an audit. <PERSON> Amarosa </PERSON>, who ordered the audit, said $ 2,000 has been collected for unauthorized calls. <PERSON> Mayronne </PERSON> said officers or civilians assigned to phones from which calls were placed will have to pay for the bills. A complete breakdown of the number of calls and where they were placed was not available. About 4,300 police phones are electronically blocked from making such calls; the calls were made on 2,700 that are unrestricted. A three-month telephone company strike that ended last week has hampered efforts to trace the calls. It was reported last month that two city school districts have amassed more than $ 90,000 in calls to pay-per-call exchanges.

<TEXT>
 A flamboyant Saudi prince has rolled out the red carpet at his luxurious bayfront mansion and put aside $ 2.5 million to help save the nation's stray cats. Prince <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Fassi </PERSON>, who travels with a entourage of more than 170 people, is providing a home for dozens of stray cats himself, putting them up in seven rooms until their own private quarters can be built on his five-acre compound. `` We are going to send Asians through the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to hunt the cats,'' said the prince's personal adviser, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Talaat </PERSON>. The cats at <PERSON> al-Fassi </PERSON>'s $ 3.2 million bayfront mansion have more than royal accommodations to purr about. They have a private veterinarian and a staff to keep them well-fed and groomed. The prince said he decided to help the forgotten felines when he learned that humane groups kill the animals if owners are not found. <PERSON> Talaat </PERSON> picked up 25 cats from the <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday and said the prince expects to take up to 60 cats from the agencies. <PERSON> Al-Fassi </PERSON> made headlines in the early 1980s for a spate of controversies linked to his enormous wealth and jet-set lifestyle. In 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected <PERSON> al-Fassi </PERSON>'s appeal of a more than $ 77 million divorce settlement. <PERSON> Al-Fassi </PERSON> is negotiating to buy Indian <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, which includes 28 mansions and a country club he hopes to convert into a mosque. `` We do n't want trouble with neighbors, you know,'' said <PERSON> Talaat </PERSON>. `` We want the whole island. We'll make them an offer they ca n't refuse.

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> school district program that gave preference to minority contractors has been struck down by a federal judge who said it failed to meet a new, more rigid test established by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> on Wednesday said that `` generalized assertions'' of discrimination were not enough to justify the program, which mandates that a minimum percentage of each contract be given to firms controlled by minorities and women. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in January struck down a similar set-aside program in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. Since then, lower courts around the country have overturned other such programs. <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> ruled in a case brought by a white-owned construction firm, <ORGANIZATION> Main </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Devon </LOCATION>, after it lost out on a contract for demolition and asbestos removal at an elementary school. School officials Wednesday had no comment. The set-aside program was established in 1984. The district based its plan, which requires that each contract include at least 15 percent minority and 10 percent female participation, on a general finding of discrimination in awarding of contracts. A <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> investigation showed that only 0.5 percent of district contracts went to minority firms in 1982 and 1983. But <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> wrote that such evidence was not sufficient. `` It is clear that a majority of the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> -RRB- </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> believes that state and local laws and policies employing racial and ethnic classifications must be supported by specific evidence of discrimination against those aided by the law or policy,'' he said.

<HEAD>Study Suggests Possible Link Between Cancer and Power Lines</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A leading <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> scientist says there is statistical evidence of a possible link between cancer and exposure to electromagnetic fields that radiate from the cables and wires that electrify the nation. The unpublished findings by Dr. <PERSON> Genevieve </PERSON> <PERSON> Matanoski </PERSON>, an epidemiology professor at <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, run against the grain of traditional scientific theory about the possibility of health dangers from power distribution lines. Her conclusions fit an emerging pattern of evidence, however, that the possibility of health risks can no longer be ruled out and should be studied more closely. `` This is consistent with my judgment ... that we'll end up seeing electric and magnetic fields are cancer promoters of some kind,'' said <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Nair </PERSON>, a physicist at <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and co-author of a recent comprehensive background paper on the issue for the federal Office of Technology Assessment. Ms. <PERSON> Matanoski </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Wednesday that her findings were preliminary and required further testing, but that the results changed her view of the still unproven theory about a cancer link to power lines. `` I thought before that the theory was wrong,'' she said. `` I'm not so sure any more I'm swayed to think it's more likely than before.'' A major conclusion from her study of 50,000 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state telephone workers is that there may be an increased risk of leukemia among active workers. Incidence rates for almost all types of cancer are highest among linemen, whose exposure to electromagnetic fields is the highest in the telephone worker group, the study found. Ms. <PERSON> Matanoski </PERSON> also found exceptionally high rates of breast cancer among male technicians who work on central office telephone switching equipment. Her study found two cases of breast cancer among 9,500 central office technicians; ordinarily the incidence rate for males would be about one in 1 million, she said. Ms. <PERSON> Matanoski </PERSON> said she expected to publish her findings early next year. Any electrically charged conductor generates two kinds of invisible fields, electric and magnetic. Taken together, they are called electromagnetic fields. Some scientific findings have suggested these fields can interfere with the functioning of DNA and RNA, the controllers of cell reproduction, and that they may stimulate activity in biochemicals linked to the growth of cancer. In the century since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> began using electric power, scientists generally have dismissed suggestions of any danger to human health. Ms. <PERSON> Matanoski </PERSON> stressed in the interview that she was not yet convinced of any health danger, but said she no longer was willing to rule it out. She said further research with a larger number of workers was needed before she could be sure. `` I have too few cases -LRB- of cancer -RRB- to feel strongly about'' a possible link, she said. Her study found three cases of leukemia among 4,500 linemen, an incidence rate seven times higher than among other telephone workers. The overall rate of cancers of all types among linemen was nearly twice as high as among other telephone workers. Ms. <PERSON> Nair </PERSON> said the Matanoski results were particularly important because of her high standing in the epidemiology community and because she had earlier declared herself a skeptic. Ms. <PERSON> Nair </PERSON> said she had not yet seen the results of the study. The electric power industry already has shown signs of concern about the Matanoski findings. Earlier this month, officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, an industry group, sent letters and briefing papers to utility executives noting that Ms. <PERSON> Matanoski </PERSON>'s results `` may attract national attention because they suggest an increased risk of cancer.'' The briefing paper called the findings `` unexpected,'' noting that an earlier <PERSON> Matanoski </PERSON> study sponsored by the electric industry found no statistically significant link between cancer and electromagnetic field exposure in retired telephone workers. Ms. <PERSON> Matanoski </PERSON> said she had been suspicious of her findings in the study of older workers because of the possibility that her sample may have excluded younger telephone workers who contracted cancer but died before reaching retirement age.

 The reported crash of a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> plane carrying supplies to anti-communist rebels in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> is underscoring U.S.-Soviet differences on the eve of this weekend's superpower summit in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. Government officials said Wednesday the L-100 plane went down Monday night in southeastern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> after a flight from a military base in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. The crash occurred just two days after the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration lodged a protest with the Soviet Embassy over an abortive attempt to deliver Soviet weapons to leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. That shipment was foiled when the <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> aircraft carrying the weaponry from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> crashed in eastern <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The administration reacted indignantly to the perceived Soviet involvement in support of the Salvadoran insurgency, but there was little <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> comment Wednesday night after the disclosure of the crash in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged that there was a crash in a remote area of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and that among the passengers on board there were four Americans. Other government officials, insisting on anonymity, said all the Americans on board were killed and that some of the accompanying Angolan rebels survived. The sources were unable to identify the dead Americans but a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official on Tuesday reportedly notified the family of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Spessard </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> Hagerstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, that he had died in a plane crash `` near <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>.'' A family member told the <ORGANIZATION> Hagerstown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official had offered very little information about the crash. <PERSON> Spessard </PERSON> is survived by his wife, <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON>, and two small boys. The resupply mission from <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> can not be discussed publicly by the administration because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> provides assistance on a confidential basis. One source said the leak of the information originated with members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> opposed to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military involvement in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The disclosure highlighted the continuing differences between <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on some Third World conflicts as President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> prepare for their summit meeting in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, the French newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has told <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to stop supplying arms to the Salvadoran rebels. The Soviet ambassador to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> gave the instructions at a secret meeting Tuesday in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. The newspaper said the Soviets hoped to gain points with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in the summit by ordering the halt in support to the leftist rebels. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, whose government is run by Marxists, is one of several regional conflicts in which the superpowers have been arming opposite sides. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been providing covert aid to the <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebels in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> since 1986 while the Angolan government has been backed by Soviet weaponry and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> troops since the country gained independence in 1975. Hope for a settlement in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> rose last December when <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> agreed to withdraw its 50,000 troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> over a 27-month period as part of a broader agreement. The Angolan government and the rebel movement agreed to a cease-fire this past June but it broke down in August. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has been attempting to promote national reconciliation in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> through free elections, but thus far there has been little basis for serious negotiations. The country has been ravaged by long years of warfare. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, a critic of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military involvement, said Wednesday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has turned <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> into a `` graveyard.'' It is not known exactly how much money the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> provides the Angolan rebels because the figures are secret, but congressional sources estimate the amount at about $ 40 million annually. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials have said the Angolan government has shown little interest in engaging in serious peace negotiations. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been using <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> as a staging area for resupplying the Angolan rebels but Zairean President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sese </PERSON> <PERSON> Seko </PERSON> suspended his government's cooperation with that effort in June when he became a peace mediator. <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>, during a visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in early October, agreed to the resumption of the resupply flights under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure. The Monday flight is said to have been the first since June.

 A bomb today killed the powerful chairman of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s largest bank as he drove to work, and officials said the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> terrorist group claimed responsibility. <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON>, 59, died in the explosion at about 8:30 a.m. in the affluent <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Bad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Homburg </LOCATION>, where he lived. Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, his eyes filled with tears and his voice breaking, condemned the slaying as `` a cowardly and brutal murder'' and described the influential European financier as a friend and a patriot. <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON>, probably the best-known figure in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s business world, often advised <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and frequently accompanied the chancellor on his foreign trips The chief federal prosecutor's office said the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION>, which has carried out numerous terrorist attacks in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, claimed responsibility in a letter found at the scene of the attack. It was the first known <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> attack in more than three years. Police officials said the blast lifted <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON>'s armored BMW into the air, consuming it in a ball of fire. The <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the chief federal prosecutor's office said <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON>'s driver was alive but suffered serious injuries. Prosecutor's spokesman <PERSON> Hans-Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Foerster </PERSON> said authorities erroneously reported earlier that the driver, <PERSON> Jakob </PERSON> <PERSON> Nix </PERSON>, had died, blaming the error on an incorrect report from police on the scene. The blast was heard as far away as three miles and shattered windows in the vicinity. <PERSON> Foerster </PERSON> said it appeared a remote-controlled detonating device set off explosives placed in the car's path. Other officials speculated that a man on a bicycle may have carried out the attack. Police also said they were searching for a man in a blue jogging suit and cap who fled on foot after the attack. Helicopters were being used in the search. Witnesses told police a <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> with <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> license plates was apparently used in the escape. Later reports said police also were looking for an <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION>. An <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Siegbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON> was considered a top target of leftist terrorists because of the investment policies of his bank. <PERSON> Herrausen </PERSON> led the <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> on an aggressive expansion course aimed at making the institution one of the top 10 or 15 banks in the world. He urged greater investment in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other parts of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Most recently, he had been speaking out in favor of more West German investment in neighboring <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Police sealed off the wooded, rural road where the car was destroyed. More than three hours after the blast, the banker's body remained in the back seat of the shattered and burned car. <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON> was the second chairman of a major West German bank to be slain in the last 12 years by the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Dresdner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s Chairman <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponto </PERSON> was killed by the group in 1977. <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON> joined <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in 1969, became a board member two years later. He was named bank chairman in 1988. The <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> chief was probably <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s most influential business figure, sitting on numerous boards of directors, including for the giant <ORGANIZATION> Daimler-Benz </ORGANIZATION> conglomerate. The killing stunned business and government leaders throughout <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, Free Democratic member of Parliament <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Weng </PERSON> interrupted a budget debate to denounce `` the horrible news'' of <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON>'s death. Interior Minister <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON> broke into tears as he told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> about <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON>'s death. In <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, the frantic-paced stock exchange came to a minute-long halt. <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON> is survived by a wife and two daughters. The last known <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> attack occurred in October 1986, when diplomat <PERSON> Gerold </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Braunmuehl </PERSON> was shot and killed on a street in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> said today he was determined to gain control of the presidential palace from rebellious Christian Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> but that he would spare no effort to avoid bloodshed. `` I do n't want bloodshed, either in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> or in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> told reporters at a Lebanese army barracks in Syrian-policed eastern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. But, he added: `` I'll use all possible means to reunite the country.'' <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> has fired <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> as army commander and ordered him to relinquish the presidential palace. The general refused, and he accused <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> of being a lackey of the Syrians, whom he has been trying to force out of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said hundreds of Syrian army trucks hauled ammunition to forward positions facing <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s troops in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the eastern and northeastern mountains. `` The Syrian troops are in combat formations. Their command is supplying them with enough ammunition for quite a long time,'' one military source said. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> sent an amphibious troop ship, the <PERSON> Orage </PERSON>, to Lebanese waters in preparation for a possible evacuation if French nationals were endangered. It sailed from the southern port of <LOCATION> Toulon </LOCATION> early today. Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> said Lebanese army units serving under the new commander, Adm. <PERSON> Emile </PERSON> <PERSON> Lahoud </PERSON>, would take part in any effort to dislodge <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> from his headquarters at the shell-shattered presidential palace in <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> will not quit easily. The nationalist army would take part in the battle to evict him,'' said <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>, who is minister of public works in <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>'s unified government. About 22,000 mainly Moslem troops serve under <PERSON> Lahoud </PERSON>, while <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has a predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> force of 20,000 soldiers. <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>, a Maronite Catholic like <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, accused the rebellious general of `` partitioning <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' A Moslem government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday: `` The next 48 hours will be decisive to determine whether <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s problem will be dealt with politically or militarily.'' Parliamentary deputy <PERSON> Butros </PERSON> <PERSON> Harb </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, was dispatched by <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> early in the week `` to discuss ways of solving <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s problem,'' the official said. Thirty-three right-wing French parliamentarians were on their way back to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> today, a day after they flew into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Christian enclave to declare support for <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> In heavy rain Wednesday, protesters carried umbrellas and took cover under pine trees to maintain a human shield around the presidential palace. A large crowd was still there today. `` The army usually defends the people. Now the people are defending the army and its general,'' the <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> spokesman said. But the Moslem Voice of the Nation radio, in a commentary, said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> was using the Christian youths as `` human sandbags to hide behind.'' Shiite Moslem militia chieftain <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, in a statement, called on `` our brethren in the Christian enclave to support the survival of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, not the survival of a person -LRB- <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, who doubles as minister of electrical and hydraulic resources, said <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>'s government was one of `` national unity. A government of peace. We prefer to solve this problem peacefully, but we can not wait for ever.'' Parliament elected <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> president on Saturday to replace his assassinated predecessor, <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>. Both pledged to implement the provisions of a <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> peace agreement hammered out by <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s parliament in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who fought the Syrians for six months earlier this year, rejected the accord because it did not include a fixed timetable for a Syrian troop withdrawal. The Syrians have 40,000 troops controlling 70 percent of Lebanese territory under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate.

 Authorities have cleared the way for criminal charges to be filed against ousted leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> and other disgraced officials of the past <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership, East German officials announced today. A security cordon also was erected around the lavish compound where <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> and other party figures suspected of wrongdoing live to prevent them from taking state property, the official <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. <PERSON> Hartmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Boecker </PERSON>, head of the local governing council for the <LOCATION> Neubrandenburg </LOCATION> area where the party officials live, said he ordered the area sealed off and stripped the former leaders of their immunity from criminal charges. <PERSON> Boecker </PERSON> said the declaration clears the way for criminal proceedings against <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, former Premier <PERSON> Willi </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoph </PERSON> and others. There was no immediate indication of what charges might be filed or when. The actions coincide with other efforts by party chief <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> to distance his new, reform-minded leadership from the reported abuses of power committed by <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> and his colleagues. On Wednesday, East German newspapers disclosed that <PERSON> Stoph </PERSON> had taken valuables from his opulent estate after <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials began investigating allegations of wrongdoing by former party figures. The reports said <PERSON> Stoph </PERSON> had turned a park into a private estate that included several homes and an indoor swimming pool. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> and Communist Premier <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> signed a petition circulated by activists who are calling for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to remain socialist. Keeping a socialist framework could help the Communists maintain the power they have wielded without contest for 40 years. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, 52, who has been in office only six weeks, faces a strong challenge from reform activists he will meet with Wednesday, as well as from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> hierarchy that will attend a special congress on Dec. 15-17. His ability to remain party leader will depend largely on his success in appeasing the opposition forces at Wednesday's talks. The talks are the latest political development in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where the exodus of thousands of people and massive anti-government demonstrations led to the ouster of <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> on Oct. 18 and the opening of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall on Nov. 9. The party has agreed that <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> will debate the course of reform with delegates from allied political parties and from opposition groups. Both sides agreed to let church officials moderate the discussions at a Lutheran Church facility in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported Wednesday. A main issue will be a proposal to strike the Communists' guaranteed monopoly on power from the state constitution, church sources said Spokeswoman <PERSON> Angelika </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbe </PERSON> of the East German Social Democrats said her recently formed party planned to call for measures to free political prisoners and remove barriers remaining for the return of those who fled the past regime. Nearly 300,000 East Germans have moved to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> this year, discouraged about prospects for speedy or thorough reform at home. Opposition groups have pushed for the reform talks to cover economic issues. A main concern is stopping further damage to the weak East German mark caused by black-market sales spurred by travel to the West. The petition signed by <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> was initiated by writer <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heym </PERSON> and other East German intellectuals concerned about the country's future. They want a national referendum on whether the country should remain socialist. The Communist leadership, as well as many members of the pro-reform groups, oppose West German efforts to work toward reunification of the two Germanys. West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> on Tuesday laid out a 10-point plan for building a confederation between the two states, aiming at reunification. The <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> government launched a diplomatic offensive to promote the idea. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> telephoned President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to inform the allies of the plan. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> has sought to use East German public sentiment against reunification as a rallying call to win popular support for his beleaguered <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have the historic duty to preserve this country with its anti-fascist ideals and traditions as a socialist alternative within German development,'' he told backers of the appeal, who want a nationwide `` vote of confidence'' in socialism. Echoing the words of the petition, <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> promised that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will preserve `` peace and social justice, individual freedom, freedom of travel for all and the preservation of the environment.'' The Communists, bowing to pressure from growing opposition forces, have promised free elections. No date has been set.

<TEXT>
 Many residents of the affluent <LOCATION> Escalon </LOCATION> neighborhood, including about 20 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens, took advantage of a brief guerrilla truce and fled the battle zone today. The leftist rebels launched a second assault on the capital Wednesday and turned their weapons on wealthy districts, where they seized homes, forcing scores of Americans to take refuge in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. Rebels were dug into the neighborhoods late Wednesday, vowing to paralyze the heart of the country's wealth and power. But the rebels had declared a six-hour truce beginning at 6 a.m. -LRB- 7 a.m. EST -RRB- for evacuation of those who wished to leave, and <PERSON> Escalon </PERSON> was mostly quiet this morning, with only scattered gunfire. It appeared most of the rebels retreated shortly before dawn up the lower slopes of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Volcano </LOCATION>, which looms over the district. However, some evacuating residents said rebel snipers remained in the their homes. The bodies of at least nine soldiers lay on the streets. Reporters saw only one dead guerrilla, a woman still clutching her U.S.-made M-16. The total number of casualties was not known. Several Americans said they planned to leave the country this evening on the first of several charter flights arranged by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. Diplomatic sources said about 250 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens would fly out this evening. `` I'm not coming back,'' said <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, who carried her 8-month-old baby <PERSON> Cassandra </PERSON> from their home down <LOCATION> Mirador </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> to where an embassy official was waiting for them. Her husband, <PERSON> William </PERSON>, was barefoot. Both are teachers at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. About 30 guerrillas took over their home before dawn Wednesday. They were accompanied by two other teachers, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sheri </PERSON> <PERSON> McKibben </PERSON>. Small groups of residents carrying belongings gathered on almost every street corner in the 20-square-block area. The embassy official awaiting the <ORGANIZATION> Lewises </ORGANIZATION>, said 12 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> households had family members who spent Wednesday night in <LOCATION> Escalon </LOCATION> in rebel-controlled areas. The official, who declined to give his name, said all the Americans left the neighborhood this morning. Other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens managed to leave Wednesday. Some Salvadoran residents said they were staying to protect their homes. The winding, hilly streets were blocked at intervals by barricades of cars, most of them with their tires shot out. A burned-out light tank destroyed by a rebel rocket sat on the street up from the <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' house. Many Americans had earlier taken refuge in the embassy or the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in areas well away from the fighting. About 100 Americans, almost all women and children, spent the night at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and were to leave today in a chartered jet, embassy spokesman <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said the Salvadoran national airline <ORGANIZATION> TACA </ORGANIZATION> planned extra flights for the next few days to carry others. He refused to call it an evacuation, saying that embassy dependents were given extra leave for Christmas vacation. `` No one is being made to go,'' he added. There are between 8,000 and 10,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> at any one time about 400 to 500 of them are employees of the embassy and the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> and their dependents, <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said. Guerrillas seized a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> employee's home Wednesday, but the family was allowed to leave the area unhurt, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The home of an embassy employee also was reported burned during the fighting, but it was not clear if it was the same house or if the fire was set deliberately. Embassy officials refused to give any other details. The embassy, miles away near downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, told its employees not to try to get to work. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s diplomatic liaison office, about four blocks from <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s residence, was taken by the rebels, but the few people inside were allowed to leave escorted by rescue workers, a <ORGANIZATION> Salvadoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> source said. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official denied the office had been taken but said staffers reported fighting in the neighborhood. A Western diplomat said the guerrillas had also seized the residence of a mid-level <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> diplomat, allowing those inside to be evacuated. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said perhaps 100 to 200 rebels had taken positions Wednesday in <LOCATION> Escalon </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Benito </PERSON>, heavily armed and moving in small groups. The rebels issued a statement in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Wednesday saying their fighters were under orders not to attack <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens. Guerrillas seized the homes of three wealthy Salvadorans, but freed the people inside `` to demonstrate'' they were a `` responsible force'' fighting for `` democracy,'' the rebel broadcast said. The broadcast by the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> rebels called Wednesday's attack part of a `` constant strategic siege on the capital city, the nerve center of the nation.'' <PERSON> Dagoberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON>, a rebel commander, said Wednesday's attack was the second wave of an offensive first launched on the capital Nov. 11, during which an estimated 1,000 people were killed. The first phase turned slums and poor neighborhoods into battlefields for 12 days, sending tens of thousands fleeing.

<HEAD>Attorney General Did Not Want Exxon Third Mate Indicted, D.A. Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The district attorney's office considered bringing charges against the third mate of the Exxon Valdez in addition to the captain, but <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s attorney general vetoed the idea, a prosecutor says. Anchorage Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said he favored indicting <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Cousins </PERSON>, who was in control of the tanker when it struck a reef March 24 and began spilling nearly 11 million gallons of oil into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. Cole testified Wednesday at a pretrial hearing for fired skipper <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> that he was told `` the attorney general said no'' to a Cousins indictment. `` The reasons we were told were that they felt Mr. <PERSON> Cousins </PERSON> could help them out in their civil case, and they did n't want to make Mr. Cousins an enemy in their civil case,'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. His testimony came on the third day of the hearing for <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, who has been charged in the spill. Cole, who will be the prosecutor at <LOCATION> Hazelwood </LOCATION>'s trial Jan. 22, was among a string of witnesses the state has presented to show why the captain should be tried. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, 43, a veteran mariner from <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, was not on the bridge at the time of the grounding. He left the tanker under the supervision of Cousins. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> faces felony charges of criminal mischief plus misdemeanor charges of reckless endangerment, operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>'s lawyers say charges should be dismissed because he reported the tanker accident and thereby qualified for immunity under state law. Virtually every piece of evidence against <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> can be traced to his prompt report and may not be used against him, the defense argued. The state contends that discovery of the spill was inevitable and that independent sources provided information for <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>'s prosecution

 Eight people aboard a twin-engine commuter plane that vanished off <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> have been given up for dead. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> called off the search by air and sea Wednesday night for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> plane that disappeared Tuesday during a 17-mile flight from <LOCATION> Block </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> to the mainland. Searchers had found the bodies of a passenger's two dogs that had been on board, as well as a cabin panel, life jackets, seat cushions, a headset and other debris believed to be from the plane, but saw no other sign of the aircraft itself or those aboard. `` The results of the search indicated there were probably no survivors from the crash,'' Petty Officer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jersey </PERSON> said. In Westerly, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON> said today that without wreckage the cause of the crash is unlikely to be determined. `` I think all we're going to be able to do today is go through the aircraft records and the pilot records, and unless something comes up out of the ordinary, there wo n't be much,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> had no authority to order a search for the wreckage, and any attempts to find it would be up to the airline's insurance company, <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> began its search shortly after the British <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Islander </PERSON> plane, built in 1969, was reported missing. Coast Guard officials had expressed hope early Wednesday of finding survivors, but veteran islanders said the seas of 5 to 6 feet and water temperature of about 45 degrees made survival unlikely. The debris was found mainly in an area where the water averages 100 feet deep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Grady </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' attorney, said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> would also investigate. The plane `` had the most thorough inspection it gets in the preceding 30 days,'' he said.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government said today it will begin dismantling its fortifications along the border with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, and lawmakers recommended abolishing some of the toughest laws used to crack down on dissent. Government spokesman <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jansen </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> was asked today to start immediate removal of `` technical equipment'' along parts of the Czechoslovak-Austrian border. Such equipment includes concrete pylons linked with barbed wire and some electronic wire to detect trespassers. The moves came one day after <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> took the historic step of removing the guaranteed leading role of the Communist Party from the constitution. <PERSON> Jansen </PERSON> refused to specify when and exactly where work on the border would start, saying it was likely to begin near the Slovak capital of <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>, a one-hour drive east of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. In May, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> started dismantling fortifications along its border with neutral <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, its only point of contact with a Western country. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> also has a long border with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Jansen </PERSON> made no mention of action along that border. The order to dismantle part of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s portion of the Iron Curtain reflected the new foreign policy that Communist Premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> has promised to follow. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> is due to name a new coalition government by Sunday that would include non-Communists and possibly members of the Civic Forum opposition group, which headed up 11 days of anti-government protests and a hugely successful general strike Monday. He continued consultations today after announcing that he could accept opposition suggestions on whom to include. Civic Forum spokesman <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dienstbier </PERSON> said Wednesday night that the opposition wanted a civilian Communist in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and a non-Communist overseeing police forces at the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dienstbier </PERSON> reiterated past statements that Civic Forum has no Cabinet aspirations, but he did not specifically exclude participation in the government by some of the experts who have worked with the opposition. Seeking to paint himself as a figure of national consensus in the current crisis, <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> in a television speech Wednesday made a number of points aimed at winning him the sympathy of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s 15.5 million citizens. His call for a reassessment of the 1968 <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> invasion that crushed the 1968 `` Prague Spring'' reforms was accompanied by a pledge to negotiate the withdrawal of the 80,000 Soviet troops stationed in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Those troops were seen as the legitimizing force of the Czechoslovak leaders installed by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> after the invasion. Those leaders _ ousted party chief <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> and other top Communists _ now have lost power. The state news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> today said unidentified parliamentary deputies suggested abolition of toughened laws on public order, which were passed in March and used to impose stiff fines or jail terms on hundreds of people arrested during a series of anti-government demonstrations in January. The deputies said this amendment, and a series of other new legal measures, should be submitted for consideration in Parliament Dec. 12-13. The deputies also proposed shortening the period of pre-trial custody to a two-month maximum. Political prisoners have sometimes waited more than a year to go to court. The deputies also proposed removing the criminal offense of `` abusing a religious function'' from the statute books. This law, which imposed maximum imprisonment of three years, was frequently used against priests deemed to have overstepped the strict state controls on churches in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Priests must have a state licence to practice in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, and many have had to go underground after being barred from office by the authorities. The deputies also want an unspecified change in the criminal code article on emigration, <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> said. It seemed likely they would seek to drop criminal charges against those who left the country illegally. The deputies also recommended that the independence of courts be anchored in a new draft constitution to be published and passed soon. They also seek a new law meting out punishment to those who damage the environment. Thirty percent of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s forests have been destroyed by acid rain and other pollution, and both air and water are heavily polluted in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and several other cities. Tighter control of pollution by large state enterprises has been a key demand of opposition groups for several years. Also today, six political prisoners were reported released, and former Charter 77 spokesman <PERSON> Stanislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Devaty </PERSON>, who went underground several weeks ago, and another rights activist were amnestied by President <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>. There were no other details immediately available.

 The 1989 hurricane season, marked by the costliest storm in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history, officially ended today with yet another tropical storm forming in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. At 8 a.m. EST, Tropical Storm <PERSON> Karen </PERSON>, with 50 mph winds, was about 125 miles south-southwest of <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> and was not expected to strengthen, said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>. It was drifttng toward <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> at about 5 mph. Depressions become named storms when their sustained winds reach 39 mph; hurricanes have winds of at least 74 mph. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> is the 11th named storm of the season, which began June 1. The six-month season was far less deadly than 1988's, in which 550 people died in storms. This year's storms killed 84 people, including 56 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said meteorologist <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>. Hurricane Hugo was blamed for 49 deaths, including 21 in this country. It slammed into <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> on Sept. 21. `` I've seen greater damage in smaller areas,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheets </PERSON>, director of the hurricane center. `` But I've never seen it on such a large scale where you go mile after mile with such massive damage.'' Overall damage from Hugo totaled about $ 10 billion. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, it caused a record storm damage of about $ 7 billion. Most of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> damage was around <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> are racing to recover from Hugo in time for the tourist season. `` We are still in a sense reeling from the effects of <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> but that did n't dampen our spirit,'' said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrelly </PERSON>, governor of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. He said Wednesday that St. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> and <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> are ready for winter tourists and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> would be ready by early 1990. It was the most expensive disaster for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> since the organization began 110 years ago. Latest figures show the agency has spent about $ 38 million in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caudill </PERSON>, a spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The hurricane season, which began June 1, had four tropical storms, counting <PERSON> Karen </PERSON>, and seven hurricanes. The storms also were stronger than usual, said Sheets. Last year, there were seven tropical storms and five hurricanes. The <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> season usually has 10 named storms. Normally, only five or six whip up the 74-mph sustained winds to become a hurricane. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>, the fifth major <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane in the last decade to reach <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shores, may have marked the end of a 30-year period of fewer, weaker hurricanes, Sheets said. `` There have been fewer of the stronger hurricanes making landfall since the 1960s,'' Sheets said. `` Now maybe we're starting to return to more normal activity like we had in the'50s and'60s.'' During the 1950s, eight major hurricanes hit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, while seven struck the following decade. After <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>, the most damaging tropical system this year was Tropical Storm <PERSON> Allison </PERSON>. It dumped large amounts of rain and caused 11 deaths and $ 500 million damage in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>.

Ms. <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON>'s former coach, <PERSON> Bela </PERSON> <PERSON> Karolyi </PERSON>, said today she was `` probably'' in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> obtaining travel papers, but an embassy spokesman denied it. <PERSON> Karolyi </PERSON> became a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen last spring and is currently in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> with an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women's gymnastics team. Ms. <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> told Hungarian border officials she had been banned by Romanian leader <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> from traveling abroad and was fleeing her native land `` for the sake of freedom,'' official media reported. Ms. <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> crossed into <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> by car before dawn Tuesday at the border town of <LOCATION> Kiszombor </LOCATION>, with six other Romanians who were not identified, the <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. Her defection was a surprise, particularly because the 28-year-old athlete-turned-trainer reportedly had close ties with the <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> family and at one time was said to have been romantically involved with the Romanian president's son, <PERSON> Nicu </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> dropped from sight Wednesday, when she and her companions left the hotel in the nearby town of <LOCATION> Szeged </LOCATION> where they had been lodged by police, according to Hungarian press reports. Ms. <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> had been given a three-day temporary residence permit. A spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> today the gymnast had not contacted them and they knew nothing of her whereabouts. Because of her achievements, Ms. <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> was named a `` Hero of Socialist Labor'' by <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, the hard-line leader who declared at last week's <ORGANIZATION> Romanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that he would not yield to the forces of reform sweeping the rest of the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION>. At age 14, Ms. <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> dazzled the sports world at the 1976 <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> Olympic Games with the first-ever scores of perfect 10s in Olympic gymnastics. She won three gold medals, in the uneven bars, balance beam and overall competitions. The achievements of the 4-foot-11 teen-ager brought her elite status in her homeland and tremendous popularity in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. During a competitive career that lasted until 1984, Ms. <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> won a total of 21 gold medals in Olympic and other international contests. She reportedly had been living in an eight-room villa and had a Western car, both extremely rare for private citizens in a country that has endured chronic shortages of consumer goods for most of this decade. In the past two years, tens of thousands of Romanians have sought refuge in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> because of worsening economic conditions and political intransigence at home. `` Just like me, she was chased out of the country by the Romanian authorities,'' said <PERSON> Karolyi </PERSON>, who defected to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1981.

 A police officer whose slaying of a black suspect set off three days of rioting took the stand at his manslaughter trial today and said he fired because the man was bearing down on him with his motorcycle. `` I turned my body to face the motorcycle. He just came straight at me with a tremendous noise,'' said Officer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>. `` He was just aiming at me. I was just able to turn my body, draw my gun and shoot.'' The five-year veteran of the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said he thought he was going to die and was briefly in shock. After recovering, he said, he found no vital signs when he checked on the motorcyclist. He saw that the cyclist's passenger was injured and radioed a dispatcher to say he had fired his weapon and a fatality was involved. The prosecution charges <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> acted with gross negligence when he shot and killed the motorcyclist, <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, 23, on Jan. 16, sparking three days of rioting in the community's black neighborhoods. The passenger, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, died the next day. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> is charged with manslaughter in their deaths. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, 31, testified that he was `` hyper'' and that the dispatcher did not understand his first transmission. He said he took a deep breath and repeated it. Within moments, an angry crowd gathered and <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> said he and others `` were getting hit right and left'' with rocks and bottles. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>'s account came after a half-hour of questioning about his personal history and his police service, giving the jury an impression of a well-trained officer with a list of commendations. Under cross examination, Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> to read aloud from a police review document that listed <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> as average in most categories, including decision-making and reliability. <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> also had <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> recount an incident in which a jai-alai player accused <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> of physical abuse during a strike. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> was just beginning to review the events leading up to the shooting when the trial was recessed for 45 minutes after an alternate juror complained of abdominal pain and nausea. Addressing his answers with a slight Spanish accent directly to the jury, the Colombian-born <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> wore a dark blue suit, dress shirt and red tie for his appearance. The testimony was broadcast live on <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> television and radio. Prosecution witnesses contended that the motorcyclist was in the opposite lane from <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> when the officer coolly took aim at the driver, tracked him with his gun and fired the fatal shot as the bike was about to pass him. The defense, however, insists that the motorcyclist, attempting to outrun a pursuing squad car, had crossed into the traffic lane where <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> was standing and the officer shot in self-defense to avoid being run over. One defense witness, 18-year-old <PERSON> Dedrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Belle </PERSON>, balked at giving depositions and had fled investigators attempting to talk to him, according to court testimony. <PERSON> Belle </PERSON>, who lives in the <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> neighborhood where the shooting and subsequent rioting occurred, told the court Wednesday he feared for his life if he was made to testify for the defense. `` It will result in violence ... because I'm black and he shot a black guy,'' <PERSON> Belle </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Farina </PERSON>. Over the objections of media attorneys, the judge banned any filming of <LOCATION> Belle </LOCATION> during his brief testimony. His testimony was aimed at compromising star prosecution witness <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who was talking with <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> just before the shooting. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> wound up with the cartridge casing from the fatal bullet after the shooting, but denied on the stand that he had waved it about or shown it to neighbors before turning it over to police. <PERSON> Belle </PERSON>, however, said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> showed the shell to everyone, and even let him hold it. Other defense witnesses Wednesday included a former <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> professor, <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Alpert </PERSON>, who prepared a study of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police weapon discharges between Jan. 1, 1980, and Dec. 31, 1986. <PERSON> Alpert </PERSON>, who now teaches at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>, said 13 percent of the 150 shootings he examined were instances in which an officer was firing while being attacked by a vehicle. The prosecution has contended that <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> disregarded police policy when he failed to step out of the roadway, and then fired at a moving vehicle. When the case opened Oct. 23, the defense attempted unsuccessfully to move the trial, arguing that <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> juries would be too worried about renewed racial violence to find <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> innocent. Twice before in this decade, innocent verdicts favoring policemen accused of killing blacks have led to rioting, and the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> police forces have been on alert because of <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>'s trial.

 Motorists bombed a toll booth that is under construction and claim that other parts of an unpopular turnpike system that opens next year also are boobytrapped, newspapers reported Thursday. No one was injured in the Wednesday night blast, which damaged the foundation of an unfinished toll booth, newspapers said. Many commuters oppose having to pay a toll to drive into <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>. Many bomb threats have been made against toll booths, which have yet to open, but police have no suspects, according to the reports. An anonymous caller told the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Dagbladet </ORGANIZATION> that a group of 18 motorists was responsible for the bomb. `` We will stop the toll system. We will continue attacks, but do not wish to hurt anyone. Explosives were buried before concrete was poured, so it is too late for police to search,'' he said.

<HEAD>Don't Close Leaning Tower, Pisa Officials Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PISA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Local officials Thursday disputed the government's plan to close <LOCATION> Pisa </LOCATION>'s famed leaning tower for restoration work, saying it is in no immediate danger. `` The closure is unjustified because the situation of the tower has not worsened recently and because conservation work can be initiated without banning tourists,'' said <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Toniolo </PERSON>, who heads Opera Primaziale, the private institution managing and restoring the tower. An estimated 800,000 visitors a year climb the 294 marble steps of the 162-foot monument, bringing in revenue of about $ 71.4 million. The government commission for public works suggested Tuesday the leaning tower be closed immediately. A final decision by the government is expected soon, although the city can appeal it to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Government experts are worried because its tilt has been increasing by an average 0.047 inches a year since measurements began in 1918. The tower was completed in 1360, and experts believe it began leaning immediately because it was built on sinking soil. The government has allotted $ 7.1 million for the conservation of the tower, but experts have been stumped on how to save it. <PERSON> Gero </PERSON> <PERSON> Geri </PERSON>, a professor of topography in <LOCATION> Pisa </LOCATION>, has said it will take at least 100 years before the tower reached the point of toppling.

 The federal government will give <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> $ 8.4 million to fight the threat of forest fires fueled by thousands of trees downed by Hurricane Hugo, state and federal officials said Thursday. The money will be used to cut 11,400 miles of firebreaks, lease fire detection and fighting equipment, fund a public awareness program and coordinate efforts to salvage downed timber worth an estimated $ 1 billion, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` We at <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> believe the Hugo forest blow-down is a serious emergency with the potential for great danger in the event of serious, uncontrolled wildfires,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. Officials say 36 percent of the 12.2 million acres of forested land in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> was damaged by the Sept. 21 storm. They say they are weighing plans to ban burning in some unincorporated areas of the state to lessen the fire danger.

<TEXT>
 Violence broke out amid a nationwide general strike, and two people were killed and 450 injured, police said Thursday. A supporter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was killed in a gun battle inside the <ORGANIZATION> Dhaka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> campus with student activists of the <ORGANIZATION> Awami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> during the general strike, a police official said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Awami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> both oppose President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> and his government, but like most opposition groups, they periodically fight each other. Both groups supported the strike, which was called for Wednesday and Thursday. One person was killed and at least nine others injured when two bombs exploded at an opposition rally in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> on Thursday, the officer said. The strike was called by the <ORGANIZATION> Awami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bangladesh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, another major opposition group, to dramatize their demands for <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>'s resignation. In <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, shops, banks and schools remained closed and traffic was sparse Thursday. News reports said the strike was successful in at least 20 other major towns. Police and news reports said at least 450 people were injured and 300 anti-government demonstrators arrested nationwide in clashes with police. It was the latest in a series of strikes called by opposition parties to try to force free elections under a caretaker government. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> says he is willing to hold new elections without relinquishing power, a proposal the opposition has rejected. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>'s two main political opponents _ <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Awami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Khaleda </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Bangladesh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ said the success of the strike was a verdict against the government. Mrs. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> told <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> to resign by Dec. 31 or face more street protests. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>, 59, a former army general, seized power in a bloodless coup in 1982. He resigned from the army in 1985 and a year later was elected to a five -- year presidential term in elections that many believed to be rigged.

 Grand Forks officials were `` pleased as the dickens'' about winning a bid for rail-based MX nuclear missiles that would bring jobs and prestige. `` That's a lot of insurance policies, cars and turtlenecks,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, after learning Wednesday that the <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> was among six new sites chosen to get the missiles, all of which are currently kept at a base in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. But in <LOCATION> Minot </LOCATION>, 200 miles to the west, there was disappointment. Both cities lobbied hard for the missiles, through letter-writing campaigns and visits to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The 50 MX missiles are to be removed from underground silos in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and placed on 25 trains, each with two MX missiles aboard. The trains will be in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and on bases in Grand Forks and five other areas around the country. The missiles will be moved onto civilian railroad tracks in time of crisis. The loss of the rail-based system was hard on <LOCATION> Minot </LOCATION> because it came just about a year after the transfer of 18 fighter jets to a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> base in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. `` You win some and you lose some,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Christianson </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Minot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>'s military affairs committee. The Grand Forks base and the <ORGANIZATION> Minot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Base maintain nuclear missiles and strategic bombers. The <LOCATION> Minot </LOCATION> base opened in 1959, and the Grand Forks base in 1960. The <LOCATION> Minot </LOCATION> base has about 14,000 military personnel and their families, the Grand Forks base 13,000. Both bases contribute more than $ 200 million to the economies of their communities. `` We're disappointed, of course,'' said <LOCATION> Minot </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON>. `` We do n't know what they have down the line, but we'd accept anything else. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Caruana </PERSON>, commander of the Grand Forks base, said construction of the MX system could begin in 1992 and the system could become operational two years later. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> houses about 300 Minuteman missiles _ each capable of carrying three warheads _ in underground silos near <LOCATION> Minot </LOCATION> and Grand Forks. The MX missiles can carry up to 10 warheads. <PERSON> Caruana </PERSON> said the Grand Forks garrison will cost $ 80 million to $ 100 million, and employ as many as 450 people. But Grand Forks Mayor <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Polovitz </PERSON>, along with the state's congressional delegation, cautioned that the project might not be built at all because of changes taking place in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its Eastern European allies `` I still have some questions whether it will be funded because of what is happening in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> now,'' <PERSON> Polovitz </PERSON> said. `` I'm pleased that we as acommunity got together and worked for this. I'm also pleased with what's happening in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, so we're kind of caught in between. `` If they go ahead with the rail garrison and fund it, I'm pleased as the dickens to have it here in Grand Forks. Peace activists, meanwhile, were unhappy with the entire idea of the MX missiles. `` An MX missile by its very nature is a first-strike weapon,'' said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Hermodson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Crookston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Crookston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, near Grand Forks. `` I see this either as a continuation of first-strike capability or as a welfare program for weapons manufacturers.

 The man struggling to renew <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s revolution more than 70 years after it declared religion the `` opiate of the people'' was himself baptized in his peasant village into the ancient rites of Russian Orthodoxy. And if 58 years later <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> does not believe in God, his early years apparently engendered a healthy respect for those who do, including his mother. The <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> years have seen a dramatic shift in official tolerance of religion in a country whose people ostensibly have been turned into spiritual materialists by decades of Communist dogma. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has told religious leaders that they, too, have a place in the Communist-led healing of the nation's psyche. But as government pressure eases, the future of a nascent religious revival is beginning to depend more on the willingness of church leaders to throw off their own strictures and traditional subservience. Since <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> became Soviet leader in March 1985: _ The number of baptisms and reopenings of churches in the Christian heartland have increased dramatically. Important religious centers like the Pechorsky Monastery of <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> have been given back. Jews also enjoy greater religious freedom and a revival of Islam in Central <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> is increasing the number of seminary students and mosques. _ Scores of religious dissidents of all faiths have been freed from jails and prison camp. _ The patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church has met with the Soviet leader for the first time in more than 40 years. Clergy celebrated the 400th anniversary of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Patriarchate on Oct. 13 with the first service in more than 70 years in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Uspensky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cathedral </LOCATION>, where Russian czars once were crowned _ <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has met with a top representative of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, and will meet with Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> on Friday. Members of the banned Ukrainian <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in the western <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> believe the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> meeting will lead to legalization of their church after 43 years underground. Asked in July whether he had been baptized after his birth in 1931 in the southern Russian village of <LOCATION> Privolnoye </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> replied: `` Yes, I was. I think it's quite normal, is n't it?'' Reporters who have visited the area say his mother, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>, still regularly attends Russian Orthodox services. Interviewed by Finnish TV in conjunction with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> in October, Archbishop <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Stavropol </LOCATION> said the official attitude toward religion in that region, which includes <LOCATION> Privolnoye </LOCATION>, eased when <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was the local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader. `` Practically speaking, beginning in 1975 in <LOCATION> Stavropol </LOCATION> churches and groups of believers have been able to exercise all their rights,'' he said. `` We've had perestroika since 1975.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was regional party chief from 1970 to 1978. When he met with Patriarch <PERSON> Pimen </PERSON> of the Russian Orthodox Church prior to the celebration of the church's millenium in 1988, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> made clear that religious believers have both a stake and a place in his reform program. The millenium, he said, should be `` marked by the consolidation of our country's believers, all working people, for the sake of our common great cause of perestroika, of the renewal of socialism, the complete unfolding of its humanistic ethical potential.'' Soviet officials have been reporting for more than two years that a new law on religion is being prepared, and they say it is likely to be presented to the Soviet legislature soon. They promise the law will ease strict Stalin-era prohibitions on group religious instruction and charitable work by churches, and make it easier for them to receive official recognition. The law has not yet been changed, but some Russian Orthodox churches have begun to act. According to the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> parishes are contributing heavily to support children's homes in the capital <PERSON> Veniamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Yefremov </PERSON>, an inspector for the government <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> that has been charged with overseeing believers, encouraged more charitable work. `` Apparently some people are waiting for some instructions from above. There is only one instruction in such work _ the dictates of the heart,'' he said. Muscovites say baptism has become increasingly popular, even fashionable, in some circles. But it does not mean that the baptized know much about the faith they have embraced, or even want to know. Two scholars, writing in the Communist theoretical journal <PERSON> Kommunist </PERSON> in 1987, said people had begun flocking to churches to find some beauty in the religious chanting and church icons that was missing in their increasingly cheerless lives in the Soviet system. Religious critics wonder whether Russian Orthodox Church officials, used to taking what the government is willing to give, can take advantage of the freer atmosphere. During recent harsh years, the Russian Orthodox Church concentrated much activity on disarmament issues, which at the time coincided with Soviet government propaganda efforts. Ukrainian Catholics are demanding the return from the Russian Orthodox Church of buildings and property taken over when their religion was forced underground in 1946. `` If we could count on sincerity and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> love from the Russian church there would n't be a problem,'' said Father <PERSON> Yaroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Chukhny </PERSON>, who led <LOCATION> Lvov </LOCATION>'s Cathedral of the Transfiguration from the Russian Orthodox Church to the Ukrainian <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 29. `` The essence of religion is not building churches or holding beautiful services, but the morals of man,'' he said.

 Photos of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Stealth fighter, said to show the top-secret warplane in unprecedented detail, have been published in a weekly defense magazine. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weekly </ORGANIZATION> said the pictures show that the view of the plane given by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> a year ago `` was carefully selected to conceal the F-117's true shape, and made the aircraft appear much shorter and wider than it is.'' The article accompanying the two pictures was written by <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweetman </PERSON>, a leading civilian authority on the Stealth program to build bombers and fighters that can elude radar detection. One picture appeared to show the delta-winged <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> F-117A flying horizontally, while the other showed it in a vertical position. In each picture its landing gear was down and it was accompanied by a T-38 chase plane. <PERSON> Sweetman </PERSON> wrote the aircraft is coated in radar-absorbent material and `` faceted'' to discourage the scattering of radar energy toward the transmitter location. The fighter is a different aircraft from the Stealth bomber recently unveiled for TV cameras. <PERSON> Sweetman </PERSON> wrote that the fighter's overall length is 66.6 feet, wingspan is 41.6 feet and maximum takeoff weight is about 45,100 pounds. The report said two squadrons of F-117s are operational with the <ORGANIZATION> 4450th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tactical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Tonopah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev </LOCATION>. It said the last of 59 F-117s, including five test aircraft, were likely to be delivered next year. It said one test aircraft and two production planes have been lost in accidents since the jet made its first flight in October 1981.

 A state legislative committee approved and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> for debate today $ 1.1 billion in tax increases to close the budget deficit that signaled the end of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Miracle. The package of higher taxes on capital gains, sales and gasoline was approved on a voice vote Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. It immediately drew fire from both legislators and the public. `` This bill imposes the most regressive kind of a tax, hitting hardest those in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> who can least afford it,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> was scheduled to begin debate on the package today, and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders said they hoped to send it to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by the end of the week. The proposal is the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s latest move to deal with the deficit, which a <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> staffer said had swelled to $ 825 million. Only a year ago, the economic boom dubbed the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Miracle nearly carried Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to the White House. As the committee sent the proposal to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> held hearings on a $ 350 million House-approved package of spending cuts. Legislative leaders envision enacting the cuts in conjuction with the tax package, which has been embraced by the governor. Under the tax package, the sales tax would rise from five cents to seven cents on the dollar; the gas tax would go from 11 cents to 21 cents per gallon, and capital gains would be increased from 5 percent to 7.5 percent. The package would raise nearly $ 1.1 billion in additional revenue by the next fiscal year. Still more revenue would be raised by shifting $ 30 million more in cigarette taxes into the general fund and by collecting $ 24 million in unclaimed returnable-bottle deposits. The package was developed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership, and Speaker <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Keverian </PERSON> backed it up by telling several committee chairmen they should resign if they they could not support it. One committee chairman quit on Tuesday. Democratic Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonough </PERSON> spoke up for new taxes before the <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> vote, saying it was time the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and the administration corrected spending errors that were based on overly ambitious revenue estimates. `` At what point do we face up to the fact that we were all wrong about the deficit?'' he asked. Rep. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> minority leader, said the Democratic leadership's deficit estimates are designed to promote taxes. He estimated the deficit is less than $ 500 million and accused the Democratic leadership of `` twisting arms and getting that tax bill through here as quickly as possible.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, said the increase in the capital gains tax would stifle economic growth. `` We are going to ... hurt our image and make ourselves less attractive to investors from outside the state,'' he said.

 The former head librarian at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Branch </ORGANIZATION> has been charged with stealing five rare medical books from the school. <PERSON> Emil </PERSON> <PERSON> Frey </PERSON>, 62, surrendered to <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's officials Wednesday and was later released on $ 23,000 bond An indictment handed up Monday accuses <PERSON> Frey </PERSON> of stealing five of 80 books missing from the <ORGANIZATION> UTMB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION>'s 12,000-volume Truman G.

University police found several books in a private storage shed rented by <PERSON> Frey </PERSON>, said a statement issued Wednesday by the <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney's office. `` Police officials contend the books were sent to a bookseller in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for sale by <PERSON> Frey </PERSON> for his personal benefit,'' the statement said. <PERSON> Frey </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, declined to comment on the case, saying he had n't had a chance to go over the indictment in detail. <PERSON> Frey </PERSON> became director of the <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> in 1973.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> captain drilled the honor guard in crisp salutes while sailors scrubbed and painted the USS Belknap Thursday for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s shipboard summit with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The almost 600-member crew aboard the guided missile cruiser worked around visiting reporters and a tour of Soviet sailors and officers to spruce up the <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON> and prepare its rooms for the heads of state. `` Of course the real importance of this visit is not the ship itself, but the president of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> meeting on this ship,'' said Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigler </PERSON>, the commander of the Belknap. `` We feel very honored to be a part of this hopefully very historic moment,'' he added. When <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> aviator, first steps off a helicopter onto the deck of the <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON>, he'll be able to see a hand-lettered `` Beat Army'' poster pasted to a bulkhead. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will sleep in the quarters of Vice Adm. <PERSON> J.D </PERSON>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, the 6th Fleet commander, meet privately with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in the admiral's small dining room and be host for a state dinner prepared by White House chefs in the crowded confines of the officer's mess The <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON> is anchored a few hundred yards behind the Soviet missile cruiser Slava, where <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will be host on Saturday for talks with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in richly paneled wardrooms appointed with plush furniture and oriental rugs. By comparison, the site of Saturday's state dinner in the <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON> wardroom is spartan. The walls are white and wainscotted with artificial paneling. A Soviet and American flag are displayed below one porthole. Two tables, one seating 20 and the other 10, are crowded into the room along with a large milk cooler that can be hidden with a navy blue curtain. <PERSON> Sigler </PERSON>, who was to visit the <PERSON> Slava </PERSON> later Thursday, said he had heard the Soviet warship had more creature comforts. `` I heard they have a sauna for example,'' he said. `` I think we are comfortable,'' he added. `` I do n't feel at a disadvantage, I just think there is perhaps a different emphasis here than there.'' There are other, more obvious differences between the two ships. The Slava is 17 years younger than the 25-year-old <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON>, slightly longer and its decks are bristling with arms. There are 16 surface-to-surface missile tubes on the Soviet cruiser, compared to just four on the American ship. `` It's a beautiful ship,'' <PERSON> Sigler </PERSON> said of the Slava. `` Of course it is much newer than my ship and the Soviets tend to have most of their weapons topside, where we have most of ours below decks. The result is that she looks heavily armed. I think our capabilities are very similar in a lot of ways. But she certainly looks imposing.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s quarters aboard the <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON> are small and cramped. The blue-carpeted cabin has just about 20 square feet of floor space, a double bed, a gold recliner and a <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> color television with <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> VHS and <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> Beta videotape players. From his porthole on the starboard side, the president will have a view of the St. <PERSON> Luciano </PERSON> <PERSON> Watchtower </PERSON>, a 16th Century castle built by the Knights of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> on a jagged cliff that juts into <LOCATION> Marsaxlokk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> at the point closest to the American and Soviet warships. The president also will use the admiral's office, which is dominated by a large wooden desk on which sits a Christmas card addressed to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> from <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> Shewchuk </PERSON>, the 7-year-old daughter of one of the <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON>'s officers. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will be given a holding room in the chief of staff's office. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s cabin and office are one flight up a steep metal ladder from the main deck and just steps away from the admiral's mess where the two leaders will meet with just two interpreters and two people to take notes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will deliver their joint statement at the end of the summit Sunday on the <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON>'s forecastle, standing beneath the launchers for the cruiser's surface-to-air missiles. Earlier Sunday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will attend a non-denominational Protestant church service at the same site. `` I am very nervous, very nervous,'' said Lt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwabauer </PERSON>, a Presbyterian minister who is the ship's chaplain. `` The thought of preaching to the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is terrifying.''

<HEAD>List of Chinese Military Strategists Includes Lin Biao</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A list published Thursday of Chinese `` military strategists'' includes <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> <PERSON> Biao </PERSON>, the disgraced defense minister who died in a mysterious plane crash after allegedly plotting a coup against <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>. The list, published in the official <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>, also includes <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s revolutionary founder; the late premier <PERSON> Chou </PERSON> <PERSON> En-lai </PERSON>; current senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>; President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON>; and retired President <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiannian </PERSON>. According to official Chinese accounts, <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> died in September 1971 in a plane crash in <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> as he was trying to flee to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> after an unsuccessful plot to assassinate <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>. The Chinese version says the plane ran out of gas, but other reports say <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> had been shot before the plane went down, leading to speculation of a gun battle aboard the plane. A manuscript smuggled out of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was published under a pseudonym in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1983 alleging that <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> and his wife were lured to a villa outside <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and killed. The People's Daily listed the names, adding `` And there was Lin Biao'' without elaborating. Chinese historians credit <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> with being an outstanding military commander. <PERSON> Lin </PERSON>, who was one of only 10 military officers with the rank of marshal, was included in a book on the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> published in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1987. While the book said he was head of the `` Lin Biao Counterrevolutionary Clique,'' it also noted his positive role in Chinese history. He also appeared in the movie `` Grand Ceremony Establishing the Country,'' released this year to mark the 40th anniversary of the founding of Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

 A fire that damaged the home of a legislator who had tried to keep a state university from putting on a play about AIDS and homosexuality was declared accidental today. Fireplace embers dumped in the back yard Wednesday night by one of <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s children ignited leaves and scrap wood and spread to the state representative's home, Chief Fire Marshal <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bittle </PERSON> said. Arson investigators had been called in to determine whether the fire was set, like a blaze on Nov. 15 that destroyed the home of a student who had led a campaign in support of the play, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>'s `` The Normal Heart.'' Fire Chief <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> estimated damage <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s home at $ 5,000 to $ 10,000, mostly involving the attic and exterior. There were no injuries. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> and her husband were away at the time, but five <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> children ranging from 7 to 20 years old were at home with an adult friend, the fire chief said. A neighbor discovered the fire about 12:40 a.m. and alerted those inside, who included three sleeping children. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, a Republican, was among the most vocal opponents of a presentation of `` The Normal Heart'' at <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 15-20. She objected to use of a public facility for a play that presents homosexuality as an acceptable lifestyle. <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> and his supporters accused her of censorship and said the play, which quickly sold out amid the controversy, helped educate students about AIDS. The night the play opened, someone apparently set a fire at the home of <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, 22, after forcing open a back door, investigators said. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> was leading a candlelight ceremony in support of the play when the fire occurred.

<HEAD>AIDS May Relate To Deficiency Of Protein Molecule, Expert Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Reduced levels of an important protein molecule may play a role in the collapse of the immune system in patients infected with the AIDS virus, according to a study at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crystal </PERSON>, a researcher at the National Heart, Lung and <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, one of the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> agencies, said a deficit of glutathione was found in a group patients infected with the AIDS virus and he suggests that this `` may be one clue about why the immune dysfunction occurs'' in victims of the disease. In a study to be published Friday in the British medical journal <ORGANIZATION> Lancet </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION> and seven other researchers report that they measured the levels of glutathione in the blood and lung fluids of 14 patients infected with the AIDS virus and compared the results with studies of 19 patients not infected with AIDS. <PERSON> Crystal </PERSON> said that patients who were `` seropositive,'' or infected with the human immunodeficiency virus -LRB- HIV -RRB- that causes AIDS, had glutathione levels reduced by one-third to one-half of what is normal. `` What we found is that the glutachione level in seropositive people was low, suggesting a systemic deficiency of glutathione,'' said the researcher. The patients in the study infected with HIV had normal levels of lymphocytes, a disease-fighting white blood cell attacked by the AIDS virus, and their disease had not progressed to full-blown AIDS. Crystal said glutathione is a common protein molecule whose precise function in the body is not known, but earlier research has proven that it is important in the body's shield against infection. `` It seems to play an important role in allowing the immune system to function normally,'' said Crystal. `` Nobody knows why or how, but ... the immune system does better when glutathione is around. There's a lot of evidence of that.'' A deficiency of glutathione, he said, may be a clue in a medical mystery that has puzzled AIDS researchers for years. <PERSON> Crystal </PERSON> said that early in the course of an AIDS virus infection, there `` clearly is immune dysfunction,'' but, yet, there typically are very, very few cells that are actually infected with HIV. How the disease could compromise the immune system with so few `` soldiers'' attacking the body's cells has been one of the unanswered questions about AIDS, he said. `` There has got to be ways that the -LRB- HIV -RRB- infection amplifies itself in terms of its effect on the body,'' said Crystal. `` This -LRB- the glutathione deficiency -RRB- may be one clue about why the immune dysfunction occurs.'' The scientist emphasized that finding the exact role that reduced glutathione plays in the course of an AIDS virus infection will require a great deal more research before there could be any clinical application. `` We are evaluating the very important question of whether this glutathione deficiency is relevant ... or does it have nothing to do with -LRB- immune dysfunction -RRB-? That is a possibility,'' said Crystal. AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious disease that attacks the body's immune system, leaving it unable to resist other infections. HIV, which causes AIDS, is spread most often through sexual relations, through contact with blood or blood products, such as by sharing needles, or from mother to child during the birth process. As of Sept. 30, AIDS had been diagnosed in 109,167 Americans, of whom more than half, or 64,849, have died since June 1, 1981, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.

<TEXT>
 Tens of thousands of Armenians rallied Thursday in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> and demanded that their lawmakers defy <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> by declaring the disputed <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region part of a `` unified Armenian republic,'' local journalists said. Unconfirmed reports from the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> region in the southern part of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> said as many as three people were killed in violence stemming from the sovereignty quarrel over the predominantly <LOCATION> Armenian </LOCATION> district inside the neighboring republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, adding to a 22-month toll of about 100 deaths. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the Soviet legislature on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved a resolution disbanding a special commission that had imposed direct Kremlin rule on the hilly region of 160,000 people, which was made part of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> in 1923 despite its overwhelming Armenian majority. The resolution passed by the Soviet legislature says the area is part of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, as provided in the 1977 Soviet Constitution, and will now be controlled by local government bodies under the supervision of an all-union commission. Instead of calming the situation, the Supreme Soviet's resolution exacerbated it, a government spokesman said `` One has to regret that passions are flying high and the people do not understand the very meaning, the very sense, of what this decision contains,'' Foreign Ministry <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gremitskikh </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s capital, the republic's Supreme Soviet legislature and lawmakers from <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> met in a special session to debate the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> legislature's resolution, said <PERSON> Armen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dulyan </PERSON>, a spokesman for the republic's official Armenpress news agency. <PERSON> Levon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ter-Petrosyan </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, presented a draft resolution that would declare <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> part of a `` unified Armenian republic,'' <PERSON> Dulyan </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s Armenian population, supported by <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, has demanded that it be annexed to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> because of what it calls years of willful neglect by <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> authorities. `` The unified Armenian republic will take all necessary measures to defend <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> and its citizens from all outside encroachments, as part of the republic's territory,'' Dulyan quoted the resolution introduced by <PERSON> Ter-Petrosyan </PERSON> as saying. Speaking by telephone from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dulyan </PERSON> said a `` massive crowd'' of tens of thousands of Armenians rallied outside <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, where the lawmakers were meeting, to demand the resolution be adopted After hours of heated debate, the lawmakers voted to establish a commission to work through the night to draft a response to the Moscow-based Supreme Soviet's resolution, the Armenpress journalist said. In <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, businesses are reported to be on strike and freight trains bound for <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> to be idled as Azerbaijanis express displeasure with the resolution. <PERSON> Savili </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perets </PERSON>, deputy director of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>'s official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Azerinform </ORGANIZATION>, said some Azerbaijanis believe the observer commission encroaches on their republic's sovereignty and that the resolution's provision barring changes in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s demographics means <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> women can not give birth in the region Speaking by telephone from <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>'s capital of <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Perets </PERSON> said he had received unofficial reports of three people killed Tuesday in attacks related to the dispute. He could not provide details of the incidents. In <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dulyan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Armenpress </PERSON> had received news of only one death, that of a police major shot and killed on the Armenia-Azerbaijan border near the Armenian town of <LOCATION> Goris </LOCATION>. Two Armenian civilians also were seriously wounded by the unidentified gunman, who fled, he said. Activists from both sides said a general strike was under way in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. Officials of the special administrative commission have acknowledged that despite the presence of <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> soldiers, a virtual civil war has raged.

 Masked Palestinians Thursday axed a fellow <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> to death as an alleged collaborator, then discovered they killed the wrong man and declared him a `` martyr'' of their uprising, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters said. Shops and businesses in Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> closed to protest the deaths of two brothers who were shot and killed by soldiers Wednesday night for throwing stones at Israeli cars. In the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, 12 Palestinians were shot and wounded by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers in stone-throwing clashes, hospital officials said. The suspected collaborator was killed in <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iba </LOCATION>, a village of about 2,000 people near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Witnesses said seven Palestinians wearing mourning dress and checkered Arab scarves over their faces later marched through the village and announced on loudspeakers they had killed the wrong man. Arab reporters said the attackers also warned that they were still seeking the collaborator. The slain man was identified as <PERSON> Mamoun </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Masri </PERSON>, 18. The army said it was checking the reports. It confirmed the death Thursday of a suspected collaborator who was injured three days earlier in a firebomb attack. Hospital officials identified him as <PERSON> Ribhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bader </PERSON>, 33, of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Liqya </LOCATION>. The deaths raised to at least 153 the number of Palestinians killed by fellow Arabs in the uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> rule of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Most were suspected of collaboration or of drug dealing or prostitution. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and civilians have killed 617 Palestinians since the start of the revolt, and 42 Israelis have died in the violence. The deaths of the brothers Wednesday night set off a strike in <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> that merchants said would last for at least two days. <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamouri </PERSON>, 20, and <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamouri </PERSON>, 19, were buried Thursday at a family service in a <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> cemetery. Another Hamouri brother, <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> had been hit three times in the chest and that <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> was struck `` by even more bullets.'' The army said the brothers were among a group of masked youths who climbed a hill on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and threw rocks at passing Israeli cars. A patrol `` ordered them to stop and fired in the air,'' the army spokesman's office said. `` When they did n't stop they shot in their direction.'' Several youths escaped, the army said. More than a dozen Palestinians have been fatally shot by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers since mid-September, when the army changed orders to allow troops to fire on masked Arabs who flee, even if they are not armed. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> court in <LOCATION> Lod </LOCATION> on Thursday sentenced a Palestinian man to 17 years in jail for commanding a squad that threw three firebombs. He was identified as <PERSON> Hani </PERSON> <PERSON> Aouni </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON>, 30, of Beit Hanina near <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. One of the bombs was tossed at a car and a woman inside was seriously burned.

<HEAD>Environmental Concerns Will Figure Heavily in New Farm Bill, EPA
Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> official said Thursday that environmental concerns will play a key role in the 1990 farm bill. <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Habicht </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy administrator, told an agriculture conference that his agency has been working with <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> to work out proposals for the legislation, which will set farm policy for several years. He commended agricultural officials for a `` visionary view'' in response to public concerns about pesticides and food safety. `` Farmers were the first environmentalists,'' said <PERSON> Habicht </PERSON>. He said encouraging farmers to use wise environmental methods is not `` an attitude issue, but an information issue.'' Agriculture Deputy Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON>, who appeared with <PERSON> Habicht </PERSON>, took a hard line toward food safety questions raised by environmental organizations. `` Do not be afraid of your critics ... or their noise,'' he told the participants at the closing program of Outlook'90, a three-day conference sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. He said that technology has made <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> agriculture the most successful in the world, partly through use of chemicals. He cautioned against `` those who would like to tear down and destroy by quoting half truths from pseudo-scientists.'' He said breakthroughs in science have enabled researchers to detect chemical residues in food in much smaller quantities than ever before. He questioned whether ingestion of a one part per trillion of a particular residue over a 70-year lifetime should be legislated against. `` Do n't allow policy to move ahead of science or common sense,'' he said. He said he does support speedy removal from the market of chemicals that have been determined hazardous to health and hailed President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s legislative proposals for streamlining laws that do just that. `` When the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sits down to supper, it should expect a wholesome supper with the safest food in the world,'' <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON> said. Dr. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, outgoing commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, also questioned the need to be concerned about minute quantities of chemical residues in food. `` In the 1960's and 70's, we began to identify compounds that might cause cancer,'' he said. `` But we could only identify one part per 1,000 or one part per 10,000. Today, scientists can detect one part per trillion or one part per million trillion, he said. That ability has allowed residue to be detected that could not be found before but is not necessarily harmful to health, he said. `` We must be very careful that the nation's health or economy does not fall prey to self-appointed priests of demagoguery,'' said <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. <PERSON> Habicht </PERSON> acknowledged the farmer's central role in the American economy and said his agency has no interest in retarding agricultural productivity. But he said that, `` for the past 20 years, we've been identifying problems and scrambling to clean up.'' He said the policies of the future must be preventive.

<HEAD>Opening of East Bloc May Shed New Light on Holocaust</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Liberalization in the Communist bloc is providing an unexpected opportunity for historians to examine long-hidden documents on <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s extermination of European Jewry. Tens of thousands of documents from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and others expected from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> may answer such central questions as how many Jews really died, which could be more than the accepted 6 million, researchers said Thursday. Despite four decades of scholarship on the Holocaust, the unavailability of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> accounts has left gaping holes in knowledge about the World War II slaughter, said <PERSON> Shmuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Krakowsky </PERSON>, head archivist at <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial. The largest mystery has been the fate of Soviet Jews: how many were killed, how they died and where they died. `` We have never been able to compile final figures of how many died. It could be that far fewer succeeded in escaping executions than we imagined,'' <PERSON> Krakowsky </PERSON> said. Himself a survivor of the Lodz Ghetto in wartime <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Krakowsky </PERSON> is in charge of reviewing 50,000 pages of East German documents, about a third of which were brought to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> this week by archivists from <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. The documents have arrived in advance of a cooperation agreement that Israeli and East German researchers are scheduled to sign Monday. <PERSON> Krakowsky </PERSON> said he scanned some of the information while on a visit to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1988. In September, <PERSON> Krakowsky </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Yad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vashem </ORGANIZATION>'s director <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> spent three weeks studying thousands of pages of newly available Holocaust documents in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minsk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Odessa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>. The material in the Soviet and German archives suggested new directions in investigating how the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> operated in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Krakowsky </PERSON> said. `` We were astounded to read of documented persecutions, names and places we had n't been aware of,'' he said. `` It adds a lot to our information about the Holocaust. Until now knowledge of the fate of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jewry </LOCATION> in the war has been scant.'' <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> <PERSON> Altshuler </PERSON>, an expert on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said the documents may establish a firmer figure on deaths than the current range of 1.25 million to 1.8 million. <PERSON> Altshuler </PERSON> said this could affect the overall estimte of 6 million dead. `` More material on the subject could change the picture one way or the other,'' he said. <PERSON> Krakowsky </PERSON> said it was premature to make a new estimate, but added he believed the death toll could be larger than believed. `` We saw names of death sites we had n't seen before and lists of names,'' he said. Another question raised is what kind of extermination methods the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> used in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and what role local collaborators were given, <PERSON> Krakowsky </PERSON> said. Until now it was believed that Russian Jewry perished mostly at the hands of German firing squads known as <ORGANIZATION> Einsatzgruppen </ORGANIZATION> who mowed them down at the edge of huge dirt pits in the initial stages of the war. `` It seems the process -LRB- in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> -RRB- may have been lengthier, with a wider use of gathering Jews first in ghettos and hiring local police to do some of the killing,'' <PERSON> Krakowsky </PERSON> said. He noted that some Soviet documents indicate there were more sites for rounding up Jews in towns and cities than previously thought. <PERSON> Karkowsky </PERSON> cited the town of <LOCATION> Homel </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION> where historians believed the Germans had organized one Jewish ghetto. New documents showed there were four ghettoes, suggesting more Jews may have been killed there than believed, he said. East German documents also may shed light on <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> theoretician <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, who was in charge of destroying synagogues, and on the shadowy alliance between <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s late Moslem Mufti, <PERSON> Haj </PERSON> <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, <PERSON> Krakowsky </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> also has begun contributing to knowledge of the Holocaust by agreeing to send an exhibition of wartime Judaic relics from <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The items scheduled for display next April are `` part of an enormous collection that the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> had amassed for a memorial to an extinguished people,'' according to museum director <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Meir </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The Energy Department today said it is suspending some plutonium operations at Rocky Flats while a new contractor takes over at the weapons plant, which is under <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation for alleged safety violations. <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaliniak </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said a `` major curtailment'' of plutonium operations at the plant will be completed sometime next week. The plant makes plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Kaliniak </PERSON> would not disclose how many plutonium operations will continue, saying that was classified information. Last year the plant was shut down temporarily after a safety violation. The move came amid a rash of safety and management problems, interruptions and shutdowns at the 16 major facilities in 12 states involved in making nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Kaliniak </PERSON> said the Rocky Flats suspension had nothing to do with safety concerns, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simonson </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> office at Rocky Flats, said the move is part of the process by which <ORGANIZATION> EG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is taking over from <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> as operator of the plant 16 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. `` The department is using this transition period to work with <ORGANIZATION> EG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; G to establish a formal, structured program for the resumption of nuclear facility operations,'' <PERSON> Simonson </PERSON> said. `` The program now under development with <ORGANIZATION> EG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; G will ensure that future operations are governed by the highest standards of performance.'' Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON>, D-Colo., had announced Wednesday that he asked Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> in a Nov. 16 letter to halt production at Rocky Flats Hours later, <PERSON> Simonson </PERSON> said the plant was already in the midst of a production curtailment that was scheduled in August, began Nov. 13 and would continue through mid-January. <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON>, whose district includes the plant, said later Wednesday that the curtailment `` falls far short of what I have called for.'' <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON> said an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report last month indicated only luck has prevented a serious accident at Rocky Flats. He said the report concluded the fail-safe system at the plant is flawed and does not follow accepted nuclear industry standards and that the plant does not have adequate control over its plutonium stock. <PERSON> Simonson </PERSON> maintained that <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> has ordered `` essentially all the recommendations mentioned by Congressman <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON> in his Nov. 16 letter.'' <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents earlier this year raided Rocky Flats for evidence of safety and environmental violations. Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> would visit Rocky Flats on Friday and make more information available on the plant's safety. Ms. <PERSON> Kaliniak </PERSON> said she could not confirm that <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> was even considering such a visit. On a related issue, <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON> say they have concluded there were no illegal midnight burnings of toxic waste inside a top-secret building at the plant. The allegation, denied for months by <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, surfaced in an affidavit the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> filed to support search warrants for a June 6 raid on the plant.

<HEAD>Governor Wants Dolphins Released</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> has accused one of the world's leading aquariums of illegally taking two bottlenose dolphins from <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, but aquarium officials say it's all a misunderstanding. The governor directed officials Wednesday to find out if the state can force release of the animals and to draft rules restricting the capture and transportation of dolphins from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> waters. The National Aquarium in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> did not have the correct state permit when it moved two male dolphins captured Sunday in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> to a holding facility at Marathon in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION>, said officials with the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was a breach of state law and worse yet, it flies in the face of our efforts to protect these special mammals,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> wrote in his letter to <ORGANIZATION> DNR </ORGANIZATION> executive director <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said he has asked his attorneys to investigate the situation. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquarium </ORGANIZATION> said the only problem was a technical flaw in their permit. `` We've been so meticulous and careful about every single aspect of the collection process,'' said aquarium spokeswoman <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Aversa </PERSON>. `` It's just a shame that this kind of situation has to happen.'' State and federal officials said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON>, a marine mammal veterinarian, had a federal permit to capture up to three dolphins anywhere along the Gulf Coast. But a state permit is needed to move the dolphins, and the permit <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON> obtained specified that he could transport dolphins only from <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Lee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s southwest coast. <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON> moved the animals from <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> on Tuesday without amending the permit, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Futch </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> DNR </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant director of marine resources. Ms. <PERSON> Aversa </PERSON> said the capture site was moved to <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> because of criticism raised over the plan to take dolphins from the <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> Aquatic Preserve. Ms. <PERSON> Aversa </PERSON> added that <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON> had been given verbal permission by the DNR to move the mammals from <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. There was no comment from <LOCATION> Sweeney </LOCATION>; neither acquarium nor state officials knew where he was Thursday. Ms. <PERSON> Aversa </PERSON> said the dolphins will stay at Marathon for most of the winter unless the state forces the aquarium to release them.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration sharply criticized a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency Thursday for strengthening its cooperation with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and denying a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official the agency's chairmanship. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said that, in light of the agency's actions, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was considering cutting off all financial support for the Food and <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. At a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> FAO </ORGANIZATION>'s general conference in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, 96 countries voted for a resolution authorizing the agency to assist agricultural development on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> `` in close cooperation'' with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The resolution accused <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which controls the territories, of hampering economic development and denying land and water to <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> residents. `` The outcome of the conference was unacceptable to us for a number of reasons,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. She called the resolution `` extremely objectionable'' and accused the <ORGANIZATION> FAO </ORGANIZATION> of lagging behind in reforming its procedures and expanding its budget at the expense of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and a handful of other countries that bear most of the costs. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Amstutz </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had been denied his right under a rotation system to serve as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> FAO </ORGANIZATION> council. Referring to these actions, the spokeswoman said `` this brings into serious question our funding of <ORGANIZATION> FAO </ORGANIZATION>. This is being seriously discussed here today, but I am not prepared at this briefing to make an announcement of what action or actions the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be taking.'' On another <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> issue, Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said Egyptian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Meguid </PERSON> had informed Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> that he could not approve a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal for setting up negotiations between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and Palestinians. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> has been dealing with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> in behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Evidently, <PERSON> Meguid </PERSON> requested some unspecified changes in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> approach. But Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said any `` clarifications'' would be considered only after <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> gave its `` yes'' to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan. The Israeli Cabinet earlier gave its approval, but also stated a number of reservations. Its main concern is that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> not play a role in the negotiations. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, however, is recognized by all <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> countries as the only legitimate representative of the Palestinians.

 A renegade <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent who defected to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> after allegedly passing secrets has been expelled from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, a newspaper reported today. It was not known where the defector, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, went after his expulsion, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, who eluded <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> counterintelligence agents in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in 1985, revealed to the Soviets the names of people and technical equipment being used by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official told the Times that federal authorities had been trying to persuade <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to expel <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> for months. The newspaper said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is stepping up its efforts to apprehend <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. `` Our argument was, ` Here's this guy who cast his lot with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> but tried to avoid the hardships of Gulag socialism,''' the unidentified official was quoted as saying. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> revoked his asylum at least a month ago despite protests by the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>, the Soviet intelligence agency, according to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government source quoted by the newspaper. Asked about the report, <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt.

<TEXT>
 This steel and coal town in <LOCATION> Moravia </LOCATION> has always been a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> stronghold, but even new party leader <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON>'s roots in the region are n't enough to stem the quest for reform. The winds of change are strong even in this major industrial center, although `` we are always days behind <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Dusan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kubat </PERSON>, a journalist and staunch supporter of the Civic Forum reform movement. Civic Forum was a major force in the pro-democracy demonstrations that led to the downfall of former party chief <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>. He was replaced by <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON>, who is from <LOCATION> Bojkovice </LOCATION>, a village in southern <LOCATION> Moravia </LOCATION>. `` The situation is more complicated here,'' said <PERSON> Kubat </PERSON>, 30. `` People are more conservative. But I think most workers are already with us.'' Workers crowding a beer hall appeared to support his assessment. `` I am happy that the young ones started the fight,'' said steelworker <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Koukl </PERSON>. `` I am already 40 but I would like to join them. Everybody who has a sense of justice should join them.'' <PERSON> Stanislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Novak </PERSON>, a 40-year-old father of two, put down his glass of plum brandy and nodded: `` I would like my children to live in a better world.'' The Civic Forum's call for a two-hour general strike Monday was heeded by most plants here, with at least 20,000 workers taking to the streets after sirens signaled the start. At the Zarubek coal mine, however, the management `` did not let us gather and waited until the last moment before it allowed a group of miners to come up to take part in the strike,'' said a technician met at the gate, who refused to give his name. A rumor spread among miners before the strike that participants would lose their Christmas bonus of up to $ 900. Miners draw up to three times the national worker's pay. Once they work above ground, however, their wage is slashed substantially unless they are diagnosed to be suffering from silicosis. Complaints from their ranks that silicosis victims are increasingly being refused full pay were cited as a factor prompting the large miner participation in the strike. The local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> organized a rally Wednesday on <LOCATION> Ostrava </LOCATION>'s People's Militia Square, at which traditional overall-clad workers were noticeably absent. One speaker was worker <PERSON> Jaroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Cahlik </PERSON>, who called on the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> government `` to immediately stop the talks'' with the opposition. The mostly middle-aged crowd of about 5,000, including a group of army officers, broke into chants of `` Long live the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. We are still here,'' while a group of about 100 younger onlookers rose their arms in the `` victory'' sign of the opposition. `` They may still be here, but without power,'' said one bystander. <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Hnikova </PERSON>, a 29-year-old textile worker, joined in the pro-party chants. `` I will be with the party no matter what happens,'' she said. `` Of course there have been mistakes, but that will change now,'' she added after a brown-coated man whispered something into her ear. <LOCATION> Ostrava </LOCATION> has a mining engineering college where students are on an indefinite strike to press for the resignation of their rector, an orthodox Communist. The strike is being led by a teacher of Marxism-Leninism. Most of the mines in the region are no longer profitable but the party has opposed shutting them down for fear of stirring discontent. Their future is likely to figure in upcoming discussions about economic reforms. `` I am afraid that the economic situation will become worse,'' said mechanic <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Mlynar </PERSON> outside <LOCATION> Ostrava </LOCATION>'s Hotel Atom as smoke billowed from a nearby blast furnace. `` The changes are so fast,'' said passerby <PERSON> Ondreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Imrich </PERSON>. `` I still fear that everything will end in a dead-end street again or that it will be suppressed.''

 Consumer spending fell to its lowest level in nearly three years in October, the government said Thursday, and analysts said continued sluggishness in personal consumption is likely to be a `` major drag'' on the economy in the fourth quarter. On the other hand, personal income rose a healthy 0.9 percent, which analysts said indicates consumers still have spending power, but are just waiting for bargains. `` It's not going to be a great Christmas in terms of shopping and -LRB- retail -RRB- earnings,'' said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consulting firm. `` People will just wait until things go on sale.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that spending, reflecting plummeting auto sales in October, dropped 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 3.53 trillion after edging up only 0.3 percent in September. It was the first decline in personal spending since a 0.1 percent drop in September 1988 and the steepest since a 1.4 percent fall in January 1987. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's economic activity and the spending report provided fresh evidence that the economy is continuing to slow `` Consumer spending is starting the fourth quarter on an extremely weak note,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` And since it represents two-thirds of the gross national product, I think it will be a major drag on the economy in the fourth quarter.'' Income, on the other hand, totaled $ 4.51 trillion, reflecting the largest advance since a 1 percent gain last March. It had risen 0.3 percent in September. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay-area </LOCATION> earthquake knocked $ 21 billion out of the income figure at an annual rate, but that was partially offset by other one-time `` special factors,'' including a $ 7.2 billion increase in farm subsidies and $ 6.8 billion in bonuses to auto industry employees. `` Excluding the impact of the special factors, personal income increased about $ 33 billion, or 0.7 percent,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON>, while expecting a weak fourth-quarter economy, said the report by itself does not indicate an imminent recession. `` First, income numbers have been too strong to be consistent with a recession,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON> said. `` And, on the other hand, people are still spending ... they're just being very, very cautious ... waiting for things to go on sale.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> agreed, saying that consumers still have buying power but are `` more cautious, and they want to bargain.'' Americans' incomes after taxes rose 0.9 percent, up from September's 0.2 percent gain, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> said. Their savings rate, savings as a percent of disposable income, rose to 5.7 percent, the highest since a 5.8 percent rate last June and compared to September's 4.7 percent. The key component of the income category _ wages and salaries _ rose $ 33 billion, compared to a $ 17 billion gain in September. Payrolls at manufacturing companies rose by $ 6.8 billion, but would have been flat except for the $ 6.8 billion in auto bonuses. The manufacturing sector has been one of the hardest hit by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> efforts to fight inflation. On the spending side, the $ 6.1 billion decrease in personal consumption, which includes everything except interest payments on debt, compared to a $ 9.9 billion gain in September when incentives drove auto sales up. Purchases of durable goods, big-ticket items expected to last more than three years, dropped $ 28.2 billion, while non-durable goods purchases rose $ 2.5 billion. Spending on services rose $ 20.2 billion.

<HEAD>Police Confirm Arrest of Ex-Detective in Slayings of White Activists</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A former narcotics detective has been arrested in the assassinations of two prominent white activists, one in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, police said Thursday. Police headquarters refused to release the name of the 31-year-old suspect, saying it confirmed his arrest only after newspapers reported it. An official statement said further arrests in the slayings were possible. An evening news report on government-run TV said it was believed police `` are looking at the possible existence of a private assassination squad with strong right-wing links.'' The suspect, a white former police sergeant, was arrested this month in the killings of <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, a university lecturer and human rights activist in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubowski </PERSON>, a lawyer who was the only senior white official of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s main independence movement, the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Both men were shot to death outside their homes; <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> on May 1 in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lubowski </PERSON> on Sept. 12 in <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The suspect had not been charged and was being held for questioning under the provisions of security legislation that allows for indefinite detention without access to visitors or lawyers. The Star, a liberal <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> daily, said the suspect's father had filed an application demanding his son's release from a <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> police station cell, but later withdrew the request Police said the suspect was discharged from the police force in 1984 after being sentenced to prison on charges of murder and theft. He was convicted of killing a suspect in one of his investigations as a narcotics officer for the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rand </LOCATION>, a region west of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. `` The person has been in detention for some time,'' police said. `` The police did not wish to announce his detention because this would have jeopardized an investigation which still has to be launched.'' The national police force has come under widespread criticism for its failure to solve the <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> murder and dozens of other killings of anti-apartheid activists over the past 10 years. The arrest coincides with a government investigation into allegations by former policemen that police death squads, acting on orders from superiors, killed numerous government opponents. An Irish national, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Acheson </PERSON>, 51, was arrested in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> the day after <PERSON> Lubowski </PERSON> was killed. He had been held as an illegal immigrant, but on Nov. 6 was told he would be charged in the slaying. Newspapers have reported that <PERSON> Acheson </PERSON> was taken to <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> for interrogation by authorities who fought the court application for the ex-narcotics officer's release. Those authorities also are investigating <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>'s assassination. Also on Thursday: _ Scores of protesting black bakery workers in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> reportedly were injured and 200 arrested by riot police using tear gas and clubs. Police said five officers were hurt by bread crates hurled from rooftops. Hundreds of workers gathered at the <LOCATION> Boerstra </LOCATION> bakery in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> to protest working conditions. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions, said riot police attacked the workers without provocation. Police said the protesters ignored repeated warnings to disperse. _ Police in the impoverished township of <LOCATION> Alexandra </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse 500 blacks protesting living conditions in their township. Four people reportedly were arrested. _ Six anti-apartheid activists met with <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and later said they did not believe he would be freed from prison this year. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nair </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> province leader of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> military wing, did not comment on the more prominent expectation that <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> would be freed early next year. President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said, `` The matter is receiving attention. ... We will make an announcement when we are ready.'' _ <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> prepared to travel to the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> for a meeting Friday with President <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Houphouet-Boigny </PERSON> to discuss mutual relations and the Angolan civil war. The two countries have no formal diplomatic relations, but extensive trade ties. <PERSON> Houphouet-Boigny </PERSON> condemns apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s legal system of racial separation, but criticizes as counterproductive sanctions to force <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to give equal rights to its black majority.

 Long experienced in dealing with invaders, the Maltese are blocking off roads and mobilizing the military _ and even the boy scouts _ to get ready for this weekend's superpower summit. They're also churning out T-shirts. Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenech </PERSON> <PERSON> Adami </PERSON> declared his island nation set for the arrivals Friday of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for their talks aboard warships anchored in a Maltese harbor. `` The arrangements have gone beautifully,'' <PERSON> Fenech </PERSON> <PERSON> Adami </PERSON> told a news conference Thursday. <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>'s entire 1,200-man military and most of its 1,000 police officers have been assigned to security tasks for the meeting, manning roadblocks and checkpoints and making round-the-clock patrols on land and at sea. Even a shortage of tiny, wavable <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> flags has n't been enough to hamper the preparations, said <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafrace </PERSON>, who reports selling 160 American and Maltese flags a day from his little toy store behind the Palace of the Grand Masters in <LOCATION> Valletta </LOCATION>. `` They never sent the Russian ones,'' <PERSON> Stafrace </PERSON> said of his Italian suppliers. `` When Soviet sailors come ashore, they normally do n't have money and want to exchange. I traded for some pennants with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s face on them. But I've sold all them already.'' The Maltese government has come up with enough large <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags to decorate the public buildings in <LOCATION> Valletta </LOCATION>, a capital of steep narrow streets lined with ocher stone buildings. The stark, almost treeless setting could be mistaken for <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, if it were n't for the Christmas decorations strung across the main shopping streets in this heavily Roman Catholic country. And the signs in the distinctive Maltese language, influenced by Arabic, Italian, French and English. St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Street </PERSON>, for instance, becomes Triq <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gwann </LOCATION>. At a shop around the corner from <LOCATION> Triq </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gwann </LOCATION> and just up from the deep harbor, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Civelli </PERSON> also had no Soviet flags, but was making up for it with colorful T-shirts showing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> floating along in separate fishing boats, shaking hands over the water in front of a Maltese cross. `` The whole world is looking at <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, I think. It's great,'' said <PERSON> Civelli </PERSON>. `` Tell your president to bring peace to the whole world. We've suffered a lot from wars.'' <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>'s wars began thousands of years ago, with Greeks, <ORGANIZATION> Etruscans </ORGANIZATION>, Carthaginians, Romans, <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> and Normans among the conquerors. In the 16th century, the knights of the Order of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> _ later known as the Knights of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> _ built the impressive fortresses that still dominate <PERSON> Valletta </PERSON>'s rocky skyline, and fought off the Ottoman Turks. <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> eventually kicked out the Knights of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, then Lord <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> kicked out the French. <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> was still under British rule through World War II, during which it survived ferocious bombing to remain a key Allied outpost in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, just 58 miles south of <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>. Among the buildings badly damaged by German and Italian bombing was the 16th century hospital of the Knights of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, now rebuilt into a conference center. Its 530-foot-long Main <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> has been lined with tables and telephones for the 2,000 journalists accredited to cover the Gorbachev-Bush encounter from shore. Joining them are promoters of Maltese business opportunities eager to take advantage of the sudden attention _ and a few dozen khaki-clad scouts given the week off from school to run errands at the center. The Soviet missile cruiser Slava and the USS Belknap, a guided missile cruiser, are anchored in <LOCATION> Marsaxlokk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, a harbor at the southern tip of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, about a 30-minute drive from <LOCATION> Valletta </LOCATION>. Two small Maltese patrol boats sailed around the two warships Thursday, making sure no pleasure boats wandered nearby. Troops were stationed at <LOCATION> Marsaxlokk </LOCATION> to ensure security on land, and extra helicopter patrols of the area began Thursday, said Brig. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiteri </PERSON>, commander of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>'s armed forces. <PERSON> Spiteri </PERSON>, in charge of security for the summit, said Maltese officers began a thorough search of the airport Thursday in cooperation with American and Soviet experts. Patrols also watch the airport perimeter around the clock, he said. Some roads are already blocked to traffic, and more will be shut through the weekend, forcing the Anglican Cathedral in <LOCATION> Valletta </LOCATION> to cancel church services this Sunday. Still, hundreds of curious tourists and local people have already made the trek to look out from a once-sleepy fishing village at the ships bristling with armaments in the harbor. With many more rubberneckers expected Saturday and Sunday, the Maltese government has lined up several local bands and scheduled fireworks at <LOCATION> Marsaxlokk </LOCATION> to keep people occupied while they wait for history to be made offshore.

<HEAD>Former Law Student Ruled Out as Suspect in Serial Murders</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A man once identified as a `` viable suspect'' in the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> serial killings is no longer a suspect, the commander of a task force investigating the slayings said today. King County Police Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> told KING-TV that records removed from <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s home and other information gathered by detectives eliminated <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> as a suspect. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, 39, is in jail awaiting trial on federal firearms charges involving guns found in a search of his and his parents' homes in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> police <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, who was arrested in January, was investigated in connection with the deaths and disappearances of 49 women, most of them prostitutes, who vanished from 1982 to 1984, mostly in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area. The case, named for the river where the first five victims were found, is the worst known, unsolved serial murder case in the nation. An affidavit filed by the task force to obtain the search warrant identified <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> as a `` viable suspect'' in the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> slayings. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> was never charged with any of the killings and has said he is innocent. The search of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' and his parents' homes uncovered guns, boxes of pornographic tapes, police paraphernalia and uniforms, and credit card records that helped investigators trace <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' travels They also found a car equipped much like a police cruiser. <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> investigators have speculated that the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> killer posed as a police officer to trap his victims. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> was indicted in October on charges of being a felon in possession of a firearm. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, a former law student at <ORGANIZATION> Gonzaga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, had escaped from a work-release center in 1981 while serving time for a 1979 burglary at a police equipment supply company.

<HEAD>States Reap $1.4 Billion Windfall as U.S. Forgives Penalties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> are the biggest winners, but all states will reap dividends from a decision by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> forgiving $ 1.4 billion in hotly-contested federal penalties under a huge family aid program. The penalties were owed by all 50 states because of alleged overpayments to beneficiaries under Aid to Families With Dependent Children, the federal-state welfare program for children who lack parental financial support. About 3.7 million families receive AFDC, the nation's largest cash assistance program. The biggest penalty to be wiped out belonged to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> _ $ 308.7 million, according to <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> For </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION>, a research group. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> owed $ 285.9 million, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> $ 134.0 million and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> $ 104.6 million. No state had avoided the penalties, although <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> owed a just $ 13,000 and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> owed $ 18,000. Forgiving the debts and reforming the way states are penalized for overpayments `` is extremely significant,'' said <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelrine </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is something we've been pushing for for years It's a tough, technical, gut-it-out issue,'' she said. `` We were delightfully surprised,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, deputy secretary for income maintenance at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>, which owed $ 92.3 million. `` Obviously if we were forced to pay up, it would have made our system hemorrhage. It would have been disastrous,'' <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> said. He said the state had been preparing to challenge the debt in court. The $ 1.4 billion is an estimate that includes only state overpayments made from the 1981 through the 1987 fiscal years. When figures for the 1988 and 1989 fiscal years are totaled, the amount of forgiveness could run as high as $ 2.2 billion, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>. The AFDC amnesty provision was contained in a $ 14.7 billion budget bill passed by both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last week in the rush to adjourn before Thanksgiving. <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> had backed a cheaper AFDC plan that did not include a full waiver of states' obligations, according to <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Delores </PERSON> <PERSON> Spitznagel </PERSON>. Still, she said, the budget measure is expected to be signed by the president. The revenue losses caused by the amnesty plan are more than offset in the measure by dozens of deficit-reduction provisions, including the extension into February of spending cuts imposed in October under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. The issue of AFDC overpayments has long caused rancor between states and the federal government. Since federal money is involved, the government monitors the program and assesses penalties when states accidentally make overpayments to beneficiaries or grant aid to people who do not qualify. Under program regulations in effect since 1983, any state with an error rate of 3 percent or above is subject to penalties and interest. But states have long held that the 3 percent `` tolerance level'' is arbitrary and ignores the realities of administering the program. States cite compliance figures showing that 41 states could not manage error rates of less than 3 percent in any year during the period. The new program enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> eliminates the 3 percent error rate, replacing it with a 4 percent figure or the national average, whichever is higher. Penalties would be assessed on a sliding scale reflecting the degree to which a state's errors exceed the national rate. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Support </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the division of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> that oversees <ORGANIZATION> AFDC </ORGANIZATION>, _ said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> apparently decided to give the program a fresh start. `` This gives all levels of government the opportunity to start with a clean slate and have a quality-control system that is operational and functional,'' <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> said. The new system begins in October 1991.

 The Japanese again reached into the upper echelons of the world art market Thursday, outbidding a Parisian dealer to buy a <ORGANIZATION> Picasso </ORGANIZATION> masterpiece for $ 48.9 million _ a record for a work by the artist. `` <PERSON> Pierrette </PERSON>'s Wedding,'' a long-disappeared masterpiece from <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>'s famed blue period, was bought by <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Autopolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in an auction linking bidders in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> by live satellite TV.

When the bidding topped <PERSON> Odermatt </PERSON>'s offer of $ 45.9 million, he paused for several seconds. The standing-room-only room packed with celebrities fell silent. <PERSON> Odermatt </PERSON> finally shook his gray head, indicating he would go no higher. Auctioneer <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Binoche </PERSON> banged the gavel, and the painting belonged to the Japanese company. `` Of course I'm very disappointed, especially since I was so close to getting it,'' <PERSON> Odermatt </PERSON> said in an interview. `` During the few seconds I hesitated _ and I knew everyone was waiting _ I kept thinking about the condition of the painting. That's what finally made me decide to let it go.'' <PERSON> Odermatt </PERSON> said pre-sale estimates that the painting would go for $ 50 million to $ 70 million were not justified. `` I spent half an hour last night examining the work, and it was worn and awfully varnished,'' he said. `` If it had been in perfect condition, the sky was the limit.'' The poignant group portrait painted in 1905 will have a new home in a specially built museum located in an auto-racing theme resort in the mountains of southern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` We felt we absolutely must have the real thing, a real masterpiece like this for our museum,'' said <PERSON> Takeshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Inaba </PERSON>, senior managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Autopolis </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're very happy to have bought the painting.'' The previous <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> record was held by `` <PERSON> Yo </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>,'' which sold for $ 47.85 million at <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s in May. The record for any work of art _ $ 53.9 million dollars _ was set in 1987 for <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s `` Irises.'' Thursday's sale also included a series of 26 paintings by American pop artist <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> titled `` Ladies and Gentlemen.'' They were sold in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> for prices ranging from between one-half to two-thirds their pre-sale estimates. `` It was a big mistake to auction the Warhols in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>,'' said French collector <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Lesieutre </PERSON>. `` They would have brought top dollar in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Lesieutre </PERSON> called the price paid for the <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> ridiculously low. `` It's a gift, a giveaway. It's a masterpiece and should have brought much more, but the French are afraid of big money,'' he said. On hand for the sale was <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Paloma </PERSON>, who blamed the lack of excitement and relatively low price on the presence of TV cameras. `` The atmosphere was cold,'' she said. `` <PERSON> Pierrette </PERSON>'s Wedding'' is considered one of <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>'s most important paintings because of its unusually large size, its hauntingly beautiful blues and pinks, and its harlequin theme. The painting shows six figures, probably circus performers, sitting around a table celebrating with an unsmiling newlywed couple. The bride, her head draped with a Spanish-style mantilla, has eyes only for her lover, whom she has abandoned to marry an older, richer man pictured in a top hat. `` It's a transitional painting that announces all the colors and forms that will dominate <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>'s works for years to come,'' said <PERSON> Isabelle </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Wavrin </PERSON>, art critic for Beaux Arts Magazine. The painting was put up for sale by Swedish industrialist <PERSON> Frederik </PERSON> <PERSON> Roos </PERSON>, who acquired it in 1988. The painting was granted a visa to leave <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> only after <PERSON> Roos </PERSON> donated another <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> from the blue period, `` La Celestine,'' to the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION>. Although art historians are familiar with the dozens of sketches <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> drew in preparation for `` <PERSON> Pierrette </PERSON>'s Wedding,'' the final work disappeared years ago, changing hands many times before surfacing in 1988 in a Picasso retrospective.

 Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> proposed Thursday that a summit of European nations, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> be held next year to speed up the integration of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and eliminate East-West divisions. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the meeting he called `` <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> 2'' should be moved up from 1992 as originally called for under the 1975 <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accords </ORGANIZATION> on human rights and security in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He made the proposal in a speech from the Michelangelo-designed Campidoglio, <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s city hall, where the treaty was signed in 1957 establishing the European Common Market. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the sweeping changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are irrevocable. He insisted they do not signal `` the collapse of socialism,'' but rather the further development of a concept with noble goals and `` enormous humanistic and democratic potential.'' On the eve of his historic meeting with Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said that Soviets have changed their attitude toward religion and now believe religious values can help in the restructuring of Soviet society. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s 20-minute speech, delivered while standing in front of a 12-foot-high statue of <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON>, was interrupted three times by applause from several hundred dignitaries. At the end, they stood and clapped politely. Expanding on his desire to build `` a common European home,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said recent events, presumably the dramatic rush toward reform in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, `` underscore the desirability of an all-European summit, a <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> 2 meeting. We could consider advancing its date from 1992 to, say, as early as 1990.'' The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had been pressing for an international human rights conference to be held in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> next year as part of the process leading toward the next 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The conference last met in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> in 1975, when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and all European countries except <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION> signed the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Accords concerning military security, economic cooperation and human rights. `` In the final analysis,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said, `` we envision <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as a commonwealth of sovereign democratic states with a high level of equitable interdependence and easily accessible borders open to the exchange of products, technologies and ideas and wide-ranging contacts among people.'' Although he did not repeat it in his speech Thursday, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has said it is prepared to negotiate dissolution of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has rejected the suggestion pending further progress in nuclear and conventional arms control talks. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who was baptized in the Russian Orthodox Church but rose through the ranks of the officially atheist <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the Soviets `` have abandoned the claim to have a monopoly on the truth. We no longer think that we are the best and that we are always right, that those who disagree with us are our enemies.'' And he said Soviets have changed their attitude toward religion, `` which, admittedly, we used to treat in a simplistic manner.'' Religion has been rejected to some extent in all major social upheavals, not just the Communist revolution, he said. `` But now we not only proceed from the assumption that no one should interfere in matters of the individual's conscience; we also say that the moral values which religion generated and embodied for centuries can help in the work of renewal in our country, too. In fact, this is already happening.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> goes to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> on Friday for the first meeting between the pope and a Soviet Communist Party chief. On Saturday, he begins a two-day summit with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on ships in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> rejected suggestions that removal of barriers between East and West can only be accomplished if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> abandons its ideological and social values. `` Frankly, we are often told that we should purely and simply renounce socialism,'' he said. `` Then, it is said, the world will become a nice and easy place to live in. ... This is not the approach that the world needs as it is taking a great turn to a new era.'' `` Today, the focus is on the socialist world,'' he said. `` Having embarked upon the road of radical reform, the socialist countries, one after another, are crossing the line beyond which there is no return to the past.'' `` Nevertheless,'' he said, `` it is wrong to insist, as many in the West do, that this is the collapse of socialism, the end of the socialist system. On the contrary, it means that the socialist process in the world, having accumulated extensive, although admittedly dramatic experience, will pursue its further development in a multiplicity of forms.'' Referring to his meetings with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he is convinced the talks will `` enable us to take a new constructive step in the movement from mutual understanding to mutual action in Soviet-U. relations.'' Earlier in the day, at the conclusion of two days of high-level talks, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> issued a statement saying that `` curtain of mistrust between the East and the West is crumbling.'' In an accompanying accord signed by the foreign ministers of both countries, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> offered to help the Soviets convert military plants to civilian use.

<HEAD>State Eases Restrictions on Polish, Hungarian Reporters</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it would allow journalists from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to apply for passes enabling them to move around the building unescorted. `` This step is being decided in light of the momentous steps toward freedom which have already taken place in both <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>, the department's spokeswoman.

In May 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attempted to strengthen security at the building by barring unescorted visits by journalists from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>.

 Suburban postal carriers had such good results paying their customers for wrongly delivered mail that the program, intended as only a 60-day trial, will continue indefinitely, officials say. Since late September, every properly addressed letter delivered to the wrong address in suburban <LOCATION> Worthington </LOCATION> has cost carriers 25 cents out of their own pockets, but most carriers say they do n't mind They say their reputations are at stake. `` It's just a small way of telling our patrons that we are concerned about our jobs, and we try to do a decent job,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, a letter carrier for six years. `` We want them to know the whole postal system is not lousy.'' The 60-day trial program, modeled on one in Highpoint, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, was supposed to end last Saturday. Union and postal officials say the program has been successful considering the 125,000 pieces of mail the branch handles a day. `` People are taking a lot of pride in what they do, and it's worked well for them,'' said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gulley </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Letter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carriers </ORGANIZATION> local that represents <LOCATION> Worthington </LOCATION> branch employees <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said he had only one errant delivery during the two months of the program. `` I must have misread it,'' he said. During the first 60 days of the program, participating postal workers paid customers a total of $ 11 for 44 pieces of wrongly delivered mail, station manager <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Summers </PERSON> said. Most of the mistakes occurred in the past three weeks as substitutes filled in for vacations and illness of regular carriers, he said. The number of customer complaints has dropped from an average of 10 calls per week to one call a week since the program began, <PERSON> Summers </PERSON> said. Of the branch's 45 mail carriers, 25 participated in the program. Carriers at the station Wednesday who did not participate declined to be interviewed. <PERSON> Gulley </PERSON> said many carriers have high-volume business routes with mail bundled by other employees and do n't want to be responsible for someone else's mistakes. Carrier <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> offered another reason for program holdouts. `` It's the holidays, and I think a lot of people are afraid to join. A lot of them are on new routes, and they do n't want to be broke for Christmas. Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a letter carrier for three years, said her customers praised the program, and most assured her they would never turn her in. But Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said she paid 25 cents to a business customer during the program. `` I do n't know if I was the one that delivered that day, but I was the one they put down,'' she said. The program began after a local magazine chided the branch for its poor service, <PERSON> Summers </PERSON> said. He said carriers read about a similar program in Highpoint, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and decided to try and salvage their reputations. The Highpoint program started last Dec. 23 with about 28 city and rural carriers of 79 total routes participating. So far, they've paid customers 78 quarters, said postmaster <PERSON> Enola </PERSON> <PERSON> Mixon </PERSON>. About 15 carriers have not paid out any quarters. `` We got, I do n't know how many nice compliments, the customers thought it was just great,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mixon </PERSON> said. From Dec. 23 to Jan. 24, they delivered more than a million pieces of mail and gave out 37 quarters, mostly on routes handled by substitutes. If substitutes did n't participate in the program, the quarter was paid by management and the union president at the time. Officials will meet in the next couple of weeks to assess the Highpoint program and see if any changes need to be made. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service officials and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Letter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carriers </ORGANIZATION>, which represents mail carriers, said they were not aware of similar programs elsewhere in the nation.

 East German authorities Thursday stripped former leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> of immunity from criminal charges and began an investigation of alleged abuses of power by <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> other disgraced <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials. Authorities also sealed off a country estate where <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> and other ousted leaders have lived, apparently to prevent removal of evidence. The moves were the strongest indications to date that the former leadership will be made to account for alleged abuses. `` Everyone is equal before the law,'' <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <ORGANIZATION> Egon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> said on national television. He said the accusations against <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> and others are `` serious and unworthy of a Politburo member.'' The official <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported later that more than 10,000 East Germans marched in the city of <LOCATION> Erfurt </LOCATION> to protest special privileges for top party and government figures. ADN announced a criminal investigation into alleged abuse of power by <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, former Premier <PERSON> Willi </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoph </PERSON>, and former Politburo member <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleiber </PERSON>, who are all in seclusion. Their whereabouts is not known. The news agency said <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, who was dropped from power Oct. 18, was under investigation on suspicion of having misused his office for personal gain. It gave no details of the alleged abuses. <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>, a former protege of <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s, has been pressing for exposure and punishment of past errors and excesses as a means of repairing his party's tarnished image. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> faces widespread opposition from many pro-democracy activists, as well as within the troubled party hierarchy that meets in a crucial session Dec. 15-17. The party that has dominated government and society for 40 years also is wrestling with challenges and demands for broader power-sharing by the fledgling political opposition. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> last week announced an internal investigation of reported wrongdoing by <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, his top lieutenant <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mittag </PERSON> and other party figures recently removed from positions of authority. <PERSON> Mittag </PERSON> was thrown out of the party Nov. 23 in the first punitive action against any of the ousted officials. The aging party figures who were part of the hard-line regime headed by <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> for 18 years are accused by pro-democracy forces of having lined their pockets at public expense while the national economy slipped continuously behind that of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Regional government chief <PERSON> Hartmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Boecker </PERSON> said the immunity <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> was earlier entitled to was suspended `` to facilitate a criminal investigation and inquiry,'' ADN reported. Local authorities also have imposed a security cordon around the residential estate to `` prevent the removal of material from the buildings,'' <PERSON> Boecker </PERSON> was quoted by ADN as saying. The move appeared to be aimed at both preserving evidence that might be used against the former leaders in a criminal trial and preventing the residents from absconding with valuables from the state compound. East German newspapers reported Wednesday that <PERSON> Stoph </PERSON> had abandoned his opulent home in a former nature preserve after hauling out artwork and furniture. He left behind expensive electronics, imported wine and other evidence of the lavish lifestyle previously enjoyed by the party elite. ADN gave no indication of what charges might be filed against any of the officials. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, 77, has not been seen in public since his ouster six weeks ago, and is reported to be seriously ill. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> initially was seen as the former leadership's hand-picked successor, and therefore widely mistrusted But under public pressure for social and economic reforms, the new party leadership has agreed to talks on the nation's future, beginning next week. Party leaders have also promised to give up their constitutional mandate for a `` leading role,'' and have agreed to work toward free elections. Also Thursday, the government's chief spokesman declared national unity in the effort to resist moves toward reunification of the two German states. <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> told reporters at a press conference that the appeal issued by leading intellectuals and signed by <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, Premier <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> and other top officials has won `` the support of the majority of the population,'' including the various pro-reform movements pushing the Communists to share power. The appeal was announced after West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> laid out a 10-point plan to work for eventual reunification of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> _ a concept broadly resisted by East Germans who want to remain a separate and sovereign state. A signature drive has been launched for support of the appeal, which declares <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> a socialist state independent of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, preparing to leave for his weekend summit with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, said today he hoped their talks would mark an important milestone toward molding a `` <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that is indeed whole and free.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, meanwhile, called for a 35-nation summit meeting next year to speed up the integration of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and to eliminate East-West divisions. In a speech from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s city hall, where a treaty was signed in 1957 establishing the European Common Market, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said a multinational meeting scheduled for 1992 under the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Accords on human rights and security in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> should be moved up. Earlier, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> joined his Italian hosts in issuing a statement citing the `` changes toward democracy'' in countries such as <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. The statement reiterated the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s willingness to let those <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> bloc nations set their own courses. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he thought he and his summit partner had similar goals. `` Ours is a powerful and historic opportunity,'' he declared in a speech to members of his staff gathered in the windswept Rose Garden outside the White House. As <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> prepared to travel to the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, the nearly 600-member crew of the guided missile carrier USS <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON> worked feverishly around visiting reporters and a tour of Soviet sailors and officers to spruce up the ship and prepare its rooms for the heads of state. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who planned an early evening departure aboard Air Force One, stressed his support for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program of reform, even as he hailed the changes sweeping Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` America understands the magnitude of Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s challenges and let there be no misunderstanding, we support perestroika,'' he said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added that he thought the people of all of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> understand that `` East and West are not in some kind of competition, rather we're both working to make the world a more peaceful one.'' He added, `` Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and I see eye to eye on what our upcoming meeting is all about.'' The Soviet-Italian statement declared that the `` curtain of mistrust between the East and West is crumbling.'' It was issued in conjunction with the signing of accords by foreign ministers <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Gianni </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, pledging cooperation in converting military plants to civilian use, combating drug trafficking, protecting business investments and saving the environment. The statement said both countries hoped talks in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> on reducing conventional weapons would lead to an agreement by the end of next year. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> can `` move beyond containment ... toward a <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that is indeed whole and free,'' and one that has a level of `` security, prosperity and peace as yet unknown in our lifetime.'' In recent weeks, Cold War barriers to freedom have fallen across <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> _ including the beginning of the dismantling of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall _ with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s encouragement. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s sendoff ceremony was attended by nearly 300 administration officials who filled the Rose Garden under blue skies and brisk winds. As he left after the six-minute speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters: `` I'm ready for the meeting. I'm ready and confident.'' Earlier, at a Cabinet meeting called to preview the session, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was confident `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is looking at the meeting very much the same way we are.'' He also said he received a full report Wednesday night from <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> on his own meetings in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last week with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> told reporters <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is n't looking for `` miracles'' from <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> but deserves help from the West such as observer status at world trade talks. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in an interview Wednesday with newspaper correspondents that was released today by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, was asked what changes he foresaw for the rival <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact military alliances. `` It's too early to predict how all this will play out, but clearly it's moving in the right direction and, clearly, it's moving in a way that should result in a permanent reduction of the tensions that have been the hallmark of the Cold War days,'' the president said He said the unfolding changes in the once hard-line communist states in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> have given `` more of an urgency'' to the meeting since he first proposed it in July. But he insisted, `` There's been no change, in my view, as to what this meeting is to be about.'' Asked if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had sent <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> the message that it wants no surprises at <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` We've sent the message that we do n't think there are going to be any. But if he comes with something, fine. I mean, this is an open thing. He can say anything he wants. But I think he wants to see a successful meeting.'' He said he believes the Soviets are not `` looking for confrontation. ... I think that it is unlikely there will be something so dramatic that it puts us in an embarrassing position.'' Harnessing nuclear and conventional weapons also is on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s agenda And while Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> says the sessions aboard <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet warships Saturday and Sunday will not amount to `` an arms control summit,'' two sets of negotiations could get a shot in the arm.

 The personal pilot of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s alleged cocaine godfather was extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Thursday to face prosecution in a massive cocaine importation case, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. He is the ninth person to be extradited from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> since August when the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government began a new drive against drug trafficking, said <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, director of the service. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> identified <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuesta </PERSON> as a kingpin of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, but he is not one of those on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s list of the 12 most wanted drug suspects in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, as many as 300 Colombians already are under indictment in various <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities on drug-related charges, although many of the indictments are sealed. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuesta </PERSON>, indicted with four other <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> leaders last February, was brought to <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, by a team of the marshals special operations group after being turned over by Colombian authorities, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. He faces arraignment in U.S. District Court there. At the time of his arrest last month, de la Cuesta was identified as the pilot of <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, leader of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel. De la Cuesta and the others were charged in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> last Feb. 24 with taking part in a conspiracy that resulted in more than 16 tons of cocaine being smuggled into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The indictment accuses de la Cuesta of piloting or being aboard aircraft that carried more than 9,500 pounds of cocaine from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, the marshals service said. From there, according to the indictment, the cocaine was smuggled into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by plane and boat. Others named in the indictment were <PERSON> Carols </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, tried, convicted and now serving a sentence of life-without-parole and 135 years; <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar-Gaviria </PERSON>; <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez-Gacha </PERSON>; <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa-Vasquez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fabio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa-Vasquez </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Opposition politicians said Thursday they had cleared the way for one of their leaders to become <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s next prime minister The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> members were scheduled to meet Friday to officially elect <PERSON> Vishwanath </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratap </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> head of the five-party <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> coalition. He then likely would be asked by the president to serve as prime minister. <PERSON> Guruswamy </PERSON> said another contender for the job, <PERSON> Chandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shekhar </PERSON>, had been persuaded to withdraw his candidacy, and that no one in the alliance would contest <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s nomination. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, 58, could not be reached for comment Thursday, but he has insisted he does not want to replace Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s colleagues said he had no choice, however. `` He has to bow to the wishes of the people and the party. He has no alternative,'' said <PERSON> Mohan </PERSON> <PERSON> Guruswamy </PERSON>, an associate. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> resigned Wednesday after his <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> failed to win a majority in last week's parliamentary elections, but President <PERSON> Ramaswamy </PERSON> <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON> asked him to continue until a new government is formed. With results for all but two of the 525 Parliament seats announced by Thursday night, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had won the most seats at 192. Its small-party allies together won another 17. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> has 143 seats and has been promised support by the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Bharatiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has 90 seats, and by several left-wing groups, which won 51. That would give the centrist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> 284 seats, more than the 263 needed for a majority. The rest of the seats went to small parties and independents who have not taken sides. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a former defense and finance minister, is the best-known leader in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. But the mild-mannered politician has said he just wants to be president of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the largest component of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. `` Singh is not sure he will be able to handle a hung house,'' a senior leader of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> said speaking on condition of anonymity. `` That's why he was so hesitant to become the prime minister.'' Another source in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> said: `` <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was told he has no business to be in politics if he does not seek office.'' In past elections, one party _ almost always the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ has won a comfortable majority. In the absence of a majority, the president chooses which party will form a government. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said on Wednesday that it would not seek the job. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> has been dogged by highly publicized internal feuds since it was formed in August 1988. After elections were called in October, the front's leaders set aside their differences and united to oust <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. But those differences started to surface this week and a leading newspaper said Thursday they threaten the Front's chances for success. `` The onus of bringing about a realignment of centrist forces, once the government formed by the opposition has had the time to display its ineffectiveness, is squarely with Mr. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>,'' the independent <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Whooping Cranes Make Remarkable Comeback Following Losses in 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKPORT, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The endangered whooping crane population, which suffered devastating losses in 1988, made a remarkable comeback this year, a wildlife refuge manager says. A total of 144 birds have been sighted at the <ORGANIZATION> Aransas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Rockport </LOCATION>, where they spend the winter before returning to their nesting grounds in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Giezentanner </PERSON>, refuge manager. `` We're really happy. As a matter of fact, we're ecstatic so far,'' he said Wednesday. Only 138 whooping cranes out of an expected 150 made it to the refuge last year. Biologists estimated that as many as a dozen birds may have died after leaving their Canadian habitat. One bird was shot by a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> lawyer, who paid a $ 15,000 fine, <PERSON> Giezentanner </PERSON> said. A good sign this year is that of the 21 whooping crane chicks sighted and tagged in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, all but one made it to the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> refuge. The increase in the world's only remaining naturally reproducing flock of whooping cranes is the result of favorable nesting conditions in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the fact that many of the birds are reaching breeding age, <PERSON> Giezentanner </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Cheating Probe Leads To Dismissal of Military Police Academy Students</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A cheating investigation at the military <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Lackland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> has led to the dismissal of 14 students and charges against one of them and an instructor, authorities said. `` This was the first time there was a suspected compromise -LRB- of tests -RRB- of this magnitude,'' said base spokeswoman <PERSON> Delores </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>. One-third of a law enforcement class at the school, which trains police for all military branches, was dismissed as a result of the investigation, the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antonio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The investigation started in September when officials looked into allegations that a Marine instructor had sexual relations with a female <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> student, who in turn allegedly received test answers from the instructor. The female student allegedly gave the answers to four <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> colleagues at the academy, authorities said. Those four <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> students were dismissed from the academy, although not from the military. The woman student also was dismissed from the school, and she and the Marine instructor face courts-martial, the Light reported. Ms. <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> said Thursday that she did n't know the exact charges that are being brought. While investigating that case, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials uncovered information about a separate and larger cheating ring. `` The two -LRB- investigations -RRB- are unrelated, other than one investigation led to another,'' <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> said. The instructor probe led investigators to information that nine other students at the security school had been using workbooks prepared by upper-classmen as they prepared for their exams. Ms. <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> said that the practice was not technically cheating, but is considered unethical, and the students were dismissed from the school. They, too, will be retrained for other positions in the military, she said. The names of those involved were not immediately released. This is the largest cheating case uncovered at the police academy, although authorities have investigated smaller, isolated cases of cheating in the past, they said.

<HEAD>Housing Authority Instituting Midnight Basketball for Gang Kids</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The city's public housing agency wants to defuse late-night tension in some tough neighborhoods by luring gang members into a midnight basketball league. `` This is for kids who have been written off,'' said <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> authority staff member and commissioner of the new league. From 10 p.m. until 2 a.m. beginning in January, 150 young men from 18 to 25 years old will be shooting at baskets. The idea is to keep the young men, especially the gang leaders, off the streets during a dangerous time and give them extra support and leadership in an effort to steer them straight, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` This is going to be modeled after the <ORGANIZATION> NBA </ORGANIZATION> _ uniforms, playoffs and championships,'' said <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. `` But also, just like in the <ORGANIZATION> NBA </ORGANIZATION>, if somebody has a drug problem, we're going to provide counseling. Family problems, money problems, education, job training _ we're going to help. The program also was modeled on one in <LOCATION> Glenarden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, just outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> D.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, a former semiprofessional basketball player, said he's not alarmed by the prospect of rival gang members crowding into a gym to watch or play `` One thing I've found is that sports transcends gang feuding,'' he said. `` I've seen them lay their pistols down, play basketball, then pick up their pistols and leave.'' The authority has come up with $ 50,000, half from the federal government, for start-up money and will seek corporate sponsors. `` We want to take them away to a resort for three days of orientation to tell them exactly what we're about,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. `` And it's not about winning and losing basketball games, but about building self-esteem and personal pride,'' he said. <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Peoples, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gardens </ORGANIZATION> housing project, said she expects the program to be popular. The image of gang members standing around on the street corner uninterested in anything but trouble, is n't accurate, Ms. Peoples said. `` Some of the kids in gangs have come to us looking for employment,'' she said. `` The stereotype is n't totally true.''

<HEAD>NBC News Anchor John Palmer Leaving After 26 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former `` Today'' show news anchorman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said Thursday he's leaving <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in January to work on a new syndicated daily half-hour series, `` Only Yesterday,'' that he will anchor. `` I've been with NBC News for 26 years, and it's a little scary to leave the mother ship,'' he said in an interview. `` But it presented the kind of challenge that I think we need to do to kind of shake up our lives a little bit.'' `` I'm sorry he chose not to stay here,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gartner </PERSON> said in a statement. `` I wish him the best. He is a professional newsman and an extremely nice human being.'' There has been speculation that <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> would leave <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> since September when, as part of a shakeup at `` Today,'' he was replaced by <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Norville </PERSON> as the show's news anchor. He was shifted to her former anchor job at the earlier `` NBC News at Sunrise.'' <PERSON> Norville </PERSON> now is scheduled to become `` Today'' co-host in January when <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON> leaves the show after 13 years. No decision has been made yet on who will suceed <PERSON> Norville </PERSON> as `` Today'' news anchor. <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, 54, had been been negotiating to work both as an anchorman at station <ORGANIZATION> WTVJ-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, an NBC-owned station, and as a Miami-based Latin American correspondent for NBC News. But about 10 days ago, he said, he got a call from former <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> executive Av Westin, creator of the New York-based newsmagazine series he will now anchor. <PERSON> Westin </PERSON> now is senior vice president of reality-based programming for King World Productions. <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Westin </PERSON> as saying, `` This is a wrist-grabbing call. ... Do n't sign anything, I want to talk to you.'' Their talks led to his decision to leave <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> for `` Only Yesterday,'' which he said still is under development. The series will look at both recent news developments and moments in contemporary history and try to put them into perspective, he said. King World, which will produce and sell the series, syndicates the successful `` Wheel of Fortune'' and `` Jeopardy'' game shows and the <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON> talk show. No decision has been made on <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>'s successor at `` NBC News at Sunrise,'' an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said.

<HEAD>Law Experts Mixed on Usefulness of Sedition Tactic After Mistrial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal jury's rejection of seditious conspiracy charges against three radicals may signal that the little-used prosecution tactic will remain that way, a constitutional scholar said. Others cautioned that the loss may be a setback, but wo n't stop future sedition prosecutions. The nearly yearlong trial of <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Levasseur </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> ended in a mistrial Wednesday after the jury deadlocked on whether the three's alleged bombing exploits constituted racketeering. Prosecutors said they may decide Friday whether to retry the unresolved charges. On Monday, the jury issued a partial verdict clearing the three on the sedition charges that they plotted to overthrow the government. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinoy </PERSON>, a constitutional law expert at <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, interpreted that as a serious blow to the prosecution tactic of filing seditious conspiracy charges. `` I think there were defense lawyers definitely watching who will use -LRB- the <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> case -RRB- as a very strong indication that the seditious conspiracy technique has got to be totally abandoned,'' <PERSON> Kinoy </PERSON> said. `` I think the jury was reacting in a very fundamental and positive way to the basic constitutional protections of the people of this country in the exercise of their First Amendment rights.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON>, a defense lawyer who has been active in supporting radical causes, called the jury's decision `` a big setback'' for prosecutors, adding that it was `` a deserved one because what they've been doing for a long time is prosecuting revolutionary people in a far different way than anybody else, than murderers, thieves and so on.'' Prosecutors had claimed that the defendants belonged to a band of terrorists who conspired to commit bombings and bank robberies along the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> from 1976 to 1984 in a plot to overthrow the government. The seditious conspiracy charges trace their roots to the prosecution of Confederate spies in the Civil War era. The Sedition Act of 1918 was used against war protesters in World War I and to prosecute Puerto Rican nationalists in 1950. In April 1988, nine white supremacists were acquitted of seditious conspiracy in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. Prosecutors would n't comment on how they interpreted the <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> verdict. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Fink </PERSON>, a member of the defense team, said, `` I think they're going to give it up for a while. I think we dealt them a stunning and complete defeat.'' Still, <PERSON> Fink </PERSON> and retired <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> Professor <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinn </PERSON>, an expert on revolutionary history, said they do n't expect the government to abandon seditious conspiracy. `` I'm not saying they'll use it tomorrow. But they're there as handy weapons for them to use whenever they want to repress,'' <PERSON> Zinn </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Budd </PERSON> was deciding Thursday whether to try again on the unresolved racketeering charges. A statement may be made Friday, spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Spurlock </PERSON> said. A hearing is scheduled Jan. 5 in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to formally decide the disposition of the case. Jurors had also cleared Mrs. <PERSON> Levasseur </PERSON> of a charge of racketeering. They deadlocked on two counts of racketeering against the two men and counts of racketeering conspiracy against all three. Each count carries a maximum penalty of 20 years and $ 20,000 in fines. While admitting nothing, the defense had said that prosecution was pointless since <PERSON> Levasseur </PERSON> and <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> were already serving lengthy sentences for convictions on some of the bombings. Mrs. <PERSON> Levasseur </PERSON> was free on bail after serving 3 -LCB- years of a 5-year sentence for harboring a fugitive, her husband. The indictments were issued in May 1986 and the three defendants were all that remained of an original group of eight. Jury selection began in March 1988 and the actual trial began in January. Estimates of the cost ranged from $ 2 million to $ 10 million.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> has gained notoriety as one of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s deadliest leftist terrorist groups in two decades of bloody attacks on West German and American targets. Prosecutors said the group claimed responsibility for the bomb attack Thursday morning that killed <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> _ <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s largest _ and one of Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s closest economic advisers. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION>, which had been relatively inactive the past three years, began operating in the late 1960s. It was known then as the Baader-Meinhof gang, named after its founders <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Baader </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ulrike </PERSON> <PERSON> Meinhof </PERSON>. It gained a reputation as a brutal, well-organized group that struck at the heart of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s industrial and economic power by targeting leading managers for assassinations. American military targets have also come under <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> attacks in the group's `` anti-imperialist struggle.'' Most of the original <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> leaders have been killed by police or have died in prison. Authorities say the group is now believed to consist of a core of 20 to 30 members. The group's first action came in April 1968 with arson attacks on two <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> department stores. The group changed its name to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> in 1971 and a series of assassinations and bomb attacks followed. On May 11, 1972, five bombs exploded at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s 5th Corps headquarters in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, killing an American officer and injuring 13 other people. On May 25, 1972, three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers were killed and five injured when a powerful bomb left in a parked car ripped through a parking lot at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s European headquarters in <LOCATION> Heidelberg </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility. In April 1975, <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> terrorists occupied the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> in an attempt to free imprisoned fellow terrorists. Two diplomats and two terrorists died in an explosion during the siege. The year 1977 is remembered as a particularly bloody period, when <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> attacks shook the foundations of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s society. That year, the group assassinated chief state prosecutor <PERSON> Siegfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Buback </PERSON>; kidnapped and killed the head of the employer's association, <PERSON> Hanns-Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Schleyer </PERSON>; and killed <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponto </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Dresdner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, one of the county's three big banks A <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> jet was also hijacked to <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> in an attempt to force authorities to free jailed <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> leaders. A West German commando team stormed the jetliner to end the siege. A few hours later, <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> leaders <PERSON> Baader </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jan-Carle </PERSON> <PERSON> Raspe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gudrun </PERSON> <PERSON> Ensslin </PERSON> committed suicide in <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION>'s top-security prison of <LOCATION> Stammheim </LOCATION>, where they were serving life sentences <PERSON> Meinhof </PERSON> had committed suicide in prison a year earlier. Even with the deaths of the group's most notorious leaders, the attacks did not cease. In August 1981, 20 people were injured in a car-bomb attack on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION>. Two weeks later, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Gen. <PERSON> Frederik </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroesen </PERSON>, commander of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION>, narrowly escaped assassination in <LOCATION> Heidelberg </LOCATION> when his car was attacked by rockets. On Feb. 1, 1985, <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> industrialist <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> was shot and killed at his home by two terrorists. On Aug. 8, 1985, a car bomb killed two <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> personnel at the Rhein-Main Air Base outside <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and injured 20 others. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldier had been killed a day earlier in <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for both attacks. In July 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> terrorists killed industrialist <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckurts </PERSON> near <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, and in October that year, diplomat <PERSON> Gerold </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Braunmuehl </PERSON> was shot and killed on a street in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. Authorities say about 60 people, including terrorists, have been killed since the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> began its terrorist campaign.

<TEXT>
 Round, black markers dotted the huge stone faces of four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidents Thursday as a project got under way to develop a long-term maintenance plan for <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rushmore </LOCATION>. Six <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> employees and workers from an engineering firm carefully positioned 60 to 75 of the plastic markers on the 60-foot granite faces so a photographer in a helicopter could take close-up pictures Friday of the hundreds of cracks that may threaten the structural integrity of the Shrine of Democracy. `` The ultimate purpose is so we can actually map those cracks and make models of the mountain and then analyze those models to determine what potential movement and instability is there,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wenk </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rushmore </LOCATION> superintendent. The black markers, 15 inches across or a little bigger than a record album, will become reference marks in the photographs. The markers should be removed Friday afternoon, <PERSON> Wenk </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Crisman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, who was suspended by a cable in front of the faces, stuck the markers on with an adhesive. A ground crew of surveyors was in radio contact from the <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rushmore </LOCATION> Visitors Center telling him where to place the markers. Each fall, workers seal cracks in the faces with a mixture of granite dust, white lead and linseed oil to keep out water that would freeze and to lessen the damage when cool weather makes the rock contract. It was decided two years ago that a comprehensive examination of the popular tourist attraction and a maintenance plan was needed, <PERSON> Wenk </PERSON> said. Monthly measurements since 1980 of a prominent crack on the forehead of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>'s likeness indicated the potential instability of the fissure, he said. A scientist projected that the crack would widen one-quarter of an inch every 200 years, <PERSON> Wenk </PERSON> said. `` There has been no discernable damage to the memorial to date, and this will allow us to make certain we can preserve it,'' he said. <PERSON> Wenk </PERSON> said the project actually started in September when aerial photographs were taken. `` Something that's carved in stone has the impression of lasting forever,'' he said. `` It's been 62 years since the carving first began. It's a blink of an eye in geologic time. `` What we know for sure right now is that the mountain is still in the same shape it was when it was completed.'' A structural analysis of the portraits of Presidents <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> drilled and blasted into a mountainside in the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> should be done by next fall, <PERSON> Wenk </PERSON> said. They are largest carved figures anywhere. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s face is as high as a five-story building, bigger than any sphinx in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, and the monument can be seen for 60 miles. <PERSON> Wenk </PERSON> said the estimated $ 350,000 cost of the project will be paid by the private <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rushmore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. The non-profit group has served as a benefactor to the monument since 1930. Work on <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rushmore </LOCATION> began in 1927 by sculptor <PERSON> Gutzon </PERSON> <PERSON> Borglum </PERSON> and was finished in 1941 by his son, <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>. The Black Hills memorial attracts about 2 million visitors a year. The monument was the scene of a climactic final battle in `` North By <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON>'s classic 1959 thriller starring <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>. A golden anniversary celebration is being planned for 1991. <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rushmore </LOCATION> never has been officially dedicated, and <PERSON> Wenk </PERSON> said it is hoped President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will agree to do the honors for the 50th anniversary.

 A fire that damaged the home of a state legislator and leading opponent of a university play about AIDS and homosexuality was accidental, investigators said Thursday. Fireplace embers dumped in the back yard Wednesday night by one of Rep. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s children ignited leaves and scrap wood and spread to the home, causing an estimated $ 5,000 to $ 10,000 damage, Chief Fire Marshal <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bittle </PERSON> said.

She objected to the use of a public facility for a play that presents homosexuality as an acceptable lifestyle. On Nov. 15, a fire destroyed the home of a student who led a campaign in support of the play. Investigators blamed arson, but no arrests have been made. Supporters of the play, which sold out quickly amid the controversy, had accused Mrs. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> of censorship and said the production helped educate students about AIDS.

<TEXT>
 A hazing incident has led to the banishment of a <ORGANIZATION> Stetson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> fraternity that got into trouble over rape allegations against several members last year. The Baptist-affiliated school announced Wednesday that it had withdrawn recognition of Pi <PERSON> Kappa </PERSON> <PERSON> Alpha </PERSON> as a result of an investigation that found members had degraded pledges, conducted a public stunt and inflicted mental abuse. A Nov. 9 incident involving frat members, known as `` Pikes,'' in the <ORGANIZATION> Ocala </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> reflected poorly on the campus' fraternith and sorority system, the university said in a statement It did not give details of the hazing. As a result of <PERSON> Stetson </PERSON>'s action, <LOCATION> Pi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kappa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alpha </LOCATION>'s national office suspended the fraternity's charter, and the organization's executive director said he will try to have the chapter kicked out A fraternity member, the Stetson chapter, the national organization and the university have been sued by a woman who told investigators she was raped during a night of heavy drinking and dancing at the Pike house in April 1988. The state attorney's office investigated the rape complaint against two fraternity brothers. It found that they did have sexual contact with the woman but said rape could not be proved. The woman's attorney, <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, said additional fraternity members would be added to the lawsuit before it goes to trial. Four Pikes were suspended for one semester as a result of that incident, and the fraternity was prohibited from participating in social activities or sporting events. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kappa </PERSON> <PERSON> Alpha </PERSON>'s national executive director, said the Stetson chapter had been one category below a fully accredited chapter since last spring.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government said Thursday it will tear down the fences on its border with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and lift virtually all restrictions on travel to the West. The Communist Party held its first talks with the opposition, and members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> proposed the repeal of tough laws used to imprison and fine dissenters. The party also said it would announce a new program to include `` an objective revision'' of its attitude toward the `` Prague Spring'' reform movement of 1968 and the Soviet-led invasion that crushed it. Spokesman <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Hora </PERSON> said the new policies might allow for readmission to the party of half a million people expelled after the invasion. They include <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, who was <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief and led the reforms. <PERSON> Hora </PERSON> said two Politburo members met for the first time with the opposition Civic Forum group and students, who led 11 days of mass protest that toppled the old party leadership. He said the meeting occurred because `` we are just one of the political parties in this country, and we have to find our place.'' Civic Forum previously had met only with Premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> and other government officials. State radio began broadcasting twice-daily programs about Civic Forum activities, and also featured music by singers who had been banned for years. Government spokesman <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jansen </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> would begin the `` removal of technical equipment'' on the frontier with neutral <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, which bristles with barbed wire, watchtowers and trip wires. He did not say whether similar action would be taken on the long, fortified border with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> started tearing down its border barriers with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> in May, and tens of thousands of East Germans fled across the frontier to the West before the East German government abolished travel restrictions. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said that starting Monday, citizens will be allowed to use their passports for unrestricted travel to the West and all East bloc countries except the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> reported. The only remaining formality will be completion of a simple `` statistical card,'' to be filled out as people leave the country, <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> said. The government had announced Nov. 14 that its citizens would be able to go to the West and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, a popular vacation spot, beginning Jan. 1 without waiting 30 days for an exit visa. <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> said six political prisoners were released and that President <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> granted amnesty to <PERSON> Stanislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Devaty </PERSON>, a former spokesman for the Charter 77 human rights group who went underground weeks ago, and another activist. State radio said Marxism-Leninism was being abolished as a compulsory subject at universities, meeting a demand from students, and faculty members would be hired on the basis of professional qualifications rather than <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> membership. Economist <PERSON> Valtr </PERSON> <PERSON> Komarek </PERSON>, a reform-minded Communist some opposition leaders see as a possible premier, cautioned against too much compromise in negotiations for reform with <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>. He spoke one day after <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> removed provisions from the constitution that guarantee the Communists a monopoly on power. Whatever the change in its constitutional status, the party has 1.7 million members and controls the official media, police, armed forces and appointments in every operation from factories to village schools. `` The structure of power remains intact,'' <PERSON> Komarek </PERSON> said. `` It is only the facade which has collapsed, and the structure of power has receded into the background.'' `` Too many compromises are made, too much is spoken, too little is done. Relapses are still possible.'' The order to remove the fences reflected the new foreign policy <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> said he seeks to implement. He has said he will choose a new government by Sunday that includes non-Communists. Members of Civic Forum could be among them. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> said Thursday he would accept opposition suggestions on who should serve in the new government. Civic Forum spokesman <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dienstbier </PERSON> said Wednesday night the opposition wanted a civilian Communist to run the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and a non-Communist to oversee police forces at the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. In a television address Wednesday night, <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> appeared to promote himself as a figure of consensus to <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s 15.5 million citizens. He called for a reassessment of the 1968 <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion, and pledged to negotiate withdrawal of the 80,000 Soviet soldiers stationed in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> ever since. The Soviet forces were seen as legitimizing party chief <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> and other Czechoslovak leaders installed by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> after the August invasion, but those men now have been ousted. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> said a Soviet withdrawal could occur only in `` an all-European framework.'' <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> said members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> had suggested repeal of the `` public order'' laws used to impose stiff fines or jail terms on anti-government protesters. The agency said the deputies, whom it did not identify, planned to submit that proposal and other legal measures to shorten pre-trial custody to a maximum of two months and remove the offense of `` abusing a religious function,' which has been used against priests. Priests must be licensed in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, and many have had to go underground after being barred from office by authorities. Deputies also want the independence of courts spelled out in a new consitution and seek laws to punish those who damage the environment, <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> reported. Nearly one-third of the nation's forests have been destroyed by acid rain and other pollution, and both air and water are badly polluted in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and several other cities.

 A chartered jet carrying 130 Vietnamese who volunteered to return to the Communist homeland they fled flew for <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> on Thursday amid signs that many more boat people may soon be repatriated against their will. The sixth and largest batch of Vietnamese to voluntarily return home included nine babies who were born in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>.

The voluntary repatriation program, which is sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refugees </ORGANIZATION>, has only attracted a small fraction of the nearly 57,000 Vietnamese languishing in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, where they are seeking asylum after fleeing their homeland by boat. About 44,000 of the Vietnamese arrived after June 1988, when <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> adopted a policy that treats all arriving boat people as illegal immigrants subject to repatriation unless they can prove they fled political or religious persecution.

<TEXT>
 A businessman whose financial relationship with former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was investigated by a congressional ethics committee has filed for protection under federal bankruptcy law. <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> listed debts of $ 12.2 million and assets of $ 533,626 in the petition filed Wednesday in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Court. <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON>, filed under Chapter 7 provisions of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Code, which allow a debtor's unprotected assets to be liquidated to pay creditors. <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>'s $ 500,000 home and $ 30,000 worth of personal possessions are exempt from seizure, said <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. With those exemptions, the 177 creditors listed in the bankruptcy filing are likely to receive `` virtually nothing,'' <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star-Telegram </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>, 55, said the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oil and real estate busts took his fortune, just like those of the <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> brothers and former Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Connally </PERSON>. `` My economic fate was set, as was everybody else's, when oil prices went to $ 10 in 1986. We all got caught,'' he said. <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> estimated his net worth peaked at $ 7 million in 1982. Although he has focused on real estate, he also once had oil holdings worth about $ 1.5 million. More than 80 percent of <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>'s debt is in three large loans for real estate developments, including $ 6.2 million owed to <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> for financing on a $ 10 million office tower in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> is one of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s closest friends. The longtime congressman from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> resigned in June after a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee said he committed 69 ethics violations, most involving business and book deals. Among other issues, the committee questioned <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s business dealings with <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> in a partnership called Mallightco. The committee said there was `` reason to believe'' that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had improperly accepted nearly $ 145,000 in gifts from <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> and failed to report them. Most of the money came from an $ 18,000 annual salary to the speaker's wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, over four years. It also included use of a car, a condominium and an apartment. At the time, <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> denied the partnership was a device to funnel money to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and said Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had earned her pay. This week, <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> said his Chapter 7 filing does not involve <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> or Mallightco, which is now controlled by one of <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>'s daughters.

 A bipartisan group of 203 members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday expressed concern to Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> over reports of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for a <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> role in a transitional government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. In a letter signed by 177 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members and 26 senators, timed to coincide with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s depature for the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> summit with Soviet President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the lawmakers said they would `` welcome some clarification'' about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The civil war there is one of several regional conflicts to be addressed at the summit. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, blamed for the deaths of more than a million Cambodians during its rule of the country in the 1970s, is the strongest of the factions engaged in a civil war against the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government.

 The first nationwide scientific survey for hepatitis B infection shows the infectious liver disease is four times as common among blacks as whites, the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. In a survey of more than 14,000 people over five years, 4.8 percent showed signs in blood tests of having been infected with hepatitis B virus some time during their lives. Among blacks, 13.7 percent tested positive, compared with 3.2 percent among whites. Previous studies, including checks of blood samples given by blood donors, have pointed to an increased hepatitis B rate among blacks. But this study is the first among a statistically representative sample of people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said Dr. <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Alter </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> hepatitis specialist. The survey was conducted in the years 1976-1980 by the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>, but the results were reported Thursday for the first time The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> gave no explanation for the delay. Blacks' increased likelihood of getting hepatitis B sometime during their lives was especially evident in test results for people 65-74. In that age group, 39.6 percent of blacks had had hepatitis B infections, compared with 6.9 percent of whites. Hepatitis B is transmitted in ways somewhat similar to AIDS _ through sexual intercourse or direct contact with blood. Infections can cause inflammation of the liver, jaundice and flu-like symptoms. The disease can be prevented by a vaccine developed in 1982. Researchers believe as many as half the people infected with hepatitis B never suffer severe symptoms and never know they are infected. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> did not speculate on reasons for the increased prevalence of hepatitis B among blacks, but the Atlanta-based agency did say that the traditional targets for hepatitis B vaccinations _ health workers who handle blood, dialysis patients and some institutionalized people _ may be the wrong targets. Given the high prevalence of hepatitis B infections among blacks and a trend toward infection during adolescence, `` immunization of the traditionally targeted risk groups will not markedly affect the spread of infection in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Immunization programs need to include adolescents and young adults,'' the agency said. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> noted that survey findings showing higher rates of active infection for people in the 12-24 age group, compared with children under 11. Twenty thousand hepatitis B cases have been reported in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this year; many cases go unreported.

<TEXT>
 The premier of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> on Thursday challenged the need for a <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> state to exist at all following a decision by <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s largest republic, to sever ties with his northern state. `` The latest events give rise to the question of the sense of our further joint existence,'' <PERSON> Dusan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinigoj </PERSON> said in a statement carried by the official <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency. `` Without ... democracy, human rights and -LRB- <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s -RRB- inclusion in the integrative processes in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, we can not develop into a democratic and efficient community of nationalities.'' Communist <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is a loose federation of six republics and two autonomous provinces, with many nationalities and differing ethnic populations. The regions have grown increasingly restive since the death in 1980 of <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>, founder of the modern <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> state in 1945. <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>'s charisma was credited as a major force in binding <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> together and submerging the regional tensions that surfaced after his death. Liberal and prosperous <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, where multiparty democracy is being established, and the <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> leadership, which advocates continued <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rule and a strongly centralized federal system, have a history of disputes. Yugoslav politicians and news media were deeply divided over <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s decision, announced Wednesday, to break off all government and business contacts with <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>. Some Western diplomats described <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s move as a possible first step toward disintegration of the fractious Yugoslav federation. <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> acted after <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> banned a mass protest rally by Serb nationalists in <LOCATION> Ljubljana </LOCATION>, the Slovene capital. The demonstration, orchestrated by the Serbian government, was scheduled for Friday in an apparent attempt by <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s conservative Communist politicians to topple <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>'s reformist leadership <PERSON> Sinigoj </PERSON> said that `` threats of destructive marches, the fanning of nationalist passions and demands for replacement of legally elected -LRB- officials -RRB- can not achieve'' the democratization of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. `` The instigators of such actions must be stopped.'' <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s break in relations appears to be the culmination of a long campaign against <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> and of its repeated informal attempts to achieve an economic boycott on that republic. Slovenian politicians believe <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> leaders want to impose their ideological orthodoxy on all of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. Serbs from southern <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> province, who were to have spearheaded the rally, denounced the ban as `` fascist-like.'' Serbian officials elsewhere called it `` a brutal ... anti-Serbian and anti-Yugoslav act of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>'s ruling clique.'' But a radio report in <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION>, another northern region that has supported <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>'s reforms, said `` <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> has demonstrated how a state based on the rule of law should function, and therefore it is extremely cynical to accuse it of fascism.'' <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION>'s influential Vjesnik newspaper wrote that <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s `` diabolic plan ... has been thwarted by the decisiveness and firmness of the Slovene leadership, with the support of the vast majority of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s citizens. Police checked vehicles Thursday to stop Serbians from reaching <LOCATION> Ljubljana </LOCATION>. The Slovene capital was virtually deserted. Most residents went to nearby Alpine resorts for a two-day holiday marking the 46th anniversary of the establishment of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> as a Communist state.

<HEAD>Rate Rises One-Fourth Cent Friday for Quake Relief</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Beginning Friday, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> shoppers have to dig one-quarter of one percent deeper into their pocketbooks to help pay for earthquake relief. The quarter-cent-per-dollar sales tax increase was approved in the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s November special session and lasts until Dec. 31, 1990. The extra revenue is expected to total $ 800 million over the next 13 months. The extra tax was timed to take advantage of the two year-end holiday retail sales surges. Most of the money it raises will help pay for rebuilding roads, bridges and public buildings damaged in the earthquake that struck the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> area Oct. 17. For most counties in the state, the new sales and use tax rate will be 6.25 percent. However, voters in 13 counties, including <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, had previously approved half-cent sales tax increases, so their new rate is 6.75 percent. Five counties, including <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, have had two such local increases, so their rate is 7.25 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> agreed to the tax increase in a special session called by Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, rejecting arguments from some legislators that state surplus funds, instead of a tax increase, should go to quake relief and arguments from the other side that the quarter-cent hike was not enough.

<TEXT>
 New President <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> vowed Thursday to recover the presidential palace and other government institutions from a defiant Christian Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, but said he would try to avoid bloodshed. He spoke at a news conference as hundreds of Syrian army trucks carried supplies to frontline positions in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and in mountains east and northeast of the capital. `` The Syrian troops are in combat formations. Their command is supplying them with ammunition enough to last for quite a long time,'' according to a military source in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Preparations for a final showdown to oust <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> from the presidential palace in suburban <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION> have been afoot all week. Syrian troops and armor began rolling in Monday, strengthening forces along the front lines after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> rejected <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>'s election Nov. 24 and subsequent presidential decrees dismissing the general as army commander and disbanding his interim military Cabinet. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has requested military support from the commander of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s surrogate militia in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, Gen. <PERSON> Antoine </PERSON> <PERSON> Lahd </PERSON>, but that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> rejected the appeal. <PERSON> Lahd </PERSON> commands the Israeli-backed, 2,500-man <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> militia, which patrols a buffer zone <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> maintains in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, ostensibly to protect its northern border against guerrilla attacks. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> aides had no immediate comment on the report. `` I will resort to all possible means to regain the state institutions from those who control them,'' <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, said at the news conference in <LOCATION> Ablah </LOCATION>, an army barracks in the Syrian-policed Bekaa valley. <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> moved to an officer's residence at the Ablah barracks Wednesday pending settlement of the dispute over the presidential palace. <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, also a Maronite, of `` partitioning <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' adding that he `` has hope in our armed forces to reunite the nation.'' `` I do n't want bloodshed, either in -LRB- Christian -RRB- east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> or in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. ... I'll use all possible means to reunite the country,'' he said. He urged all 42,000 Lebanese army soldiers to be `` at the disposal of your new commander, Adm. <PERSON> Emile </PERSON> <PERSON> Lahoud </PERSON>,'' who was appointed Tuesday to replace <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> as army commander. About 20,000 soldiers remain loyal to <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, and the others, mainly Moslem units, have accepted <PERSON> Lahoud </PERSON> as commander. Addressing <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and his supporters, <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> said: `` You have killed the president of the republic and attacked the residences and property of parliamentary deputies. These attacks will not go unpunished.'' <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>'s predecessor, President <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> was killed by a bomb in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Nov. 22, 17 days after his election. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and its allies blamed <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> for the killing, but he denied the charge. The homes of at least six Christian parliamentarians were destroyed by bombs in the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> enclave after <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> approved a peace plan to end 14 years of civil war at a special session in the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> resort Taif in October. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> rejected the accord because it did include a timetable for a Syrian troop withdrawal. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has contacted the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> government, key <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> friends, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to express support for <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> and `` our wish that the process of reconciliation continue through peaceful means.'' She also said Thursday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials believe <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> should `` step aside in favor of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s constitutionally sanctioned government.'' <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has 40,000 troops controlling 70 percent of Lebanese territory. They moved in under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate, but later became the Moslems' main backers. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> fought the Syrians for six months this year. An Arab League cease-fire halted hostilities in September. <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s interest would `` best be preserved by implementing the Taif accord,'' which mainly redistributes power equally between Christians and Moslems. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the Christians' main protector, on Thursday ordered the amphibious troop ship, Orace, to sail from <LOCATION> Toulon </LOCATION> toward <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to be ready to evacuate French nationals should the security situation deteriorate. There are 6,000 French nationals in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, many of them Lebanese with dual nationality. Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem, said <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has `` contradicting'' policies toward <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` On the one hand, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> declares support for the legitimate Lebanese authorities, and on the other it does not miss a chance to show its muscles in the face of the legitimate authorities,'' he said. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> had supported <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>'s election and backed the Arab League-brokered Taif accord, but 33 right-wing French parliamentarins visited <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Wednesday and declared support for <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, Cabinet Minister <PERSON> Roni </PERSON> <PERSON> Milo </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was carefully following developments in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> after Syrian troop buildups against <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> the past few days. A Moslem government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: `` The next 48 hours will be decisive. They will determine whether <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> will be dealt with politically or militarily.''

They said it was the first time terrorists used such a detonator in West German. Federal criminal police offered a reward of up to $ 2.2 million, one of the largest here ever. Police with helicopters were searching for two men seen leaving the area. A stolen white <ORGANIZATION> Lancia </ORGANIZATION> believed to have been used in the getaway was found abandoned in a <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> suburb. `` For a long time, the <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON> in particular have been targeted by the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Hans-Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Foerster </PERSON>, spokesman for the chief federal prosecutor's office He said the ultraleftists accuse <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> financing </ORGANIZATION> a worldwide `` military-industrial'' complex. The explosion, heard three miles away, turned <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON>'s armored limousine into a heap of twisted metal and blew out windows in buildings His driver, <PERSON> Jakob </PERSON> <PERSON> Nix </PERSON>, was seriously injured, but police said his condition was not critical. Security agents following in another car were unhurt. A letter found at the scene claimed responsibility on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s deadliest terrorist group, of which little had been heard since 1986. <PERSON> Foerster </PERSON> said the letter `` was not typical'' of <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> claims because it did not explain motives. After previous attacks, the terrorist group left lengthy statements giving detailed reasons for the actions. He said the letter was signed `` Commando <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Beer </PERSON>,'' for a suspect in an investigation of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION>, and carried Faction symbols: a star-shaped symbol and a drawing of a Kalashnikov assault rifle. Interior Minister <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON>, who is in charge of police and security issues, said protection for prominent figures was stepped up after a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> hunger strike that ended last April. During the fast, one imprisoned terrorist called for increasing activities `` with all means.'' <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> that since then, <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> followers are believed operating with more autonomy than before, when they were guided by a tight-knit structure. Chancellor <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, his eyes filled with tears and his voice breaking, condemned the `` cowardly and brutal murder'' of his personal friend. Parliament interrupted debate for five minutes in honor of <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said, `` We deplore this terrorist act ... and stand ready to assist in any way that we can.'' <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON>, the best-known figure in West German business, often advised <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and frequently accompanied him on trips abroad. The tall, striking financier had led <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> on an aggressive expansion aimed at putting it among the world's top 10 or 15 banks. He urged more investment in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other parts of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Most recently, he recommended West German investment in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> owns large interests in many leading West German companies, including <ORGANIZATION> Daimler-Benz </ORGANIZATION>, the largest conglomerate. <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON> arranged the biggest industrial restructuring in West German history, the merger of <ORGANIZATION> Daimler-Benz </ORGANIZATION> with aerospace giant <ORGANIZATION> Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm </ORGANIZATION>. The bank under <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON> had been preparing for a leading role as the Common Market moves toward a barrier-free internal market of 1992. The bank's efforts to gain a stake in investment banking culminated this week in the $ 640 million takeover bid for the British investment bank <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grenfell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. The banker sat on many company boards, and last year became the sole chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which he joined in 1969. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> was born in the 1960s and has a long history of attacks on West German business and political figures, as well as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military targets. Its last known operations were the murders in 1986 of <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckurts </PERSON> of the giant <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> industrial concern and diplomat <PERSON> Gerold </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Braunmuehl </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> faction was believed connected with an unsuccessful attempt on the life of <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Tietmeyer </PERSON> in September 1988. <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Boge </PERSON>, head of the federal criminal investigation's office, said: `` There were never any signs that they had given up, so we were constantly warning against people writing them off too quickly. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> faction is believed to have 20 to 30 hard-core members, aided by dozens of sympathizers. Most of its original leaders have been killed by police, committed suicide in prison or are serving long prison sentences. <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON>'s wife and two daughters survive.

<HEAD>EPA Proposes Tighter Controls on Municipal Incinerators</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> proposed tigher pollution controls Thursday on hundreds of municipal waste incinerators, including a requirement that at least one-fourth of all reusable garbage be recycled. Although the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said the tigher standards would curtail incinerator emissions by 90 percent within five years, the proposal was attacked immediately by environmentalists, who said the agency should require greater recycling. The proposal is the first attempt by the federal government to impose a nationwide standard on toxic chemical releases from garbage incineration plants, although many communities already have curbs, some as stringent as those proposed by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>. There are more than 450 garbage incinerators nationwide with 150 more expected to be built over the next five years as municipalities increasingly turn to burning garbage as landfill space becomes scarce. `` This proposal will assure that municipal waste incinerators employ the best demonstrated technology to protect public health and the environment by reducing air emissions and toxic ash,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, the assistant <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator for air and radiation. <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said a final regulation is expected to be issued within a year. Federal regulations currently place restrictions only on dust emissions from the burning of garbage, although many states and localities have toxic pollution controls as well. The additional pollution control equipment was estimated to amount to an added cost of about $ 20 a year for every household served by a garbage incineration plant, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Many environmentalists have accused the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> of putting too much emphasis on incineration in dealing with the mounting garbage problem and not giving enough attention to recycling. They argue that even with the tighter controls some unhealthy levels of toxic air emissions will persist and the disposal of toxic ash will continue to pose a threat to groundwater and soil when it is buried. Arguing that as much as 80 percent of the garbage can be recycled, consumer activist <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s 25 percent target a `` token recycling effort'' designed to `` provide a cloak of environmental legitimacy for incineration programs.'' <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> said all burning of municipal garbage should be banned. `` The 25 percent goal will not even begin to solve the garbage crisis,'' added <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, another environmental organization that has campaigned against gargage burning. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hershkowitz </PERSON>, an expert on solid waste issues for the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, called the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> proposal `` a positive first step'' but said its recycling requirement is `` far too modest.'' <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said that while the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> proposed the 25 percent recycling target, the agency has not ruled out the possiblity that the percentage will be increased when a final regulation is issued. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> proposal calls for air emission standards for both existing incinerators and for ones still on the drawing board. It would require incinerator operators to install scrubbers and other technology that would reduce emissions of toxic metals such as lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic and chromium by as much as 99 percent; organic chemicals such as dioxins and furans by 99 percent; and acid gases such as sulfur dioxide and hydrogen chlordie by 90 to 95 percent. The agency also would require tighter operating standards to ensure optimum combustion to reduce pollution and prohibit the burning of lead-acid batteries, which are the source of an estimated 60 percent of the lead emissions and residues coming from incinerators.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> is investigating procedures used in a study that helps set national air pollution standards amid allegations thata <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> professor ignored errors in the research, the university said Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> inquiry concerns the `` Six Cities'' study, which has been conducted at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> since 1974 to monitor the effects of air pollution, said <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Costa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Garsd </PERSON>, a former statistician at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> that he was dismissed from a research post in 1986 after he disclosed errors in the study to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Spengler </PERSON>, one of the professors working on the project. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> uses the information to set national air emission standards. `` They are checking some of the procedures and the data collection,'' Costa said. The action is the latest in a series of incidents that have raised questions about research integrity at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and other academic institutions. Last year, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> professor was forced to resign because of charges of plagiarism. <PERSON> Spengler </PERSON> was out of town Thursday and could not be reached for comment. But Costa, reading from a statement, said: `` We have absolutely no reason to believe that there is any evidence of scientific misconduct. We have every reason to believe that malevolence has led to the repetition of frivolous allegations.'' Costa said the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> inquiry apparently grew from the original allegations by <PERSON> Garsd </PERSON>, which he attributed to `` ill feeling'' from the ex-employee. <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON>, acting director of the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Integrity </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said she could neither confirm nor deny the existence of an inquiry. Speaking in general terms, however, she said an inquiry is a fact-finding process, in which officials determine if a formal investigation should be conducted into allegations of scientific misconduct. <PERSON> Garsd </PERSON>, who has sued <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> in a state court for alleged wrongful dismissal, now works for the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He declined to comment on the case Thursday. But <PERSON> Garsd </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crimson </ORGANIZATION> in November 1988 that he sent several memos to <PERSON> Spengler </PERSON>, one of the professors working on the project, but received no response. And in a previous interview with The Wall Street Journal, <PERSON> Garsd </PERSON> said he found errors, including mistakes already published in journals and other scientific literature, that misstated the levels of certain air pollutants in the cities being studied by up to 20 percent. <PERSON> Garsd </PERSON> told the newspaper he had not contacted the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> and had been unaware of the inquiry. <PERSON> Spengler </PERSON> has said that any errors discovered by <PERSON> Garsd </PERSON> were corrected and did n't appear in print, the Journal reported.

 Mutinous soldiers seized air force headquarters and two broadcast stations early Friday in an attempt to overthrow President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, and a plane bombed the presidential palace compound. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> vowed to smash the `` shameless and naked attempt,'' one of the most serious since a civilian-military uprising swept her to power in February 1986 and forced the late President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> into exile. A T-28 aircraft dropped two bombs in the compound of <LOCATION> Malacanang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION> at about 6:30 a.m. -LRB- 5:30 p.m. EST Thursday -RRB- and presidential guards responded with small arms fire. `` They're bombing us!'' a palace staff member cried over the telephone. `` We're going down!'' <PERSON> Lourdes </PERSON> <PERSON> Sytangco </PERSON>, the deputy presidential spokeswoman, said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> was safe. Ms. <PERSON> Sytangco </PERSON> said she could not give a damage report because no one could leave the building. Radio station <ORGANIZATION> DZRH </ORGANIZATION>, reporting from the palace, said three people were killed. The government appealed to all mayors to mobilize local police forces, and Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> asked Filipinos earlier Friday to `` support our democracy in this hour of challenge.'' `` An attempt to seize power by force is again being made at this moment,'' she said in a nationally televised address. `` Our forces have the situation under control. We shall smash this shameless and naked attempt once more.'' `` This nation must never be allowed to fall unto the hand of tyrants,'' she said. `` God is with us and we shall prevail. Those who wish to be kings are here once more, despite repeated rejections by the people.'' Cardinal <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Sin </PERSON>, Roman Catholic archbishop of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, urged his countrymen `` to support the duly constituted authority'' and the soldiers to end their rebellion `` in the name of God.'' Gen. <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON>, military chief of staff, acknowleged that rebels had seized Villamor Air Base, headquarters of the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> air force; the government broadcast center; a private television station; and the <ORGANIZATION> Ninoy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had only sketchy information and `` we're watching it closely. ... We're very concerned about it and we continue to support the democratically elected government of Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>.'' There was no indication who was leading the mutiny, and rebel soldiers would not say. They were believed loyal to renegade Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, who led an August 1987 coup attempt in which at least 53 people were killed. Soon after dawn, pro-government troops opened fire with recoilless rifles on rebels near the government broadcast center and rebels returned the fire, blocking the road with trucks. No casualty reports were available. Scattered shooting was reported at <LOCATION> Villamor </LOCATION>, near the airport. Soldiers sealed off several of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s main avenues. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> said the rebellion began shortly after midnight when about 200 Marines tried to enter <PERSON> Villamor </PERSON>. About two hours later, air force troops who had been guarding the gate left their posts and mutinous <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> took over security at the base perimeter. Rebels fired heavy weapons at the headquarters of the 205th Helicopter Wing, setting fire to the building. One Marine captain, who refused to give his name, said about 2,000 troops were involved in the sixth attempt to overthrow Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> since she took office. Truckloads of mutineers, wearing white arm bands and carrying red flags, entered the government radio and television station and the adjacent private station <ORGANIZATION> ABS-CBN </ORGANIZATION>. Pro-government troops surrounded the compound, but later withdrew, and the mutineers allowed civilian staff to leave. The significance of the red and white colors was not clear. After sunrise Friday, rebel troops deployed along the major expressway leading to southeastern <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> escaped from prison last year and remains at large. He gave clandestine interviews about a week ago warning Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> of impending trouble. Reinforcements took up positions during the night around Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s residence and her office at nearby Malacanang Palace. Tanks and trucks blocked the main street that runs by the palace. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> told reporters late Thursday mutineers apparently planned a full-scale coup attempt Friday, `` and for this reason I have placed all units in the affected areas in full alert status.'' He said the plot was discovered after 13 members of the army's elite <ORGANIZATION> Scout </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> late Wednesday sabotaged two communications transmitters 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> Col. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranjo </PERSON>, chief of staff of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Region </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said all 13 were in custody at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bonifacio </LOCATION>, headquarters of the Philippine army. <PERSON> Ranjo </PERSON> said three other officers were being sought. According to <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON>, the plot included plans to seize <LOCATION> Mactan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION>, 350 miles south of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, and may have involved units in central <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION>. Rumors of a new coup attempt swept <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> last month after a dispute over plans to reorganize the Philippine Constabulary. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is considering a proposal to abolish the Constabulary, a branch of the armed forces, and replace it with a civilian-controlled national police. Constabulary generals would be barred from joining the new force. Constabulary troops have staged protests in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION> against the reorganization plan. Public discontent with the <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> government has been growing because of rising prices, a critical shortage of electricity in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, allegations of corruption and the deterioration of the city's transport system. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>'s coup attempt in August 1987 was the bloodiest and most dangerous of the half-dozen revolts against Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. The colonel played a key role in the military mutiny that started the uprising against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who died in exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> on Sept. 28. He became disenchanted with Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, however, accusing her of failing to crush Communist rebels and rid the government of corruption. He was arrested in December 1987, but escaped from a prison ship in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> the next April.

 A police officer who shot a black motorcyclist testified in his own defense Thursday, telling jurors he fired only because he thought he was about to die. `` He just came straight at me and he just revved the motorcycle,'' officer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, 31, testified. `` He was just aiming at me. I was just only able to turn my body, draw my gun and shoot.'' The testimony was broadcast live on television and radio in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, where three days of racial violence broke out following the Jan. 16 shooting. <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> carried <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>'s testimony live nationally. Twice before in this decade, innocent verdicts favoring policemen accused of killing blacks have led to rioting, and the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> police forces are on alert for renewed violence. Prosecution witnesses testified that the Hispanic officer, who faces two counts of manslaughter in the deaths of the motorcyclist and a passenger, coolly took aim and fired as the bike was about to speed past him while being pursued by a police car. The defense was expected to put on one more technical witness Friday, after which rebuttal witnesses were scheduled. Court officials have not said when they expect the case to go to the jury. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> told the court he did not see the motorcycle until the last second because his attention was on the lights of the approaching squad car. He said he spotted the bike only after it crossed into the traffic lane where he stood. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>'s attorney <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> asked how close the motorcycle came. `` -LRB- So -RRB- close that I thought I might die, that I was going to be run over and I was going to die,'' the Colombian-born officer said with a light Spanish accent. `` I feared for my life.'' <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, who has served with the department for five years, described how the situation quickly degenerated as an angry crowd gathered around the two victims. The bullet struck the driver <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, 23, in the head, killing him instantly. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>'s passenger <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, 24, died the next day of head injuries suffered in the subsequent crash `` I was a target for every person there,'' <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> testified, saying he was `` getting hit right and left'' by rocks and bottles at one point. On cross-examination, prosecutors picked away at <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>'s testimony that he did not see the oncoming motorcycle until just before he drew and fired Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> pointed to testimony from two officers who interviewed <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> just after the incident. They said he told them he entered the street because he `` became aware'' a police car was chasing a motorcycle. `` I do n't recall,'' <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> answered repeatedly when asked if he had given different versions of the shooting to his supervisor and a homicide detective. He flatly denied some of their accounts, which stated he had even acted out the shooting. <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> ridiculed <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>'s testimony about his awareness of the motorcycle by pointing to other witnesses _ including the officer's partner, <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> _ who said they heard a motorcyle speeding loudly up the street `` No, I did not hear the motorcycle,'' <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> insisted. `` I never heard it coming.'' The prosecution had shown photos of <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> together earlier in the trial to suggest they had concocted the story that the motorcycle almost hit him. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> testified the photos were taken at the scene of a minor accident that occurred after the shooting, and said he and Ms. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> had never discussed the shooting. `` You asked <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> to lie for you that night, did n't you,'' <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> challenged `` No, I never spoke to <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> that night,'' <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> said, adding `` Not about lying.'' Expert defense witnesses have attempted to counter testimony for the prosecution that <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> violated <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police policy when he failed to step out of the roadway, and then fired at a moving vehicle. When the case opened Oct. 23, the defense attempted unsuccessfully to move the trial, arguing that <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> juries will be too worried about renewed violence to acquit <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>. The defense also lost a battle to challenge a black juror. The final six-member jury consists of two blacks, one Hispanic and three non-Hispanic white jurors, as well as two Hispanic and two non-Hispanic white alternates.

<TEXT>
 The jury that convicted Rep. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukens </PERSON> for having sex with an underage girl should have been allowed to review her school and juvenile records, the congressman's attorney told an appeals court Thursday. The prosecution contended that the girl's past was irrelevant to the case against the 58-year-old Republican. After hearing 40 minutes of argument in <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' bid to overturn the conviction, a three-judge panel of the 10th <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> took the case under advisement. It could take several months for the court to rule. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> was convicted May 26 in <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Domestic Relations Court on a misdemeanor charge of contributing to the unruliness of <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON>. She testified that in November 1988, when she was 16, <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> paid her to have sex with him at his <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> apartment. Judge <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Solove </PERSON> would not let <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' attorney, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyack </PERSON>, introduce Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON>'s school and juvenile records into evidence at the trial. <PERSON> Tyack </PERSON> said he has not seen the girl's juvenile record, but it would have given the court a chance to determine Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON>'s credibility and motive He said her school records show she had a tendency to fantasize, often defied authority and had exhibited psychological problems.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> denied on Thursday that the crash of a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> plane in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> indicated the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was acting like the Nicaraguan government it has accused of helping leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Department spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> refused to confirm publicly, as other officials have said privately, that the plane was on a covert <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> mission to resupply Angolan rebels. However, she responded to suggestions at a news briefing of a parallel between the crash and a similar incident over the weekend involving equipment that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> officials say had been earmarked by <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. `` I would point out to you the fact that there is a regional peace agreement signed by <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, committing the signatories not to support subversion of neighboring countries. The Nicaraguans are clearly violating this obligation,'' she said. This was a reference to the twin-engined <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> that went down last Saturday in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> while carrying surface-to-air missiles and other equipment. The Salvadoran government and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> charged that the plane originated in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> but Sandinista authorities denied that. On Wednesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said an L-100 cargo plane flying from a military base in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> crashed while carrying supplies to rebels fighting <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s leftist government. They said a huge fireball was created on impact, suggesting that the plane was carrying large quantities of weapons. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said all four Americans on board are believed to have died. The plane crashed not far from the <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebel headquarters in southeastern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The Angolan government issued a statement Wednesday confirming the crash but gave no new details. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, noting that the crash took place in rebel-held territory, said it was doubtful the Angolan government had any independent information about the incident. The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, Rep. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolpe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mich </LOCATION>., said he hoped the crash and its `` wholly unnecessary loss of lives'' would prompt the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to reconsider its policy of supplying weapons to <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> Covert <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the war `` runs counter to our diplomatic efforts'' in the region and undermines the credibility of both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> when they seek peaceful solutions to the conflict, <PERSON> Wolpe </PERSON> said. Improving U.S.-Soviet relations have provided new opportunities for diplomacy around the world, <PERSON> Wolpe </PERSON> noted. But he added: `` I do n't think our policy in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> has caught up with the changing dynamic.'' The Angolan statement used the occasion of the crash to accuse <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> of showing no interest in a peaceful settlement to their 14-year old conflict. The statement said that the country's <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops had indicated support for the <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> position by calling for a cease-fire and free elections, but that the plane incident showed who really wanted peace in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration also has been an advocate of free elections as the best hope for a peaceful outcome in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in his discussions with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> this weekend, is expected to press for that option rather than engage in debate over aid levels to the opposing factions in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. According to some estimates, the Soviets have been providing $ 800 million a year to the Angolans while <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance for the rebel forces is said to be in the $ 40 million to $ 50 million range.

<HEAD>Cocaine Addicts Risk Heart Attacks Even After Withdrawal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Cocaine addicts are in danger of suffering heart attacks even for a few weeks after they stop taking the drug, a group of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> researchers reported. Researchers from the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> report that the effects of cocaine may linger after withdrawal, altering the balance of chemicals in the brain that direct the cardiovascular system. Other scientists studying how cocaine affects the heart said the report offers `` compelling'' evidence of the risk of heart attacks and may have implications for drug treatment. The report appears in the Philadelphia-based journal <ORGANIZATION> Annals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in the issue being published Friday. Young abusers often experience fatal heart attacks while using cocaine. The 1986 deaths of <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> basketball star <PERSON> Len </PERSON> <PERSON> Bias </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Browns </ORGANIZATION> football player <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> were both ascribed to cocaine-induced heart failure. But the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> study, which measured the heart function of 21 men who were in a substance abuse treatment program, discovered that addicts may experience abnormal heart activity for as long as four weeks after quitting cocaine. The report's lead author, Dr. <PERSON> Koonlawee </PERSON> <PERSON> Nademanee </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> medical center, warned that the first few weeks after withdrawal are crucial. `` I feel that during withdrawal, patients should be carefully monitored. The most important thing is to make sure the patient is completely abstinent from the drug,'' he said. The researchers found that eight of the 21 subjects had episodes of abnormal blood flow to the heart. They speculated that cocaine had upset the balance of chemicals in the brain that prevent the arteries from undergoing spasms, making heart attacks more likely. A heart attack causes the death of part of the heart muscle. It occurs when arteries that are narrowed or blocked keep a section of the heart from getting enough oxygen, which is carried in the blood. Cocaine restricts blood supply to the heart while increasing the heart rate, blood pressure and demand for oxygen. `` This is the strongest evidence to date that cocaine may cause spasming of the coronary arteries,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Isner </PERSON>, a cardiovascular medicine professor at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` This really is incontrovertible evidence,'' he said, calling the study a `` spectacular report.'' But <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkerson </PERSON>, who studies the cardiovascular effects of cocaine at the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION>, cautioned that researchers do not have enough evidence to attribute the heart attacks to spasms of the arteries. Some scientists argue that the heart attacks could be caused instead by clots forming in the arteries or simply by blood flow inadequate to the heart's demand, he said. One member of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> group, Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorelick </PERSON>, now with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION>, said the group ruled out heart disease as the cause of the temporary heart abnormalities in the subjects. `` With longer periods of abstinence from cocaine, the -LRB- blood flow -RRB- went back to normal,'' he said. The report has immediate impact on how emergency room physicians will treat addicts experiencing chest pains, according to Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Spivey </PERSON>, chief of emergency room research at the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. `` It's going to make us realize that we're going to have problems -LRB- after withdrawal -RRB- with these cocaine addicts,'' said <PERSON> Spivey </PERSON>. The study `` opens our eyes'' to the value of preventive medical treatment for addicts withdrawing from cocaine, said Dr. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaer </PERSON>, a cardiologist at Rush-Presbyterian-St. <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>'s Medical Center in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> An estimated 25 million Americans have used cocaine at least once, including 6 million regular users and 1 million addicts, according to <PERSON> Isner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorelick </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> scientists now plan to focus on how cocaine use alters the chemicals in the brain to reduce the flow of blood to the heart and use other, more precise tests to examine heart function in cocaine addicts.

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Following are excerpts from the official English-language text of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s speech Thursday evening at the Campidoglio, <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s city hall: `` Our time is indeed a watershed of destiny ... We need spiritual values. ... We need a revolution of the mind. ... Of late, there has been much talk in the West that the world community will really become a single whole only if the ` other side,' i.e. the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, abandons its ideological and social values. Frankly, we are often told that we should purely and simply renounce socialism. Then, it is said, the world will become a nice and easy place to live in. It may sound simplistic, but I am deliberately reducing the argument to its essence. This is not the approach that the world needs as it is taking a great turn to a new era. It is another example of wishful thinking of the temptation to make policies on the basis of illusions rather than reality. ... We have abandoned the claim to have a monopoly on the truth; we no longer think that we are the best and that we are always right, that those who disagree with us are our enemies. We have now decided, firmly and irrevocably, to base our policy on the principles of freedom of choice, to build our economy and technology on the principle of mutual advantage, and to develop our culture and ideology through dialogue and acceptance of all that is applicable in our conditions, and hence, all that should be digested and used for our own progress. ... Unless we get rid of all things associated with the deformations of socialism in the past, we will not succeed in implementing the ideas of perestroika. ... We want to give second wind to the Soviet federation. Quite frankly, it will take deft handling. For inter-ethnic relations is a fragile and delicate sphere. But perestroika will enable us to solve this problem, crucial for the future of our state. We have changed our attitude to some matters _ such as, for example, religion _ which, admittedly, we used to treat in a simplistic manner. ... But now we not only proceed from the assumption that no one should interfere in matters of the individual's conscience; we also say that the moral values which religion generated and embodied for centuries can help in the work of renewal in our country, too. ... Today, the focus is on the socialist world. Having embarked upon the road of radical reform, the socialist countries, one after another, are crossing the line beyond which there is no return to the past. Nevertheless, it is wrong to insist, as many in the West do, that this is the collapse of socialism, the end of the socialist system. On the contrary, it means that the socialist process in the world, having accumulated extensive, although admittedly dramatic experience, will pursue its further development in a multiplicity of forms. It will thus acquire new opportunities for moving toward its just and noble goals, for releasing the enormous humanistic and democratic potential contained in the socialist idea. ... Let us leave it to experts in anti-communist propaganda to rejoice in the ` triumph of capitalism' in the Cold War. ... We hope that next year all European countries, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> will sign a historic document which will begin a new countdown in the area of military policy. ... My meeting with President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will, I am convinced, enable us to take a new constructive step in the movement ` from mutual understanding to mutual action' in Soviet-US relations. ... I believe that this year's events underscore the desirability of an all-European summit, a Helsinki-2 meeting. We could consider advancing its date from 1992 to, say, as early as 1990. ... In the final analysis we envision <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as a commonwealth of sovereign democratic states with a high level of equitable interdependence and easily accessible borders open to the exchange of products, technologies and ideas and wide-ranging contacts among people.''

<HEAD>As Airport Hotel Has Grand Opening, Radar Dispute Renewed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A hotel built too close to an airport radar because of a typographical error had its grand opening Thursday, renewing air traffic controllers' complaints that it blocks some radar coverage. The controllers dispute the government's claim that keeping planes at high altitudes above the blind spot is a temporary solution. `` It's just as bad if not worse,'' said <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Readio </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Controllers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` We still ca n't see airplanes in that area.'' Controllers said they would like to see the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> make a stronger response to an `` unsatisfactory condition report'' filed in May. At the time, controllers noticed that as the six-story Quality Suites hotel went up, more and more planes began disappearing from the radar screen. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> conducted tests that showed gaps in radar coverage up to about 2,000 feet in a corridor of air space up to seven miles wide and extending about 25 to 35 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jetport </LOCATION>. Until the radar can be moved, the agency adopted interim guidelines under which airplanes going through the area are kept well above 2,000 feet, said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Claxton </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> tower manager at the airport. `` I ca n't say the problem is completely solved,'' <PERSON> Claxton </PERSON> said. `` We set up the interim procedures until the problem is solved. If it was a real safety issue, the radar would have been moved two months ago, or we'd put a new one in.'' <PERSON> Claxton </PERSON> said only small planes are affected, because larger planes are not flying that low when they are 30 miles out. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Breen </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> representative of the air traffic controllers association, said controllers also have to keep jetliners out of the area even if they are at a high altitude because pilots can not be advised about what might be flying under them. Ms. <PERSON> Readio </PERSON> said commercial flights from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> often go near the area, and controllers have to make sure they stay away from the blind spot. `` We ca n't tell them what's there,'' <PERSON> Breen </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Bradley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, just north of <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` The system could be safer by getting this radar moved soon.'' <PERSON> Claxton </PERSON> said the radar might be moved within the next year. `` We're going to move the radar,'' <PERSON> Claxton </PERSON> said. `` Where we're going to move it, I'm not sure It kind of sits low on the airport, and things were fine until the building came along.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said it never objected to the hotel construction because when the project was first proposed, the developer's plans contained a typo that indicated the building would be 12,000 feet from the runway when it was in fact just 1,200 feet from the runway. <PERSON> Breen </PERSON> blames the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> for the mixup. `` Twelve-hundred feet and 12,000 feet are quite a bit different,'' <PERSON> Breen </PERSON> said. `` Typo or not, you'd think somebody would have noticed it.''

 A former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent who fled to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> just before he was charged with passing secrets was recently ordered expelled from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Thursday. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government urged <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to permanently bar <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, a defector wanted on an espionage charge who has made extended visits to the eastern block country, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. In 1985, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> eluded <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> surveillance near his home in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, and fled the country two days before he was charged in a warrant with passing secrets to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He later turned up in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> announced nearly a year after his defection that it had given <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> political asylum. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, 37, is charged with selling secrets to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for $ 6,000 in 1984 during a trip to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. He is said to have exposed the network of <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> contacts in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, a spy post for which he was trained but never assigned to because he was fired in 1983. `` He certainly gave away the entire <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> operation in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON>, author of the 1988 book about the <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> case entitled `` The Spy Who Got Away.'' Wise reported in the book that <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> was paid more than $ 150,000. One official confirmed that <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> was still in the Soviet bloc. Wise said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> was probably in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> where he has an apartment and a nearby summer house. Besides exposing dead-drop locations and codes the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> employed to contact Soviet contacts, <PERSON> Wise </PERSON> said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> exposed details of electronic eavesdropping the agency conducted in the Soviet capital. `` There was n't much he did n't give up,'' Wise said. <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> made a veiled reference to <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>'s expulsion when asked by reporters Wednesday about cooperation between intelligence agencies of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and Eastern bloc nations <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> cited the case of a `` a prominent defector from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -LRB- who -RRB- was permanently expelled from a bloc country which had provided him comfort and sanctuary in the past.'' `` And that would have been contrary to the wishes of the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, who did n't identify <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> or the country by name. But the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials confirmed a report in Thursday's editions of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times that <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> was referring to <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>'s expulsion from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> Asked about the report, <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. Col. <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Horvach </PERSON> said in a telephone interview, `` It's news to me.'' <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> refused to comment about the case. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>'s handler during a recent visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON>, who was the No. 2 KBG official at the time he was directing <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> case was not discussed during the meeting at <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. The meeting was scheduled `` only to talk about areas where there could be discussion on cooperation in the law enforcement area,'' including efforts to combat terrorism, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. Wise, who interviewed <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> for his book during a visit to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, said the former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent spent a lot of time in that country, enjoying visits to <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bolatov </LOCATION>, a resort area. `` I would doubt if he would set foot in the West'' for fear of being snatched by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents, <PERSON> Wise </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> was even nervous about visiting <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, where he feared the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> could inject a tranquilizer in his arm and spirit him across the Austrian border, <PERSON> Wise </PERSON> said. Given the current political climate in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wise </PERSON> said it is most likely that <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> has returned to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, where he would feel safe from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to arrest him. While <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> would not be subject to extradition from a Western country because espionage is a political crime, <PERSON> Wise </PERSON> pointed out that he might feel threatened by the new overseas snatch authority conferred on the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. A legal opinion issued last June by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had the legal authority to seize <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fugitives overseas without the permission of a foreign government. Wise reported in his book that <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> was paid handsomely for his spying by the Soviets. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> had $ 150,000 in a Swiss bank account before he defected and afterwards, his wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, led <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents to a spot in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> desert where her husband had buried $ 10,000 worth of gold and other valuables. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>'s wife, who lives in the <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> area with the couple's son, could not be reached for comment.

<HEAD>AMA Issues Patient ``Bill of Rights''</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Patients have a right to basic health care from attentive, courteous doctors who tell them their choices for treatment, according to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s first `` Patient Bill of Rights.'' In a brief list of six principles, the nation's largest physicians' organization spells out the responsibilities doctors have to those who seek their help. The document issued Thursday is being presented for approval at next week's meeting in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION>. The bill is a `` reaffirmation of what is inherent in the relationship of physician to patient,'' the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>'s general counsel, <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, said in a telephone interview Thursday. `` It is coming now not because physicians need to be reminded'' of their responsibilities, he said, but because patients need to `` know and retain their trust in the basic elements of their relationship with their physician.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said the bill of rights was devised over the past year by the association's Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION> may accept it as is, or send it back to the council for further explanation, he said. The bill of rights is `` something that patients can understand _ simple, straightforward and the minimum that patients can expect from their physicians,'' he said. It includes a patient's `` right to essential health care'' regardless of ability to pay and suggests in an attached commentary that `` physicians have a responsibility to provide some uncompensated care to the indigent.'' A critic of the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> immediately took issue with the document, saying that in many ways, the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> circumvents the bill's intent in its everyday actions. `` These are sort of apple pie, motherhood ideas, rights, which none could disagree with,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citzen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. `` There are two main problems: They -LRB- the principles -RRB- are n't enforceable and many of them run completely contrary to what the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> does and stands for,'' said <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, whose group, a Washington-based consumer health research and advocacy organization, is in its 18th year `` If they took action to ensure that these rights were translated into results for patients, it would be another thing. `` The <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> has hardly been at the forefront ... in ensuring that, for example, patients have access to information showing differences between hospitals and doctors.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> discounted the criticism, saying the bill of rights is `` valuable and needed.'' Patients, the document says, have the right to receive information and know the `` benefits, risks and financial costs'' of their treatment. They also have the right to make their own decisions on the treatment of their illness, it says. `` The patient has the right to courtesy, respect, dignity, responsiveness and timely attention,'' according to one article of the bill, which adds: `` Physicians have an obligation to schedule their appointments ... in a way that respects the value of the patient's time.'' The document's final principle says a patient `` has the right to continuity of health care.'' According to the attached commentary, `` The physician may not discontinue treatment of a patient as long as further treatment is medically indicated, unless alternative arrangements are available.''

<TEXT>
 The Sandinista-dominated <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> voted Thursday to strip opposition candidate <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON> of his immunity from prosecution as a deputy, opening the way for possible charges of mismanagement. Even before the vote, <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON> scoffed at the procedure. He called it part of a leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> plot to discredit him as vice presidential candidate of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and weaken the anti-government bloc. The 14-party bloc is the major rival of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> in Feb. 25 elections. `` What they have done today is a farce, and farces are performed by humbugs,'' <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON> said after the vote, which he boycotted. Sandinistas hold 61 of the 96 seats in the single-house legislature. Deputies from six opposition parties hold the remaining 35 seats. <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON> is president of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and one of its nine deputies in the assembly. The measure to strip him of his parliamentary immunity passed 61-1, with one abstention. A Conservative Democrat Party deputy voted against. A deputy belonging to a Liberal faction opposed to <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON> abstained. Thirty-three deputies were absent, including 21 opposition deputies. Accusations focus on items and about $ 60,000 donated to a Godoy-directed research center by the <ORGANIZATION> Friedrich-Naumann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The foundation said it was satisfied with how its donations were managed and called questions about the management `` baseless.'' <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON> says members of a rival <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> faction who questioned the center's handling of donations were put up to it by the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>.

 Testimony by survivors of the nation's worst drunken driving accident concluded Thursday with several badly burned teen-agers weeping as they detailed the horrible aftermath of the bus crash A weekend recess was called after the sixth day of testimony in the trial of <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, 36, charged with murder and drunken driving in the fiery crash on May 14, 1988, south of this <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> town. <PERSON> Christy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearman </PERSON>, 15, testified she cried out for her father, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearman </PERSON>, who was driving the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> of God church bus, as she struggled to escape the heavy smoke and flames inside. `` I turned around to see my dad and I saw the fire,'' she testified. `` I was standing in the aisle, yelling for my dad.'' He did not survive. Miss <PERSON> Pearman </PERSON> said she was trapped in her eighth-row window seat in the crush of panicked teen-agers making their way to a rear emergency door. She managed to free herself and began climbing over a bus seat to escape. `` The seat was so hot it melted my right palm,'' she said. Twenty-seven people died in the fire and 40 survived, but some with disfiguring burns. <ORGANIZATION> Carroll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Satterwhite </PERSON> called a 15-minute recess after <PERSON> Ciaran </PERSON> <PERSON> Foran </PERSON>, 16, of <PERSON> Radcliff </PERSON> broke down in sobs during testimony. Miss <PERSON> Foran </PERSON> sobbed heavily when asked by Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Richwalksy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to describe what she had seen seconds after the bus collided with a wrong-way driver on Interstate 71. Some jurors turned their eyes away from <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Foran </PERSON>, who was wearing a special pressure garment to assist healing of severe burns on her neck, face and shoulder. After the unscheduled break, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Foran </PERSON> testified that her head was resting on a plastic helium balloon that blew up in her face after the crash. Miss <PERSON> Foran </PERSON> spent about six weeks in a hospital and underwent 19 operations. Also testifying was <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Percefull </PERSON>, 16, who suffered first-and second-degree burns to his arm, legs, wrists and face. <PERSON> Percefull </PERSON>, who escaped through a crowded rear emergency door, told the court he saw his `` skin from the heat _ it rolled up on my arm.'' He also said he heard a sound like a match thrown on gasoline seconds after the collision. Other survivors told of falling unconscious as they were overcome with smoke and heat inside the bus, and somehow being pulled from the wreckage. They also told of losing friends inside the bus. <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> <PERSON> Aurentz </PERSON>, 15, of <PERSON> Radcliff </PERSON>, sobbed as she held small color pictures of <LOCATION> Kashawn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Etheredge </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Emillie </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, all of whom died in the wreck. In the courtroom gallery, family of victims and survivors wiped at tears and sniffled. The pictures were placed on a large seating chart of the bus to show the jury the exact location of each of the 67 passengers at the time of the crash. Some of the girls sat on the laps of boys, and some were lying in the aisle, asleep after a long day at a Cincinnati-area amusement park, according to testimony. Defense attorneys have said that they would argue that it was defects in the bus, which was manufactured before federal rules requiring more safety features went into effect, that led to the deaths. Later buses were required to have, among other things, better shielding around the gas tank. <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> surgeon Dr. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Malangoni </PERSON> testified that six of the survivors he treated would have died of suffocation if they had n't received prompt medical attention He also described amputating the severely burned foot of Miss Aurentz, who suffered burns over 55 to 60 percent of her body and has required extensive surgery. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> is charged with 27 counts of murder, 42 counts of wanton endangerment, 12 counts of assault and one count of drunken driving. Testimony is expected to move onto the 27 murder counts next week, but <PERSON> Richwalksy </PERSON> declined to say when that phase of the trial would begin.

<HEAD>Bush Fills Two Vacancies On Legal Services Board</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday filled two vacancies on the board of the <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on the eve of a scheduled vote to replace the organization's president <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Wear </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gave so-called recess appointments to former Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Erlenborn </PERSON>, R-Ill., and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blakely </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> to sit on the board that oversees the independent agency that gives legal help to the nation's poor <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made the appointments during the year-end recess of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, thus avoiding <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation proceedings. Under the Constitution, people given recess appointments can serve until the end of the congresional session _ in this case the end of 1990. The board meeting scheduled for Friday is the latest in skirmishing between two factions over the nature of legal services. The corporation's board has been a battleground for conservatives seeking to limit legal services, particularly class-action lawsuits against the government over welfare and other social programs. Conservatives also object to legal services representing plaintiffs in lawsuits to force hospitals to give abortions to indigent women. This faction held a 6-5 majority on the board until two vacancies recently occurred, said <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defenders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The group monitors the agency and supports efforts to allow legal services lawyers to provide a full range of representation, she said. Supporters of a broader range of legal services held a 5-4 majority on the board before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made the appointments on Thursday. The board was scheduled Friday to consider a move to oust Wear and demand an accounting of more than $ 100,000 spent to hire a former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration official to provide outside legal advice, <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. The money was paid for legal opinions provided by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, a former assistant attorney general in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and a conservative activist, <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. Those opinions include one by <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> that the corporation is unconstitutional. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said her organization did not know how <PERSON> Erlenborn </PERSON> would vote if he attended Friday's meeting. Now a private attorney in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Erlenborn </PERSON> was considered a supporter of legal services when he represented a suburban <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> congressional district, she said. Earlier this year, conservative activists successfully lobbied the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to stop the appointment of former Republican Rep. <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> to the board. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> had angered conservatives by stating he would not support restrictions on the activities of legal aid attorneys.

<TEXT>
 Twenty years after <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nason </PERSON> was killed, a former neighbor appeared in court Thursday and was charged with the slaying, and published reports said the man's own daughter gave the information leading to his arrest. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, 50, was arrested Tuesday at his home in <LOCATION> Carmichael </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, and charged with murdering the 8-year-old girl. He was held without bail on one count of murder. Investigators would not identify the witness who provided the tip that led to the arrest. But the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION>, quoting an unidentified law enforcement source, reported Thursday that <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>'s daughter, a former classmate of the dead girl, came forward and told investigators she witnessed the 1969 slaying. The source said the daughter had repressed all memory of the event, but finally recalled seeing her father bludgeon her friend to death with a rock in his van. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> disappeared while playing after school near her home in <LOCATION> Foster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Sept. 22, 1969. Her disappearance led to an extensive search in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area. A $ 20,000 reward was offered for the arrest and conviction of her killer by the employer of <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Nason </PERSON>, the girl's father. The girl's remains were found four months later under an old mattress at an abandoned gravel pit near the <LOCATION> Crystal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reservoir </LOCATION> about 20 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. She had been killed with a blunt instrument that fractured her skull, investigators said. <PERSON> Nason </PERSON>, who lives in the same <LOCATION> Foster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> home with his wife, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON>, said he never gave up hope a suspect would be arrested in his daughter's killing. `` The law has a very long memory,'' he said. `` After 20 years _ almost on the anniversary and it's pretty close to the day _ it's something you hope for all this time. <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mateo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> said detectives believe <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> killed the girl because he had tried to sexually molest her. At <LOCATION> Carmichael </LOCATION>, a suburb of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, a close friend of <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> said the arrest shocked them both. `` I talked to him today, and he's still in shock. He has absolutely no idea what's happening or why or anything,'' said the friend, who declined to identify herself. `` I certainly do believe he is innocent.'' <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> retired to the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> area several years ago after a long career with the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mateo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said the friend. The woman said <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> is a licensed real estate agent but is not currently working. `` He's an outgoing man, a delightful person,'' the woman added.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> headed Thursday for his first summit with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, saying the two have a `` powerful and historic opportunity'' to work for peace. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in a speech in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, called for a 35-nation meeting next year to speed the integration of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Urging an end to East-West divisions, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the changes sweeping <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and toppling hard-line communist regimes are irrevocable. He said they do not signal `` the collapse of socialism'' but, rather, further development of a concept with noble goals and `` enormous humanistic and democratic potential.'' `` I'm ready and confident,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at a farewell ceremony in the White House Rose Garden a few hours before departing <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, aboard the presidential jet. He labeled himself and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as `` envoys for positive, productive change.'' He praised <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as a man `` looking for ways to keep those reforms moving forward, and I'm looking for ways to promote democracy and freedom.'' `` And today,'' the president said, `` the people of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> toast the dawn of a new <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' Aboard Air Force One shortly after takeoff, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters, `` We're about on the same wavelength, from what I've heard from the briefings'' by <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> leaders who had recently spoken with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Half a world away, authorities on the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> were busy mobilizing the military _ and even the boy scouts _ in preparation for the superpower leaders. Not even a shortage of tiny, wavable <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> flags was enough to hamper the preparations, said <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafrace </PERSON>, who reported selling 160 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maltese </LOCATION> flags a day from his little toy store behind the Palace of the Grand Masters in <LOCATION> Valletta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will meet Saturday, beginning 11 -LCB- hours of talks over two days on warships anchored off the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. Addressing 300 administration officials, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` This meeting represents a point of departure, the beginning of a process as full of promise as any that we've ever known. `` And given the remarkable and rapid change in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' he said, `` our meeting will be yet another important step in this long but hopeful journey toward a <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that is indeed whole and free.'' The discussions are expected to focus on the reforms in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, negotiations to cut nuclear arms and conventional forces, trade issues, and regional disputes, including a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> complaint about Soviet-made weapons shipped to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for his `` efforts to relax the grip of the centralized government, to move toward pluralism and the free expression of ideas.'' Calling the changes in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` dramatic,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I believe the people of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> can see that Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and I _ East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> _ are not in some kind of competition. Rather, we're both working to make the world a more peaceful one. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who originally described the summit as an informal, get-acquainted meeting, used the word `` historic'' three times to describe the weekend talks. `` Ours is a powerful and historic opportunity, made possible by a continuing <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> commitment to the -LRB- Western -RRB- Alliance and its defense,'' he said. As <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was preparing to leave, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, and 32 other members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> urged him to give priority in his talks to ending the rule that imposes high <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tariffs on Soviet imports. The president has authority to waive the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, a provision in the trade law that denies `` most-favored-nation'' status to the Soviets because of their limits on emigration. It will be the first superpower summit since <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> met then-President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Governor's <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> on Dec. 7, 1988. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, vice president at the time, sat in on those talks. Since then, a tide of democracy has swept over <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, removing from power authoritarian communist regimes in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslavakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. Only <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> has spurned the reforms initiated by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> after he rose to power in March, 1985. In the text of an interview released Thursday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> prodded <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> to get in step with its Eastern European neighbors. `` My God, I'd like to see some action there,'' he said. `` ... I'd like to see them come into the New World and not deprive their people of a chance to be independent and free.'' Looking ahead to the summit, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and I see eye to eye on what our upcoming meeting is all about. We both want to build a sustained relationship for real achievements over the long term.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> have expressed support for the changes and said they want them to be carried out peacefully. In the <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> speech following his talks with Italian government leaders, the Soviet president said the 35-nation meeting he called `` <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> 2'' should be moved up from 1992, as originally called for under the 1975 <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accords </ORGANIZATION> on human rights and security in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He made the proposal in a speech from the Campidoglio, <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s city hall, where the treaty was signed in 1957 establishing the European Common Market On the eve of his historic meeting with <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, he said that Soviets have changed their attitude toward religion and now believe religious values can help in the restructuring of Soviet society. Aboard Air Force One, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked by reporters about <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposal. The president replied: `` I'll talk to him.

<HEAD>Third Man Sentenced in Ethiopian's Death</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The third man charged in the racially motivated beating death of an Ethiopian student has been sentenced to 20 years in prison. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Strasser </PERSON> had pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter in the Nov. 13, 1988, slaying of 27-year-old <PERSON> Mulugeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Seraw </PERSON>. <PERSON> Strasser </PERSON> asked for leniency before sentencing Wednesday but <ORGANIZATION> Multnomah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> called the death a `` shocking and horrendous crime.'' `` I'll never again be a part of a group that advocates violence,'' <PERSON> Strasser </PERSON> said in a statement to the judge. But <PERSON> Strasser </PERSON> stopped short of denying that he harbored racist views when questioned by <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>. <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> read from a report by a psychologist who concluded after interviewing <PERSON> Strasser </PERSON> that he `` felt pride in the concept of the white working man but that he did not have extreme racial views.'' When <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> asked if that was how he felt, <PERSON> Strasser </PERSON> replied: `` I did n't necessarily say that. I think people should have a right to belong to a group.'' <PERSON> Strasser </PERSON>, 21, was a member of <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Side </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pride </ORGANIZATION>, a group advocating white supremacy. Two other members of the same group, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Mieske </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON>, pleaded guilty to murder and manslaughter, respectively, in <PERSON> Seraw </PERSON>'s death. <PERSON> Strasser </PERSON> joined White Pride `` partially out of loneliness and wanting to belong to a group,'' said his attorney, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Haslett </PERSON>. `` He is just a nice young boy whose life is ruined.'' Besides manslaughter, <PERSON> Strasser </PERSON> also pleaded guilty to second-degree assault for striking another victim. He pleaded no contest to a charge of racial intimidation arising from the same incident.

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> official Thursday warned Lithuanians that their efforts to form an independent <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would hurt national reforms, while party members across the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> pushed for more freedom from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` The aspiration of certain forces to drive a wedge between the <ORGANIZATION> Lithuanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will benefit no one but will only complicate the process of perestroika,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> ideology chief and a member of the ruling Politburo, as telling Communists in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>. Despite the well-publicized Kremlin hostility to the Lithuanians' intentions, 39 Communists in neighboring <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, including eight members of the local party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, called for founding a `` politically, organizationally and economically independent'' <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` Many party organizations in the republic look at the address of the 39 Communists as a call for the splitting of the <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> party,'' the official news agency reported from <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>'s capital Meanwhile, in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, the third <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION>, the local party's ideology chief, <PERSON> Mikk </PERSON> <PERSON> Titma </PERSON>, said in an interview with his party's daily that he is `` certain'' the legal guarantee of the party's leading role in political life will be eliminated from <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s constitution. `` Some kind of coalition'' will then govern <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Titma </PERSON> said in the interview, printed in the Sunday edition of the Sovietskaya <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> newspaper. The political changes in the Baltic republics come against the backdrop of upcoming local elections across the country, which begin in some parts of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Dec. 10. For the first time nationwide, voters will be offered a choice of candidates for their local `` soviets,'' or governing councils. Party officials in the once independent Baltic republics have said they must have a free hand to set policies popular with voters or risk defeat. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, who was quoted by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, traveled to <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> Wednesday to take part in a high-level party meeting. He spoke Thursday to Vilnius-based delegates to a special congress of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which will open Dec. 19. On the congress agenda is a draft program proclaiming the republic's party `` a political force in the creation of an independent, law-governed <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> state.'' Since the days of Soviet founder <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leaders have rejected autonomy for local party organizations in the name of `` democratic centralism.'' Lithuanian party leaders were summoned to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Nov. 16 to make their intentions known to the full Communist Party Politburo, including Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> strongly opposes plans for the <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> party to separate from the national <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which he has headed since March 1985. At the meeting in <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> advocated more rights for the local parties in the 15 constituent Soviet republics, but only `` within the renewing <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. In <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, the dissident Communists called for renouncing the `` utopian goal of building Communist society and the dogmatic interpretation of Marxism-Leninism,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Despite criticism of the dissidents, the Latvian Politburo admitted `` it was losing the initiative'' and decided to organize working groups to draft the rules and program of the <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> party, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> also scheduled a plenum of its <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in January `` to renew its composition'' and make changes in the party apparatus, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said, indicating the likelihood of sweeping personnel changes. The declaration of the 39 Latvian Communists was printed by <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>'s major party and government newspapers, according to a telex sent to the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> bureau of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by the Latvian Popular Front, a grassroots pro-reform group.

<HEAD>House Delays Tax Debate As Democratic Leaders Scramble for Votes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL BEEGAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> adjourned Thursday without tackling a $ 1.2 billion tax-hike package that signaled the end of the economic boom dubbed the `` <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> miracle'' and triggered a `` firestorm'' of taxpayer protest. A Statehouse switchboard operator said she was handling 100 calls every 15 minutes from irate taxpayers. Speaker <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Keverian </PERSON>, after a day of vote hunting, recessed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> without opening debate on the package approved Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. It includes hikes in sales, capital gains and gasoline taxes. `` Considerable time has gone by today and I apologize to many of you who have been here waiting for the beginning of debate,'' <PERSON> Keverian </PERSON> said. `` Our position is the same as it was. We intend to make some refinements and some suggestions tomorrow.'' The committee's package would add two cents to the sales tax, increase the gas tax by 10 cents over the next two years and hike capital gains from 5 percent to 7.5 percent. Most increases would take effect Jan. 1, 1990, but the capital gains would be retroactive to last January. The proposal is the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s latest move to deal with the deficit, which a Ways and Means staffer said had swelled to $ 825 million. As the committee sent the proposal to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> held hearings on a $ 350 million House-approved package of spending cuts. <PERSON> Keverian </PERSON> said later Thursday the Democratic leadership would propose an amendment to lower the sales tax increase to 6 cents on the dollar, up from the current 5 cents. That would cost $ 190 million in new revenue this fiscal year and about $ 400 million next year. <PERSON> Keverian </PERSON> said the loss would be made up with additional cuts and possibly with additional revenue in the tax package. He said he did not anticipate any other significant changes, although he would not predict the outcome of a vote on a rank-and-file amendment he said he expects will be offered to remove the capital-gains tax hike from the bill. Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who had suggested he had some reservations about the package, urged approval, saying he realized taxes were unpopular but elected officials should take a tough stand. `` If there's anything we've got to have now it's fiscal stability,'' the governor said. `` And that's what this package is going to bring.'' The Republican minority leader, Rep. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, said the size of the package and the leadership's effort to rush it through were a losing combination. `` They failed to get it out because they're pushing an outrageous bill,'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said, adding that it had set off a `` firestorm of angry criticism from an angry public.'' `` The answer should be the same no matter what the package is. The answer should be no,'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Marjorie </PERSON> <PERSON> Clapprood </PERSON>, a Democrat and supporter of the package, predicted the sales tax increase would be lowered. `` I think it is clear as the package stands, we are short of the 81 votes needed to pass it,'' she said. <PERSON> Clapprood </PERSON> suggested shutting off the Statehouse switchboard and locking lawmakers in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chamber to get the bill passed. She said she got one call at home at 4:30 a.m. Thursday from a woman opposed to higher taxes. `` The whole state of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> has called,'' said one of the <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION>'s two switchboard operators who declined to give her name. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxation </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> was trying to con voters into accepting taxes by slashing human services and education budgets. `` The point is, are we going to give into this kind of blackmail?'' she said.

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION>, many waving white flags, on Thursday fled combat by leftist guerrillas that shattered the peace of their upscale neighborhoods and headed back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s Legal Aid office meanwhile issued a report concluding that soldiers carried out the Nov. 16 massacre of six Jesuit priests and their two domestic employees. Guerrillas fired their first anti-aircraft missile Wednesday but missed the target _ an air force A-37 jet fighter-bomber near <LOCATION> Zacatecoluca </LOCATION>, 25 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, a Western military source reported. A rebel statement said the insurgents would not use the missiles if government aircraft stopped bombing, strafing and firing rockets. Members of the Salvadoran high command have said missiles could signficantly alter the balance of power in the fighting. The civil war has gone on 10 years and killed 71,000 people. `` I'm not coming back,'' <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a teacher at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said as she carried her 8-month-old baby, <PERSON> Cassandra </PERSON>, down <LOCATION> Mirador </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> to where a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy official was waiting for her and her husband, <PERSON> William </PERSON>. Other Americans flashed V-for-victory signs at International Airport and shouted, `` We'll be back after Christmas!'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said `` departure is voluntary for all embassy dependents and personnel who are scheduled for leave or can be spared. We do not know how many private American residents will take advantage of this opportunity. We are encouraging American dependents and personnel who can be spared to depart.'' The <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> home, and 30 or 40 others in the exclusive <LOCATION> Escalon </LOCATION> neighborhood in the city's western sector, were taken by guerrillas before dawn Wednesday. Rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>, observed a six-hour truce beginning 6 a.m. -LRB- 7 a.m. EST -RRB- in their 20-day offensive, to permit evacuation of those who wished to leave. The neighborhood was quiet Thursday afternoon and remaining residents ventured out to assess damage and clear rubble. Soldiers moved cautiously along the streets and drew no fire. The last guerrilla snipers appeared to have pulled out from their nests in sumptuous homes. Most of the rebels appeared to have retreated up nearby <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> volcano by dawn. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> is maintaining a constant siege of the capital, which is the neurological center of the nation. The fuse of a social time-bomb has been lit,'' said the clandestine rebel radio Venceremos. About 20 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens were among scores of people who took advantage of the truce to leave <PERSON> Escalon </PERSON>. Many waved white flags and carried small bundles as they walked past a burned-out light tank, the bodies of soldiers and guerrilla barricades of expensive cars with the tires shot out. Military spokesmen said five soldiers and 12 guerrillas were killed in Wednesday's fighting. Reporters counted the bodies of at least 10 soldiers and saw one dead guerrilla, a woman still clutching her U.S.-made M-16 rifle. Four bodies unrecognizable as soldiers, guerrillas or civilians were burned on a sidewalk. About 150 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens left on the first of two charter flights arranged by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. They included embassy employees and dependents, and Americans living in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> for other reasons. Many had taken refuge in the embassy or the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, both well away from the fighting. Many luxury homes and automobiles were shot up, but residents of <LOCATION> Escalon </LOCATION> had few complaints about their treatment by the raggedy, unwashed invaders. `` They were kind and gentle,'' said <PERSON> Sheri </PERSON> <PERSON> McKibben </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, who was leaving with her husband, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said one rebel ventured out to bring fruit juice for her baby. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Vides </PERSON>, a 48-year-old businessman, used his 9mm pistol in a 20-minute gun battle with rebels who tried to enter his home, but surrendered after they fired a light anti-tank rocket at his house. `` They spared my life, and I have to thank them for that,'' he said. Guerrillas took over the home of retired <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mynus </PERSON>, former military attache at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. His wife, <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON>, said wounded guerrillas were treated there. They and their three children left Thursday. A young Salvadoran man whose house was occupied described the guerrillas as `` very respectful,'' but added: `` The very act of invading a civilian neighborhood and turning it into a combat zone is a great maliciousness on their part.'' In the report on the massacre at the <ORGANIZATION> Simeon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, the Church Legal Aid office said `` all the evidence and indicators establish that those responsible for the murder of the six Jesuit priests and their two domestics were members of the armed forces.'' It noted that the attackers wore army uniforms, according to a witness; they spent at least an hour shooting up part of the campus in the middle of a dusk-to-dawn curfew; the zone was militarized, with troops guarding southern access to the nearby headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>; the assassins used sophisticated arms, including flame-throwers, and burned some priests' offices, and soldiers searched the residence two days before the massacre. President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> has promised to find and punish those responsible. A small plane carrying 25 anti-aircraft missiles crashed Saturday in eastern <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The government said the plane and its four-man crew, all of whom died, were Nicaraguan, and broke diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. Missiles are presumed to have been delivered on another plane that landed Saturday in southern <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and was burned by its crew. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has not denied his country sent the weapons.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday reluctantly signed into law a bill creating a new independent inspector general within the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, two years after such a move was called for by congressional investigators of the Iran-Contra affair. The new law is one of three Iran-Contra related measures <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> sent to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the end of this year's legislative session. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> now has signed two, and is expected to approve the third, even though his administration believes the bills place unwarranted restrictions on its foreign policy activities. Creation of the new inspector general's office, similar to the oversight posts at other government agencies that review federal programs and seek to ferret out abuses, was part of a broader bill authorizing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence activities for the coming year. While the precise spending authorized by the bill is secret, it reportedly involves between $ 25 billion and $ 30 billion for intelligence collection and analysis, upgraded spy satellites and other hardware, and covert operations overseas. In a statement, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the new inspector general post `` could impair the ability of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to collect vitally needed intelligence information by creating a perception that confidentiality can not be guaranteed.'' To secure cooperation, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> `` must be able to assure foreign individuals and organizations that their identities, the fact of their association with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and the information they provide are not subject to expoure,'' added <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, himself a former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director. A day earlier, <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said while the provision could damage confidence of foreign intelligence services in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ability to keep secrets, he would seek to rebuild safeguards against compromising intelligence sources and methods. `` If it becomes law, we will do our best to make it work,'' <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his objections were mitigated by a provision that would let the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director kill any inspector general's investigation he believed might compromise national security interests He vowed he `` will resist any attempt by the intelligence committees to micromanage the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> through the vehicle of a statutory inspector general.'' The new inspector general would be appointed by the president and confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and the auditor's reports would be available to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committees that oversee <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence. Currently, the agency's inspector general is appointed by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director and reports only to him. That arrangement has caused friction with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which has been denied access to some reports. Congressional investigators who probed the Iran-Contra scandal said the agency's inspector general lacked independence and did n't have `` the manpower, resources or tenacity'' to uncover arms-for-hostages transactions or the diversion of profits to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contra rebels The implication was that as an underling of former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, who was deeply involved in the affair, the inspector general lacked the muscle to detect or report on Iran-Contra abuses. Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., chairman of the House Iran-Contra investigating panel, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s acceptance of the new inspector general provision was `` not easy for him to do It represents a concession on the part of the president, a deference to the congressional sensitivity on this.'' The bill also keeps on track a multibillion-dollar program to upgrade the nation's intelligence collection through so-called `` national technical means,'' or satellites and other electronic spying. The program apparently doubles the rate at which the government will be launching Lacrosse radar satellites, which orbit about 400 miles up and can penetrate darkness and cloud cover to take high-resolution pictures of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pike </PERSON> of the Federation of American Scientists. Impetus for the buildup began with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ratification of the intermediate-range nuclear arms control treaty with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which brought new requirements for verification, and has been given additional urgency by the likelihood of new strategic and convention arms control treaties with the Soviets in the coming months. Last week, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed a foreign aid bill that includes a warning against using <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid money as a `` leverage'' to induce recipients to carry out <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> policy goals that otherwise would be forbidden by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law. The provision is a reaction to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s apparent use of aid money as a reward to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> for harboring the Nicaraguan Contra rebels in its territory along the Nicaraguan border. Still pending, but expected to be signed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, is a bill that would impose criminal penalties on any official who permits sales of restricted arms to terrorist countries, a list that now includes <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The measure seeks to eliminate loopholes like the ones that permitted the arms-for-hostages deal with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday announced he was vetoing a bill to allow <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> students to remain in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after their visas expire, calling it unnecessary and an infringement on his presidential authority. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a statement that the measure was unneeded in light of administrative steps he had taken to accomplish the same ends _ including new measures taken Thursday. The president said he was directing the attorney general `` to take the steps necessary to extend administratively to all Chinese students in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the same benefits'' that were in the rejected bill. However, a congressional sponsor of the legislation, Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, D-Conn., accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of yielding to pressure from the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government, which had strongly opposed the measure `` I'm shocked that the president would kowtow in this way to the demands of the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> communist government, especially when that government was threatening Chiense students here in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and telling them that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was not going to protect them,'' said <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Judiciary subcommittee on immigration. And Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., said in a statement: `` I oppose the veto and I hope <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will override it The president should have stood up for the courageous <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> students, instead of bowing to the cruel Chinese regime.'' Democratic leaders had similar comments. Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, majority leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s action was a `` grave mistake,'' and Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., majority leader in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the No 2 position there, said it was a `` tragic error'' that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would make its `` first item of business ... when we return in January.'' The president said he was rejecting the legislation with a `` pocket'' veto, a procedural device available when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is in recess but has the same impact as a regular veto. When <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is in recess, a president can veto a bill by simply taking no action on it, or `` pocketing'' it _ thus the term pocket veto. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has gone home for the year. An override, as mentioned by <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, would have to be done through an entirely new bill in the 1990 session. Aboard Air Force One en route to the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> summit, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters he acted to preserve executive control of foreign policy. `` I want to keep control of foreign policy as much as I can,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Opposition is `` quite an emotional feeling, but I'm going to protect the office of the president. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> earlier criticized the measure, claiming it was unneeded because he already agreed to extend student visas in the aftermath of the government's bloody crackdown on protesters in <LOCATION> Tianenmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> in June. Congressional sponsors of the measure, however, said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s gesture did not go far enough and that many of the 40,000 Chinese students now studying in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had not taken advantage of it In most cases, visas for visiting foreign students are issued for two years. The bill <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoed would extend the Chinese students' visas for more four years and then give them a chance at applying for permanent residency. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the measure passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was another attempt by lawmakers to micromanage foreign policy. `` Such legislation puts <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in a straitjacket and can render us incapable of responding to changing circumstances,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Chinese and other foreign visitors should know that this is not an expedient or temporary action, but one reflecting fundamental American humanitarian values.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was re-emphasizing `` my commitment _ as I have told Chinese students in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and as I have told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ to never allow any action that would force the return of Chinese students if their lives or liberty are at risk.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also announced that he was expanding a program for offering political asylum to <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> visitors who opposed that nation's policy of forced sterilization or abortion to `` all foreign nationals, regardless of their country of origin. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law permits the admission to the country as refugees people who can show a well-founded fear of persecution at home. The administration has granted such a status to Chinese who claim they would be persecuted for their opposition to what the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government claims are coerced sterilizations and abortions in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s announcement would actually apply to anyone was not clear. No one has accused any other country of such coercive family planning policies.

 Americans give <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> more credit than President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for lessening East-West tensions, and nearly eight in 10 believe the Soviet leader seeks true reform in his country, according to a poll.

Their summit comes at a time of momentous change in the communist world. While <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> pushes reforms in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, his <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> European allies in recent weeks have moved dramatically away from political domination by their Communist parties.

 Injections of the natural disease-fighting protein interferon give doctors their first effective weapon against hepatitis C, a virus that infects at least 150,000 Americans annually, according to a report today. `` In my opinion, this is a major clinical advance,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>. The work appears to represent another milestone in a year of advances against this elusive virus. Until recently, doctors were sure of only two hepatitis viruses, type A and type B. Since many people got hepatitis without exposure to these viruses, their disease was simply labeled non-A, non-B. In April, researchers from <ORGANIZATION> Chiron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Emeryville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, reported the discovery of a new hepatitis virus, which they called hepatitis C. They said it is the principal culprit in non-A, non-B hepatitis. They also described a new test that will reveal whether blood is tainted with the virus.

 <PERSON> Johnnie </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> knows what it's like to be on death row, alone with his thoughts in the middle of the night. A thin man with pale skin and the long sideburns of a hustler, he spent 12 -LCB- years _ one-third of his lifetime _ on `` the row'' for his role in the 1973 slaying of a <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, woman, a killing he claims stemmed from a busted drug deal. `` On death row it's the waiting that really gets to you,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said during an interview at the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> State Prison at <LOCATION> Reidsville </LOCATION>. `` You feel so helpless. All you can do is sit there in your cell while some judge somewhere looks at your appeal and decides if you live or die. `` I used to stare at the wall of my cell for hours. I'd look at it for so long that pictures would start to appear on the wall and then _ and I know this sounds crazy _ but the pictures would start to move.'' Imaginary images are not only a torment, however. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s imagination has helped him escape _ through the prize-winning poetry he writes Still, prison officials say he's known best not as a writer but as a death row inmate who escaped _ literally _ in 1980. Wearing makeshift guard uniforms fashioned from pajamas, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and three other inmates broke out with outside help. `` The dye for the uniforms arrived in some stereo headphones, and the hacksaw blades were in the handle of a portable radio,'' he said. `` We sawed through the screen on an air vent and climbed through the vent to the roof. Then, we walked across the roof of the prison, in plain sight of the guard tower.'' He said they drove off in a car that had been left for them nearby. `` I was never so scared in my life,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> recalled. `` We were pretending to be inspecting the roof; I was sure the sniper in that tower would start shooting at any minute.'' They were recaptured three days later in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> During the long, bleak hours following his recapture <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> began writing poetry. He says it was an effort to keep from going `` stir crazy.'' `` Poetry was my safety valve on death row. You might be surprised to know that quite a few of the inmates here write poetry.'' The subjects are the same as those taken up by poets who are n't behind bars, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> says `` Unrequited love, how you feel about things, how people feel about you.'' Once a `` hell-raising kid'' from <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> has had plenty of time to think about such things. `` I come from a good family but I got into drugs in the 7th grade and went downhill,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> says. `` I quit school in the 10th grade and was on death row before I was 21.'' `` At my trial my lawyer told me to plead guilty and I'd get a life sentence,'' he recalls. `` But an election was coming up and the judge sentenced me to die.'' In a poem called `` Maturity,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> writes: `` Were we so wise as we lived by the needle and the gun? Is it really living when one comes so near self-destruction?'' In 1986 an appellate court ruled <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> had not had adequate legal counsel at his trial. His death sentence was overturned and he is now serving a life sentence. In his poem, `` Cellmate,'' he likens his situation to that of the tiny spider he discovers living in a remote corner of his death row cubicle. The poem won the top award in a national prison publications contest sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University-Carbondale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalism </ORGANIZATION> in 1987. The spider, he says in the poem, `` sits behind his sticky desk like a fat pompous official a tyrant who dictates to those below and so someday when his antics no longer please and I have grown tired of his presence his whole world will be swept away with one swish of the broom and this cell which some call a room will be more empty without him ... I wonder would he be consoled if he knew that I too await my fate and wonder what broom will sweep me away and how soon'' <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Marietta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, attorney whose work got <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s sentence overturned, said, `` He has managed to deal with his anxiety pretty well, for the most part.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who spends his days making license plates, said the hope that he'll get out of prison someday keeps him going. He has taken college courses while in prison and hopes to get a degree. `` Meanwhile,'' he says, I've got a life of sorts here, now that I'm off death row. I work, I interact with people. `` And then, too, there's always writing, or reading. I can get so involved writing, or reading a good book, that the walls disappear; I'm not even here.''

<HEAD>A Recession in Corporate Profits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Although the economy as a whole manages to continue expanding, business is beginning to suffer a profits recession. The situation is rare since corporate profits are such an integral part of the broader economy. But the evidence is overwhelming: While third-quarter gross national product rose 2.5 percent, corporate profits fell. Much of the decline was due to a non-recurring event _ money assigned by five big banks to cover anticipated losses on Third World loans _ but even without these losses corporate profits in general were off. While totals are not complete, profits for the companies making up the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500-stock index fell 22 percent to $ 4.98 a share from $ 6.38 a share in the third quarter of 1988. Excluding the banks the decline was 7 percent. A survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> showed a 21 percent drop in after-tax earnings on continuing operations, and another by Business Week indicated a 22 percent drop, with both declines negatively influenced by bank performance. Several industries performed much worse. Within the S & amp; P, 13 of 25 industry groups fell from their year-ago levels, compared with eight in the second quarter and just five in the first three months of the year. In addition to the financial sector, other big declines occurred in the automotive group, aerospace, printing and publishing. Reviewing the numbers, <ORGANIZATION> Wright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said it is unlikely to see a fourth-quarter repeat of big bank write-offs, `` but you never know.'' It said `` unusual charges and writeoffs have increasingly become a regular feature of fourth-quarter earnings reports.'' While a sluggish though still expanding economy has much to do with the declines, intense competition is playing a large role, typified by a 16 percent drop in <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' profits after it slashed prices in an effort to boost sales. Intense competition also marks the computer, fast-food and auto industries, with the latter attempting to raise prices only to be forced into renewed discounting. The auto group showed a 29 percent year-to-year earnings decline. While a decline of that magnitude is considered unusually sharp, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> points out that it could have been much worse, around 46 percent, if <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> had n't gained $ 300 million from the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> stock. Many economists believe that the decline will level off next year, but none can provide convincing assurance. The unusual event, such as the billion-dollar accident involving <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> this year, seems to have become less so. Moreover, while most forecasts for 1990 suggest the economy will continue to lumber along on the positive side of a recession-expansion line, global competition conceivably could continue to erode profits. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, continues to believe that the economy will expand in 1990, accompanied by a trend to lower interest rates and a moderation of inflationary pressures. `` The only big change for us is in the outlook for profits,'' he wrote this month. `` The economy is clearly experiencing a profits recession,'' he said, attributing it to competition. Looking on the brighter side of the situation, <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON> said he hoped consumers would respond favorably to discounted prices and cut-rate financing. If not, `` then the profits recession could become a growth recession as well.'' A growth recession is generally understood to mean an economy that manages to expand, but at such a meager rate that the difference between growth and shrinkage is little more than statistical.

<TEXT>
 People no longer leave chicken soup beneath the branches of the historic Treaty Oak, but well-wishers still send support from as far as <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for its struggle to survive a poisoning attack. Since the May 31 discovery that it was poisoned with a powerful herbicide, the centuries-old live oak has shed five sets of leaves. The sixth is sparse. It will be spring, though, before experts know the fate of the tree where legend has it that <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, the father of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, signed a treaty with the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>. The Handbook of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> says there is little foundation for that tale, but that has n't diminished the popularity of the landmark The oak is 50 feet tall and has a limb spread of about 120 feet. Throughout the summer, well-wishers brought cans of chicken soup, flowers and cards, and rock crystals that some believed would transmit healing powers. Visitors still pin get-well messages, woven friendship bracelets, ribbons and beads on a line strung around a barrier surrounding the tree. A West German company recently shipped organic fertilizer for the tree, which has undergone myriad treatments. Contaminated soil was replaced, and some roots were severed in a move to keep the tree from absorbing more poison. Shade screens were mounted on telephone poles to protect it from the summer sun, and it was misted with water to ease heat stress. A saltwater solution was pumped in to try to counteract the poison, followed by energy-giving sugar water. Recent tests show the level of the herbicide, <LOCATION> Velpar </LOCATION>, has been significantly reduced, said city forester <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Giedraitis </PERSON>. If leaves that bud next spring stay on the tree, `` We're in luck, and the tree will survive.'' Treatment has cost about $ 80,000, plus $ 40,000 worth of services. <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> billionaire <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> has pledged to cover the cash outlay. The man charged with felony criminal mischief in the poisoning has been waging a battle of his own. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stedman </PERSON> <PERSON> Cullen </PERSON>, 45, of <PERSON> Elroy </PERSON>, has been in jail since his June 29 arrest, unable to make $ 20,000 bail or get it reduced. Because of a prior felony conviction, he could face life in prison if convicted in the poisoning, which authorities say may have been done in some sort of ritual. If an effort to quash <PERSON> Cullen </PERSON>'s indictment fails, defense attorney <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said he will try to get the case moved out of <LOCATION> Travis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Some people have suggested that the tree's poisoner should be hung from its branches `` This city basically has been transformed into a city of druids, tree-worshippers. People that never heard of the <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> before _ would n't know the <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> from a cactus _ are now clamoring for blood,'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said. Vengeance is n't the only emotion evident, however. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Israel </PERSON>, who lives across the street from the oak and picnicked under its branches as a child, is growing seedlings from its acorns. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said he hopes some seedlings could be planted in the Treaty Oak's place if it dies. An enterprising entrepreneur sold T-shirts bearing a drawing of the oak superimposed on a red heart. The sales raised more than $ 15,000 for a special Treaty Oak fund to finance tree plantings citywide. Well-wishers sent a post card addressed to `` Treaty Oak, <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>'' _ and a postal worker delivered it to the tree. An <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> foundry worker suggested bronzing the tree if it dies, at a cost of more than $ 1 million, and replanting the metal replica. While the spring growth will be a milestone, <PERSON> Giedraitis </PERSON> said, it could be two years before the tree is `` out of the woods.'' Even if it lives, it always will bear the effects, he said, like a tree that has been struck by lightning. But no matter what it finally looks like, the Treaty Oak is special to visitors like <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Lounsbury </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` I'm a tree person. ... To me, this is how a tree is supposed to look,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Lounsbury </PERSON>. `` Well, not with the dead leaves, but the shape.'' `` We come here to see this thing, how it's doing, every time we come to <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Immell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>. `` We came to wish the tree well,'' added his wife, <PERSON> Margot </PERSON>.

<HEAD>NBC's `True Blue' Cop Show Premieres</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> on Friday nights, the <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> beaches are protected by `` Baywatch,'' and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, by `` Mancuso, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>.'' Now, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is going to be more or less safe then, too. A new police series, `` True Blue,'' is joining <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s lineup next Friday. The show, for which `` Hardball'' was temporarily taken off the network's active-duty roster, is getting a two-hour premiere this Sunday. The newcomer is about the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION>, whose troops specialize in all manner of rescues. They also pack artillery, however, because they are cops and there are bad guys out there. Sometimes they have to shoot and rescue simultaneously. That's made amply clear Sunday in a clinker of a subplotline that has a squad of <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> terrorists at large in <LOCATION> Fun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, plastic explosives and Uzis at the ready The baddies, of course, are evil incarnate. Not only do they plot to blow up the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, which would halt even junk bond sales, they later kidnap a school bus full of children of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> diplomats and threaten to blow them up. The show is rife with high-tech police gear, including an armored truck to end all armored trucks. It also has a lot of dumb-dumb disco music that usually cranks up as our compassionate heroes set forth on missions of high drama. And if Sunday's epic is typical, the lads in blue will always succeed, in contrast to a pretty good <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> cop series of yesteryear, `` Police Story,'' in which not all stories had a happy ending. But there are two bright sides to `` True Blue,'' although it must be said its debut wastes guest star <PERSON> Amanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Plummer </PERSON> in a role of few lines and many squints as your basic Anglo-Saxon female member of your basic <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> terrorist cell. True, the opener _ it also has <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> LoBianco </PERSON> guest-starring as <PERSON> Doc </PERSON>, one of the <ORGANIZATION> ESU </ORGANIZATION> cops _ spends much time introducing the show's 11 regulars and their backgrounds The regulars include a Russian immigrant -LRB- <PERSON> Elya </PERSON> <PERSON> Baskin </PERSON> -RRB-, a free-lance TV cameraman who continually pesters the emergency constables. And yes, a beautiful woman cop -LRB- Ally Walker, cast as a divorced mother who also is a registered nurse -RRB- joins this traditionally male bastion and must face its macho ways, which are surprisingly subdued here. But <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, like most in the cast, has a strong theater background. It gives her and her relatively unknown colleagues a definite edge in salvaging bad lines and generally making their characters close to believeable. It also helps that one of the show's three executive producers is <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosso </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> detective famed for his part in the city's French Connection narcotics case that later became a movie, naturally. With <PERSON> Grosso </PERSON> at the helm, you get a good taste of the closeness of cops, the practical jokes they play on each other, and the wild human comedy that can be found in some of the most tragic situations cops face. One example in Sunday's show: A distraught man threatens to leap from a building. He tells the cops he wants a priest to hear his confession before he jumps. A young cop -LRB- <PERSON> Nestor </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> -RRB- posing as a hard-of-hearing padre arrives. As part of the rescue plot, <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> edges closer to the would-be-leaper, saying he ca n't hear him. The man erupts: `` You sent a deaf priest to hear my last confession ... God, I HATE NEW YORK!'' Sunday's effort has the usual suspects of routine cop-show life, specifically two shootouts with the terrorists. The second is part of a predictable finale in which a helicopter and a truck trailer each go boom. But there is potential in `` True Blue.'' This new entry might just have a chance, provided <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> dumps the show's emergency disco beat, and the nine other episodes filmed so far have made a valiant effort to avoid TV cop cliches. The cast is good. Let us pray future scripts are, too.

<HEAD>Are Price-Earnings Ratios A Guide?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The ratio of price to earnings long has been one of the most popular measurements of value in the stock market, so well known that it is published each business day in many newspapers. It is easily comprehended, being nothing more than the multiple of per-share earnings that buyers are willing to pay for a company's stock. Example: Earnings of $ 2 a share, price $ 24, equals P-E of 12. This very simplicity, however, provokes critics into warnings that it is too simplistic, too dated and too variable to provide fully reliable information. Simplistic? To measure value by P-E alone may mean ignoring management changes or developing problems. Dated? It measures past performance, not that of the future. Variable? P-Es bounce all over the lot. This latter criticism is becoming one of the paramount considerations these days, one that is perhaps as difficult to fathom as any in the marketplace. The reason: The level of P-Es varies enormously, depending on myriad factors. If these factors were strictly financial, perhaps they could be understood. But they include mass psychology, cultural change, relations between nations, threats of war, investment money available, world confidence and on and on. As a result, the market's average P-E can vary sharply from year to year, from one industry to another, from country to country. While you might be able to tell if one company's P-E is out of line with the market as a whole, how do you know that the market's average P-E also is n't out of whack At the end of October, according to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dessauer </PERSON>, an independent analyst who follows stocks throughout the world, P-Es in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> were 11.8, in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> 13.7 and in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> 50.1. Which is too high, which too low? What are the factors _ cultural, economic, psychological _ that justify such differences? And what do you make of <PERSON> Dessauer </PERSON>'s finding that at the end of 1982, when the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic expansion began, comparable ratios were 10.8 in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, 10.1 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 22.2 in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>? <PERSON> Dessauer </PERSON>, publisher of <PERSON> Dessauer </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, traced average P-Es in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for several decades and found variability that many would consider surprising. A general trend toward higher P-Es developed through the 1950s and 1960s. In 1950, investors paid on average only seven times earnings for the stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average. By 1959 the average had risen to 18.4 times earnings and it peaked in 1961 at 21.7 times. The trend went into reverse in the 1970s. Perhaps because of rising oil prices, double-digit inflation and growing budget deficits, investors lowered the prices they were willing to pay for stocks. By 1979 the Dow's P-E ratio was down all the way to 6.8. From that extreme low, the Dow's P-E began rising again in the 1980s _ until the great crash of October 1987. Recently it stood at 11.3, down from a 1987 average of 15.8. What does the future hold? To even attempt answering that you would have to consider the possibilities for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy, the consequences of the Cold War ending, the contributions that will be made by changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the growth rate of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economy, the amount of investment money available That might be a beginning; the end could never be sighted. The amount of research necessary, to say nothing of its quality, would consume so much time that it could n't keep pace with changes, including those in the average P-E. Opinions are always possible, however, and <PERSON> Dessauer </PERSON> believes `` the overwhelming need to invest huge amounts of surplus capital can be expected to overcome stock market jitters.'' He believes the trend will gather momentum and become self-reinforcing. His forecast: `` Look for world stock markets, pushed by the forces of a huge global savings pool, to be generally strong in 1990 and into 1991.''

 Students at pricey universities like Notre Dame, <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> are dishing up meals in soup kitchens, counseling abused children and helping the homeless in a domestic version of the Peace Corps. The work helps defray tuition that can exceed $ 10,000 a year, but for the students _ many of them more accustomed to spending summers by the lake than on the soup line _ the volunteerism offers extra education. `` I think for some of our students, those who have grown up in wealthy suburbs, it brings them into contact with a segment of society they've never encountered,'' said Notre Dame spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conklin </PERSON>. `` Enough of them have come back and given witness to the fact that it was a lasting experience,'' <PERSON> Conklin </PERSON> said. `` It caused reflection that really changed their attitudes, especially a wider recognition of the less fortunate.'' <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> recently announced a program to give students $ 2,000 stipends for taking community service jobs across the country each summer. A similar program began last summer at <LOCATION> Stanford </LOCATION>, offering $ 1,300. Both are based on the <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Summer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scholars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, which gives about 24 <ORGANIZATION> Notre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dame </ORGANIZATION> students $ 1,400 each in tuition money to pursue public service projects. <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION>'s tuition is $ 13,569 a year, <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>'s is $ 14,000 and Notre Dame's is $ 11,315. While tuition stipends may be recent, campus volunteerism certainly is n't. `` We've got a tradition here of volunteering,'' <PERSON> Conklin </PERSON> said. `` About two-thirds of Notre Dame students engage in volunteer services and about one in 10 devotes a year of social service upon graduation.'' More than half of <ORGANIZATION> DePauw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s 2,400 students in <LOCATION> Greencastle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, participate in public service projects, including overseas missionary work and visiting prison inmates. At <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>, more than 2,000 students a year donate time, as did 70 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION>'s graduating seniors last year. `` I do hope it does change the image of college students of today as not just party-goers,'' said <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> of Notre Dame's Center for Social Concerns, which oversees the Andrews program in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. The 9-year-old program was begun as a memorial to <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, an alumnus and co-owner of <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Syndicate </ORGANIZATION>. It is financed with contributions from the syndicate's talent, including `` Doonesbury'' cartoonist <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON> and advice columnist <PERSON> Abigail </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Buren </PERSON>. The fund is worth more than $ 350,000, according to <PERSON> Conklin </PERSON>, who said he knows of no universities other than <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> with similar programs. Last summer, 94 <ORGANIZATION> Notre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dame </ORGANIZATION> students participated in public service projects and 34 were given stipends through Andrews scholarships. Despite the assurance of a paycheck at the end of the summer, the big payoff is often emotional. In the fall, the <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> recipients gather to share stories about their summer of social work. `` There's not a dry eye in the house after that dinner. The stories, however brief, are very poignant,'' said <PERSON> Conklin </PERSON>, whose daughter, <PERSON> Christina </PERSON>, spent a summer working in a home for abused children in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. `` I remember my daughter saying she learned not to ask these children where they were from because most of them did not have a home.

<TEXT>
 The future of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s decade of market-oriented economic reforms, under which <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economy staged a remarkable recovery after the ruinous 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, is particularly murky. `` To get rich is glorious'' was the phrase that moved the masses in the 1980s, but it has fallen out of favor with the ascendancy this year of ideological hard-liners. If conservatives such as Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> win the power struggle, the open-door policy would slow and more emphasis would be placed on central planning, which would be bitterly opposed by coastal regions that prospered greatly during <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s reforms. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s uncertain future was summed up recently by <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador to <PERSON> Beijing </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON>, who said: `` It may be some years before we can put a name or theme to the new chapter <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will write in the 1990s. In the meantime, we must be prepared for twists and turns that may defy attempts'' at labeling. A crisis also could occur in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, a fledgling democracy where President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has said she will not seek re-election when her term expires in 1992. No strong candidate has emerged as her heir apparent on the politically fractured archipelago. <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yew </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamad </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON> are strong leaders who also may leave the scene in the coming years. `` Every leader but one will change'' in the region, said <PERSON> Broadfoot </PERSON>. He expects only the Sultan of <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION> to still be in power at the turn of the century. One territory that is almost assured of a rough decade is <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will hand over to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1997. Fewer and fewer of the colony's 5.7 million people have faith in Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s promise that <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> can maintain its capitalist lifestyle for 50 years and enjoy a `` high degree of autonomy,'' particularly since the suppression of the pro-democracy movement in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Huge numbers of people uncertain about the future are emigrating from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. A foreign passport is the most prized possession in the colony, and residents are sparing no effort to secure one. Marriage counselors report booming business from people desperately seeking foreign national spouses. The government, in estimates often criticized as too conservative, believes 42,000 people will emigrate in 1989 and another 55,000 will leave the following year. Many highly educated white-collar workers are among those leaving, leading to a brain drain that could reduce the territory's economic competitiveness Adding to the territory's headache are the approximately 57,000 Vietnamese boat people who have sailed to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> seeking asylum. The squalid camps in which they are housed could erupt in violence if the government carries through plans to send most of them back to their homeland against their will. Two of the other `` little dragons'' _ <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> _ show promise for furthering what <PERSON> Mushkat </PERSON> calls `` the slow and painful process'' of democratic change in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, which has a long history of authoritarian rule. For example, the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is slowly giving up its monopoly on political power in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. `` Democratization shall not move backward in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> unless the economy collapses or in case of a war, neither of which looks very likely,'' said <PERSON> Lu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ya-li </PERSON>, a political commentator at <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taiwan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. But <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> may experience some social instability because of a problem also faced by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> _ a population that has not seen its standard of living increase as quickly as national wealth. Property prices have skyrocketed in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, and most middle-class families have lost all chance of buying their own homes. Crime has increased to the point where sales of luxury foreign cars have fallen sharply because businessmen say the vehicles make them targets of blackmail. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the average person lives in cramped housing, suffers a long commute through congested traffic and pays prices 20 percent to 30 percent higher than in other industrial nations. Says <PERSON> Broadfoot </PERSON>: `` You'll see a much greater emphasis on quality of life in <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'' during the 1990s. In <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, the 1990s will begin with a number of thorny security issues, including the Cambodian civil war in which the genocidal <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> is among several groups fighting for power. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will be negotiating the future of six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases on the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> whose lease expires in 1991. Many influential politicians oppose the bases, and there has been some indication of growing sentiment in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>' armed forces against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities. But perhaps the most interesting security question will be what <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> does to protect its growing economic interests in the region. <PERSON> Broadfoot </PERSON> sees <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> likely flexing greater military strength. `` I do n't think the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be able to continue to be the defense umbrella of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> to the extent that it has been,'' he said. A stronger Japanese military will undoubtedly rekindle painful memories throughout the region of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s efforts to carve a subservient <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> Co-Prosperity Sphere during the World War II era. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> may choose to protect its investment through the use of foreign aid designed to promote stability in the region, but that could help create a zone of influence that also could lead to anti-Japanese sentiment.

<HEAD>Mitsubishi Montero: As Much Beauty as Beast</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto, LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 It's tall, boxy, big and truck-like, but in its own way, the 1990 <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> Montero 4-Door RS is as much beauty as beast. True, there's no refined leather interior or woodgrain trim, but there is lumbering V-6 power and decent handling to impress. There are no comfort-making, front-seat middle armrests, the steering wheel is large and truckish, and the <PERSON> Montero </PERSON>'s radio is a bit of a reach at the bottom of the center dashboard console. But the Montero does offer lots of legroom and headroom, thanks to its unusually tall profile, and it climbs inclines with gusto. In sum, the <LOCATION> Montero </LOCATION> is a substantial, serious vehicle with a rugged character. It's not a dressed-up pretty face on the road. That did n't stop Motor Trend magazine from naming the 1989 Montero 4-Door the top buy among sport utility vehicles. The vehicle returns for 1990 virtually unchanged mechanically and in design. Among the key attributes of the Montero that Motor Trend noted was its interior space: at 94.9 cubic feet of cargo capacity with the rear seat folded, it's the largest of its class. The magazine was n't exaggerating. The room inside the test vehicle was something to behold. Three adults were comfortable in the bench back seat, and legroom there was admirable, thanks to the high perch of the back seat that meant legs were extended mostly downward, rather than horizontally. Way back in the cargo area, I could even sit straight up on the carpeted floor with my back against the rear seat and conveniently fit my legs inside. The 43.4 cubic feet left plenty of room for tailgating, and as mentioned, it could be enlarged to 94.9 cubic feet if the rear seat was folded. The rear gate swung open sideways, not pulling downward. Even on a slight slope, the gate opened easily and held _ not swinging back on me. Of course, I did have a big step up to get inside because of its high ground clearance for off-roading. There also was good passenger visibility, thanks to the high seating perch in the 74.4-inch-high Montero, which is taller than competitors <ORGANIZATION> Isuzu </ORGANIZATION> Trooper and Jeep Cherokee. Inside the Montero, handles seemed to be about everywhere, especially for rear-seat passengers. They could grab either of two handles by the rear doors to help them scramble up, or they could use the cut-out-style headrests on the front seats to help them get situated inside. The <PERSON> Montero </PERSON> also had a unique inclinometer in the middle of the dashboard. It was an encased blue and black ball that rolled in its case with the movement of the vehicle. When the ball went nearly black, I knew the vehicle was in a dangerously inclined position. But do n't try to watch the ball as you drive, or you may wind up off the road as I did. <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> notes that the inclinometer's indicator should be checked when the vehicle is at a standstill Still, just its moving presence on the dash served as a reminder that the Montero, like all sport utility vehicles, has a different center of gravity than cars do and must be driven with care. The test vehicle went from two-wheel - to four-wheel-drive and back again with the help of automatic free hubs They automatically locked or unlocked the front wheels according to the setting on the transfer shift lever inside, next to the regular transmission gear shifter. The two-door <PERSON> Montero </PERSON> has been sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since February 1984, but the four-door model did n't arrive until August 1988. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stearn </PERSON> said the four-door was needed as more Americans began using sport utilities as station wagons and for rural and off-road trips for families. Sales of Monteros grew from 2,348 in 1984 to 10,924 in 1987, then fell to 8,521 in 1988. But in the first 10 months of this year, sales were up again, from 5,903 in the January-October period in 1988 to 9,792. <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> says the four-door <LOCATION> Montero </LOCATION> buyer is typically male -LRB- 74 percent -RRB- and married -LRB- 88 percent -RRB-. But studies show it's not unusual for their wives to drive the Montero more than they do. Median age of the male buyer is 39, and 66 percent are college graduates, the company says. Average family income is $ 75,500, and 40 percent are in professional and technical jobs. An additional 15 percent are managers. The Montero is not at the bottom of the sport utility field, pricewise. Starting price for a four-door with V-6 engine and manual transmission is $ 15,519, compared with $ 14,249 for an Isuzu Trooper -LRB- trim levels may differ slightly, too -RRB-. The test vehicle, a middle range RS model with four-speed automatic transmission and options, topped out at more than $ 21,000. Consumer Reports magazine did not list an owner trouble record for the <LOCATION> Montero </LOCATION>.

 Nine years after the AIDS epidemic began, a sluggish <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government is quickening its response. Perhaps the most visible sign is the relatively rapid approval given to new AIDS drugs this year. One reason for this is the grass-roots activism prodding the government to change the way it does business.

 <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>'s sunlit, book-lined apartment overlooks leafy <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, the heart of <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>. Inside are two desks: one for <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> the writer, another for <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> the activist. The second desk, covered with scientific reports, news clippings and government memorandums, is where <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> plots his battles against drug companies and the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, urging them to move faster to combat AIDS. <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> is a playwright, novelist and journalist and the founder of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, or ACT UP, a highly visible advocacy group. Through ACT UP, he has staged angry demonstrations like one that delayed the opening of the <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on AIDS in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> last June. <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> also writes fiercely eloquent newspaper columns inciting AIDS patients to fight for better care and attacking the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s delays in approving new drugs `` I do n't think anyone can understand what it's like being a gay man in a big city,'' <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> said in an interview. `` It's like wartime. ... I'm fighting for lives, and I'm fighting for my own life.'' <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> lost his lover to AIDS in 1984 and is himself infected with the virus, although he is n't visibly ill. <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> and his allies have become well-known for shouting and picketing They are less known for their behind-the-scenes pursuit of reforms. For two years, they have studied the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>, learning its rules and probing its secrets with the Freedom of Information Act. Now they are beginning to change it. `` Before we just protested,'' <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> said. `` Now we have plans.'' After years of blind anger, <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> and like-minded activists across the country have become adept at persuading the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> and the pharmaceutical industry to respond to their concerns. `` The needs of the patient community are the most extreme and desperate,'' <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> said. `` The laws that bind the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> are the most extreme and inhumanely lengthy.'' As of the end of October, the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> had reports of 112,241 cases of AIDS and 66,493 deaths. With such a toll, `` you simply ca n't do business-as-usual studies that take 10 years,'' <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> said. Thousands more will die unless the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s protection-at-all-costs system for investigating new drugs is changed and potentially life-saving treatments are more rapidly approved, <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> asserts. And even those who can obtain experimental drugs may find they ca n't afford them: health insurance covers only drugs approved by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>. Activists argue that desperate patients should have the right to choose what drugs to try. `` I think right now we are seeing a major shift in the federal health establishment, from attempting to protect people to realizing there are circumstances under which people should be allowed to take risks,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Eigo </PERSON> of ACT UP's treatment and data committee. Several recent events highlight the change in attitude at the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>. In June, Dr. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON>, head of the federal AIDS research effort, announced he would push for an experimental system under which the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> would continue controlled studies of promising new drugs but also make the drugs more widely available to patients who can not get into the experimental trials. This is now referred to as the `` parallel track'' approach. `` Parallel track was our idea two years ago,'' said <PERSON> Eigo </PERSON>. He is now a member of a federal committee appointed to oversee the new process. In July, federal health officials met with AIDS activists to discuss how government research might benefit from underground drug trials organized by the activists. The meeting was a high point in cooperation between the activists and government. `` This is like a dream,'' Dr. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said last summer. `` I do n't think any of us could have envisioned it.'' In September, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> made an experimental drug widely available to patients, even though parallel tracking had not been formally established. The drug, called dideoxyinosine or ddI, is still under study to determine whether it offers advantages over AZT, the only approved anti-AIDS drug in this country. At the same time, however, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> is allowing drugmaker Bristol-Myers to dispense it to patients with advanced AIDS or AIDS-related complex who can not tolerate AZT. Some scientists worry that wide distribution of drugs will interfere with experimental trials because patients know that in controlled trials they might get placebos rather than drug doses. Federal officials say it is too soon to know how serious the potential problem is. Even with release of ddI, however, activists have not eased up, continuing their pressure on American drug companies by threatening to buy drugs overseas if they ca n't get them in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. If Bristol-Myers had not made ddI available, for example, activists could have bought it from underground labs, <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> said. The company was `` about to lose a big market if they did n't get the drug out,'' he said. Activists in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and other cities have established `` buying groups'' that travel to other countries where AIDS drugs banned in this country are freely available or less expensive. In one important case, activists protested the high cost of a drug called pentamidine, used to prevent and treat pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, one of the deadliest of AIDS-related infections. They threatened to buy the drug in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, where a monthly dose can be bought for less than half of the $ 99.54 wholesale price charged by its American maker, <ORGANIZATION> Lyphomed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Rosemone </LOCATION>, Ill. The company compromised, insisting on keeping its wholesale price but agreeing to provide the drug free to uninsured AIDS patients.

<HEAD>Cold and Snowy Gray Skies Set Mood for Soviet Winter of Discontent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As snow begins to fall and the sky turns gray, Soviet citizens enter a long winter of discontent over barren store shelves, strikes and ethnic clashes that, far from being halted by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms, often have worsened. `` There's much that we'd like to have, but the Russian people are used to difficulties,'' said <PERSON> Luda </PERSON> <PERSON> Panina </PERSON>, 33, as she sold red carnations outside a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> subway station on a cold, snowy day. Russians _ and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s more than 100 other national groups _ have endured hardships for decades, but the difference is that now they expect more, both from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and from his perestroika program that 4 -LCB- years ago promised to make their lives better. Preparing for his shipboard summit with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> this weekend, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> indicated a principal goal of the talks would be to discuss easing of international tensions so that he could focus more on problems at home. `` To put it in a nutshell, we need a normal external environment for our domestic work,'' he said. The country has been torn by long-simmering ethnic, economic and environmental woes that the leadership previously ignored or stifled, but which have surfaced as `` glasnost,'' or openness, exposes harsh realities. Inflation, crime and budget deficits, around for decades, were hushed up until glasnost brought out the shocking numbers: crime up 34 percent in the first 10 months of 1989 over the same period last year, a budget deficit reaching 120 billion rubles -LRB- $ 194 billion -RRB-, inflation pegged by one economist at 4 percent to 5 percent yearly. Ethnic tensions among the myriad Soviet peoples _ many of whom were brutally oppressed under dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> _ have pitted Armenians against <PERSON> Azerbaijanis </PERSON>, ethnic Turks against Uzbeks and Russian minorities against Estonians, Latvians, Lithuanians, Ukrainians and Moldavians. Ethnic clashes have taken more than 300 lives, by official count. In addition, growing campaigns for independence in many of the 15 constituent Soviet republics, especially in the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION>, are threatening the very glue that holds the union together. Strikes by coal miners, angry about official inattention to their hazardous work conditions and poor lifestyles, have depleted fuel supplies going into the winter. In the southern republic of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, the government ordered businesses to switch days off to Wednesdays and Thursdays because of an electricity shortage, caused in part by the shutdown of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s nuclear power plant after last year's devastating earthquake. Outright economic sabotage is afoot as well. <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> blockaded the ethnic hotspot of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> for two months, preventing trainloads of fuel, food and raw materials from getting through. The blockade delayed reconstruction of the area leveled by the Dec. 7, 1988, earthquake that killed 25,000 Armenians. Officials now say rebuilding will take three years, one more than planned. Other headaches the nation and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> have suffered include the 1986 <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear power plant explosion and fire that, according to one Soviet newspaper, led to the deaths of 250 people and cost billions of rubles, a gas pipeline blast in June that killed more than 600 passengers on passing trains, and extensive water and air pollution. To many Soviets, however, their mood depends largely on what there is to eat and wear. For the most part, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms have brought not improvements in Soviets' standard of living, but more of what people here call `` deficits,'' shortages of products that have led to the widespread rationing of butter, cheese, meat, sugar and tea. Some economists even propose rationing everything, to prevent the hoarding that is now common. As Soviets approach the end of the year, many would agree with a prediction made months ago. `` One can expect that the year 1989 will be the most unsuccessful of all those we have lived through,'' <PERSON> Vasily </PERSON> <PERSON> Selyunin </PERSON>, a specialist in economic affairs, wrote in April. Statistics tell the 287 million Soviets what they already know from painful experience: _ Of 211 food products, a consumer demand institute found only 23 could be bought freely The rest require connections with the sellers or overpayment or they are rationed. _ Soviets eat half the meat and fruit consumed by the average American, but twice as many potatoes _ Because of losses in distribution and processing, one-quarter of all farm products do n't reach consumers _ Nearly 80 percent of Muscovites buy up items in short supply, even though they do n't really need them at the time, and there is unsatisfied consumer demand in the capital worth the equivalent of $ 14 million to $ 16 billion, a research institute estimates <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> now speaks openly about the failures of perestroika and has increasingly expressed worry over the people's mood. `` The shortage of food creates social tension and generates not merely criticism but actual discontent,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in March. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Maslyukov </PERSON>, the state planning chief, also has spoken of `` mounting social discontent.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his aides admit they failed initially to pay enough attention to the people's welfare and say improving it is now their No. 1 priority. `` All of our productive capacity must be reoriented to produce what the people need: consumer goods,'' the Soviet leader said in May. To that end, some 300 military factories are being converted to civilian production and the 1990 government budget calls for increasing consumer goods output by 12 percent. The Kremlin also is turning to other countries for quick fixes. It plans to use its precious reserves of foreign currency and Western credits to import $ 51.8 billion worth of consumer goods next year. To help Soviet industry gear up to produce such goods on its own, plans call for importing $ 2.6 billion worth of raw materials and light industry equipment. This year, the government brought in 15 million pair of leather shoes, 12 million pair of warm women's boots, 300 million razor blades, 10 million compact cassette players, as well as clothing, soap, detergent and toothpaste. Contracts were signed with foreign companies from <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. An encounter with Ms. <PERSON> Panina </PERSON>, the flower saleswoman, showed the imports are reaching the people. Two large boxes of Danish laundry detergent she had bought sat on the ground next to her flower stand. American-brand toothpaste also has appeared in some <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> stores. But the Kremlin can not afford such costly imports for long, and Western officials say they will not help solve the basic problem: inadequacy of domestic production. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid `` might take the pressures off for a few months,'' one senior Western diplomat said, but later `` the shelves would still be bare.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said the `` socio-economic situation'' must be righted within a year and a half at most, but one of his chief economic advisers, <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aganbegyan </PERSON>, says it will take twice that long to end shortages. Politburo member <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> estimates it will take until 1996 to bring Soviets' diet up to nutritional norms. In the meantime, Soviets keep scrounging around. `` You must run around to stores to buy what you need,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Panina </PERSON>. A look of wonderment on her face, she added, `` They say in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> you go to one store and buy all you want.''

<HEAD>Senators United Against White House Bid To Control Judgeships</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a display of bipartisanship with a vengeance, <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senators are feuding with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> over the senatorial prerogative of saying who should be appointed a federal judge back home. The administration is trying to enforce a multiple choice system instead of letting <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senators pick names for almost automatic nomination to federal district judgeships. That has angered Republicans, gained them <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> allies, and set the lines for a confrontation after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> reconvenes on Jan. 23 unless the dispute can be settled first. `` It is said that marriages are made in heaven, but judgeships are made in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senator declared, applauding a Republican colleague for challenging the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on the matter. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said Wednesday that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` wants a pool of suitable candidates from which he can choose his nominee,'' and govern the process himself. He said if senators wo n't accept those terms, `` that's a matter between them and the president.'' On this one the lines are institutional, not political. Senators do n't have much in the way of patronage, and they are not about to let go of the judgeships on which they have claimed selection rights for 150 years and more. The case at issue involves the appointment of a federal district court judge for <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>, R-Vt., has been trying all year to get <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> of Weybridge nominated to fill the vacancy The dispute erupted into debate just before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourned 10 days ago. Because of it, <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> held up the confirmation of federal judges in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, and said he will block nominations wholesale next year if necessary. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican Conference sided with him, and told President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that he ought to nominate <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>' choice. <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> said district court judgeships have been the prerogative of senators since 1840, a tradition so strong that President <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> once nominated a man he did n't want because a senator insisted, and then sent administration aides to lobby, unsuccessfully, against confirmation. That tradition has been whittled a bit during the past two administrations. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> had selection panels look at all nominees, and required that there be more women and minority nominees. While he bent the old system, he did not break it. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had a review commission, and his administration required that senators send the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> three names for each vacancy instead of just one. But Republican senators left no doubt about which name counted, and they got their way. <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> changes did n't really interfere with <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> prerogatives. `` What formerly was a formality is now a reality,'' <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> said. `` It is the policy of this administration that any senator must send at least three names, and it also has been made clear to me personally that they are not restricted to those names to select from.'' Bending to the administration, <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> did supply two more names, but made clear that <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s was the only one acceptable to him <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> said the names go to `` a review panel of five bureaucrats somewhere in the bowels of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` If they, as in my case, decide that that candidate is unacceptable, that is the end of the process,'' he said. That's why he decided to fight, using another <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> prerogative to block other nominees. In <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> said, a nine-member, bipartisan panel reviews candidates for the federal bench. He said <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> was rated the best of a dozen potential nominees, far ahead of any other, and he insisted the state selection board is better equipped than the administration to choose the best judge for <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> that if he yields on <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, every other senator will be at risk when it comes time to fill a federal court vacancy. Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., agreed with <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> on the system and on the selection of <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, whom he called the best possible choice He said judgeships should continue to be made in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Del. chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said there's more at stake than an ancient prerogative. `` Unlike five bureaucrats in the White House subjecting nominees to litmus tests or any other tests, the home state senators know better the quality of the people in their states,'' <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> freshman, has ventured no public guess as to why the administration is making his choice a test case. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, who practices law in <LOCATION> Middlebury </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, was an assistant attorney general when <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> served as state attorney general. <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickman </PERSON>, an aide to <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, has cited <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s membership in the all-male <PERSON> Ethan </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Club </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> resigned from the club before his name was recommended for the bench. <PERSON> Dickman </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> once complained to <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> about the membership of another judicial nominee in an all-male club. The nomination of <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> was held up for nearly two years, and finally approved this month. There's not much political logic there. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> also was sponsored by a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senator, and two <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> administrations stuck with him, Democratic opposition and club affiliations notwithstanding.

<HEAD>Congress on Verge of Passing Landmark Handicapped Rights Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is on the threshold of enacting one of the most far-reaching pieces of civil rights legislation ever, addressing one of the nation's largest and disparate minorities: the disabled. The Americans With Disabilities Act guarantees the nation's 43 million deaf, blind, lame and otherwise infirm people against job discrimination, assuring them access to transportation as well as shopping malls, doctors' offices, restaurants, movies and other public accommodations. An entire section guarantees the nation's 24 million hearing-impaired and 3 million speech-impaired residents access to telephone service. The legislation also says the 1.5 million Americans infected with the AIDS virus can be treated no differently from anyone with any other illness or disability, such as multiple sclerosis or cancer. `` This is one of the best steps forward that we can take to fight the AIDS epidemic,'' Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., told fellow senators Further, the bill declares that alcoholism and drug addiction are medical problems rather than signs of moral turpitude, protecting people who are trying to overcome their addictions. The bill also extends new protections to those suffering from mental illness, mental retardation and learning disabilities. Opposition has come primarily from small business groups worried about the cost and complication of compliance and from a small but vocal group of lawmakers opposed to new legal protection for AIDS victims. House debate is likely to be heated over the AIDS provisions and the question of precisely how much protection the bill affords victims of the disease. But with more than 200 sponsors in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the support of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and backing from more than 200 civil rights and other advocacy groups, the overall bill is likely to pass substantially unchanged. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed the measure 76-8 on Sept. 7, and four House committees are going through its provisions before a floor vote likely to send the bill to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his signature. In <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate, proponents likened it to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited racial or religious discrimination. Some turned the clock back further: to the freeing of the slaves. Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>, one of the measure's chief sponsors, calls it a `` 20th century Emancipation Proclamation for people with disabilities.'' Business groups, however, remain skeptical. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> claims its 570,000 members, mainly small business owners, will bear the largest burden with nothing offered in return. The federation and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> also complain that the legislation is so vague that the only ones guaranteed employment will be lawyers. Lawyers following up on the bill's provisions could `` achieve results from courts that perhaps are not in accordance with the manner in which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended the statute,'' says chamber attorney <PERSON> Zachary </PERSON> <PERSON> Fasman </PERSON>. No one has come up with a private-sector price tag. Supporters talk instead about the economic benefits of putting the disabled into the economic mainstream. They say the bill will lead to fewer government support payments, more consumers and more taxpayers. The numbers: 8.2 million disabled Americans who wanted to work were unemployed in 1986, and half had household incomes of $ 15,000 or less. Transfer payments to the disabled are reaching nearly $ 60 billion a year. Institutionalization costs $ 200 a day per patient. Behind those numbers lie tales of suffering and humiliation: _ The foster mother of a deceased AIDS victim in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> who went to more than two dozen funeral homes before finding one that would prepare the body The <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> woman who was dismissed from a job because her AIDS-stricken son moved back home. _ The blind <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> graduate who wrote to 600 corporations three times over without receiving a single job offer _ The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> zookeeper who kept children with Downs syndrome away from the primate cage for fear they might upset the chimps _ The college that refused to hire a severely arthritic woman because trustees thought `` normal students should n't see her. _ The paralyzed <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran who must use the service entrance to restaurants because the regular doorways are too narrow for his wheelchair _ The paraplegic who ca n't go out on the spur of the moment with non-disabled friends because the transit bus lacks a wheelchair lift and the special van must be scheduled a day in advance _ The rural, elderly person who ca n't afford an airline ticket but ca n't ride a less expensive bus because it has no lift _ Or, in one of the frequent cases of `` benign'' discrimination, the blind person who wants to wait his turn in line at the National Aquarium but is told he must use the handicapped entrance If the bill's spirit recalls the Emancipation Proclamation, its letter comes out of the word processors of the federal bureaucracy. The legislation borrows from the 1964 civil rights act and sections of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 dealing with companies, institutions and groups that receive government money. Rather than list specific disabilities _ estimated by some to be about 900 _ the law defines disability as `` a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities.'' Disabled individuals must be hired if they are qualified to do the `` essential functions'' of a job. Still, exceptions _ likely fodder for future legal tests _ abound. The disabled need not be hired if that poses `` an undue hardship.'' Existing public accommodations must be made accessible as long as the changes are `` readily achievable'' without creating an `` undue financial burden.'' Debate has focused on the cost and extent of accommodations, with supporters arguing that most will involve relatively little expense. Widening a door might cost $ 300. Relay services for the deaf and speech-impaired would add about $ 1.20 a year to each customer's telephone bill. But Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, argues that the annual cost of a sign-language interpreter can reach $ 23,500. A reader would have to be hired for a blind executive or accountant, forcing employers to hire two people for one job. Computers with speech synthesizers and special software for the blind can easily cost $ 5,000, he says. The bus industry estimates the cost of lifts at $ 35,000 each, not to mention the lost seats and lost cargo space for package express. Proponents say new, state-of-the-art models are now available for $ 11,000. Sen. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, says he is troubled by the lack of discretion allowed employers when dealing with an addict, even if that person is now `` clean.'' `` It is difficult for a person to develop an addiction to illegal drugs without first making a conscious decision to break the law,'' <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON> says.

 The prospect of outfitting public buses to accept wheelchairs, as the pending Americans With Disabilities Act would require, troubles many transit officials. They say wheelchair lifts are expensive, unreliable and a nuisance to `` normal'' riders. But in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> system started putting lifts on buses 10 years ago and now has them on 75 percent of its 1,000-bus fleet, it's hard to see what all the fuss is about. This city is a leader in making its bus system accessible to lame, deaf, blind and mentally disabled riders. It even gets fan mail: a wheelchair-bound couple from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> recently wrote to say they honeymooned in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> because they knew they'd be able to get around. `` The difference here was that we planned it to succeed rather than to fail,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>. `` The attitude in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> has been that accessibility is worth the cost.'' The cost to the system is high _ $ 3.89 per trip for wheelchair passengers, compared to $ 2 per regular ride. Taxpayers bear the brunt of it; disabled riders pay just 25 cents per trip, less than half the lowest regular fare of 55 cents. But <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> thinks the price is reasonable. Paralyzed from the waist down by a diving accident 15 years ago, he says the city's wheelchair lifts have opened doors once closed to him and other disabled residents `` It's being told, ` You're part of the system,' versus, ` You're a pain in the neck,''' <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said one recent afternoon as he waited at a downtown bus stop A bus soon eased to a halt, and other passengers hurried on. Seeing <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>'s wheelchair, the driver pushed a button. With the whine of an electric motor, a metal platform slid out from under the front steps. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> rolled onto the hydraulic lift, which then rose up and over the steps, settling on the floor inside. As the lift reversed itself and slid back out of sight, <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> wheeled down the aisle and, with the driver's help, strapped his wheelchair into a reserved space. The driver was courteous. Some passengers on the crowded bus had to pull their feet back to let <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> pass, but nobody grumbled, and the whole operation took 45 seconds. When <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> started its program, critics held up the failures of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, which had been plagued by lifts malfunctioning up to 70 percent of the time, uncooperative bus drivers and disabled people afraid to use the system. `` I was told the -LRB- bus drivers' -RRB- union would fight it,'' said <PERSON> B.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON>, who started <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION>'s program in 1978 and now is a private transportation consultant. `` I was told there would be a huge backlash from non-disabled persons refusing to ride with disabled passengers.'' <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> headed off problems by aggressively marketing its new program. Lift-equipped buses visited nursing homes for practice sessions. Officials asked riders for advice and followed it. They augmented wheelchair-accessible buses with `` para-transit'' vans available on a reservation basis for people too disabled to use buses. Perhaps most importantly, they maintained their equipment. Nationwide, wheelchair lifts break down an average 10 percent of the time, an unacceptable rate for riders depending on the bus to get to work, <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>'s malfunction rate hovers around 1 percent, he said. Even here, disabled passengers are still a tiny minority. They account for about 380 rides a day _ less than 1 percent of the system's total ridership. `` It would be more cost-effective to tell them, ` Go jump in the lake, we're not going to serve you at all,''' said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON>. But that, too, would have a price: `` You can support disabled people in a warehouse situation, or you can get them in the mainstream, with a job, paying taxes,'' <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> said. `` Overall, it's cost-effective to let people work, because that's what they want to do.

<HEAD>Bombs Have Always Worked, But Testing Continues At Nevada Site</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM DAHLBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MERCURY, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For 38 years, the government has exploded nuclear weapons at the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Test Site. Bombs have been dropped from airplanes and exploded atop tall towers. They've been buried deep underground and in tunnels. At least one was launched with an air-to-air rocket. In every one of 697 announced tests, there's been one constant. `` They've always gone off,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> office at <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livermore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>. `` Sometimes the yields have n't been what we expected, but they've always gone off.'' Given that nearly perfect track record, why does the government continue spending some $ 500 million a year to test its nuclear weapons? `` Reliability is one reason, but it's only one,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` We see a need to modernize our weapons in response to a changing world. And there's a tremendously significant need to improve the safety of our current weapons.'' That view is challenged by a senior physicist at <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Livermore </LOCATION>, where nuclear weapons are designed. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON>, a 30-year veteran of nuclear weapons research, says current weapons are both safe and reliable and contends the only reason for continued testing is to develop new warheads, such as one under development that would burrow underground before exploding. `` Do you want new weapons or not? That is really the only question,'' said <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON>, who in a 1987 report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> refuted the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's contention it needed to test weapons from stockpiles to ensure they worked. <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON>'s five-month study found the nuclear stockpile to be robust, and argued that weapons no longer had to be taken off the shelf to be tested. `` With the exception of a few of the management people in the complex here, I think almost everyone agrees with that now,'' he said. `` Almost anybody that does n't have an institutional reason for it pretty much agrees you can maintain a stockpile for deterrence forever without new testing.'' Nuclear weapons have a shelf life of only about 20 years before they start deteriorating, but <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON> argued in his study that scientists would be able to manufacture new ones based on old designs without the need for new testing. `` I think he underestimates the difficulty of remanufacturing these weapons,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` We've tried to remanufacture things and there have been problems that surprised us at the time,'' because of changes in materials and the difficulty of following the old old designs. Older weapons are still being tested but much of the current program involves new ones, he said. `` There are new systems being developed at the request of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ... `` Right now we're working on a short-range attack missile with advanced security features that will help penetrate air defenses.'' Without testing, he said, designers would n't have the confidence to make new warheads for new weapons. `` An example is the air-launched cruise missiles, which needed a new warhead. We did a test in the 1980s at low temperatures that failed to meet expectations and we had to make a correction.'' Scientists no longer carry on the breakneck testing schedule that, at one point, saw an average two detonations a week in 1962. An evolving knowledge of nuclear science has seen testing schedules reduced to an average of little more than one explosion a month in the last decade. Since <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> testing began with the detonation of the first atomic bomb, a 15-kiloton blast in July 1945 at <LOCATION> Alamogordo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, 825 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear weapons have been detonated, 697 of those since testing was moved to its current location. `` It's not just blowing up a bomb in the bottom of the desert,'' said <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquilina </PERSON>, who runs the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear testing program. `` This is a completely new science. It's only been since 1945 that we've been doing this.'' Several tests in the last few years were `` Star Wars'' - related, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said, and perhaps incongruously, some are to see how the nation's weapons program can operate if there were a U.S.-Soviet agreement limiting the size of explosions `` A fairly significant part of our program is devoted to how we can accomplish our mission under further test limitations,'' he said. `` We're trying to determine what we might be able to accomplish at lower thresholds.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year asked federal agencies and laboratories to study how a test ban treaty with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would affect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear capabilities. `` The government's position is that it is taking a stepwise approach to a ban,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` We're doing the research aimed at developing the technical base for the government to make its decisions.'' Current nuclear tests are restricted to no more than 150 kilotons, the explosive equivalent of 150,000 tons of TNT. The limit was set in a 1974 treaty never ratified by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agreed to a test ban in November 1958 that ended in September 1961 with the Soviets' decision to resume testing. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is on record as wanting to agree to lower limits before it will negotiate a test ban, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. The two nations made history last year when nuclear scientists from each witnessed a test at the other's secret site. Soviet scientists witnessed a test at the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> site in August 1988; American scientists went to the Soviet site at <LOCATION> Semipalatinsk </LOCATION> the following month. The tests were aimed at finding a verification method for future limitations on nuclear tests. <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON>, though, said those in the nuclear weapons industry are proceeding slowly with any preparations for a possible test ban. `` The pro-nuclear forces in this business do n't want to be ready for a test ban,'' he said. `` They simply feel the best way to avoid one is to be unprepared for it.'' At the site itself _ where 5,500 people work in an area the size of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, `` There's not anything as organized as a contingency plan to mothball the test site,'' <PERSON> Aquilina </PERSON> said. `` We do n't have a specific plan for that.''

 As an Episcopal priest, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> prays that no one will ever use what he helps to produce at his day job. Other priests may lead protests against nuclear weapons; <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> leads the teams that explode those weapons deep underground at the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Test Site. It's contradictory, being `` the only priest I know who fires nuclear weapons.'' And it forces him almost daily to reconcile his occupation and his calling. `` There are no right or wrong answers,'' he said. `` I would like to be in a situation where there are no nuclear weapons. But I would also like a situation where we maintain the system of freedom and justice we have in our country.'' The 48-year-old deputy manager of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> operations for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is a nuclear veteran, having begun his career in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> on the staff of Adm. <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rickover </PERSON>, a force behind nuclear development. He's a newcomer to the clergy, however, having for years put aside his thoughts of becoming a priest. `` The way God works, he just does n't follow the rules at all. With my family, work and other commitments, I thought becoming a priest was something that just could n't happen,'' said the father of two. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a lifelong <PERSON> Episcopalian </PERSON>, was nominated into the priesthood by the congregation at <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Saints </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> under a canon allowing elevation of parishioners to priests in remote parishes. He was ordained two years ago. The church has not taken a position on continued nuclear testing. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> takes pains to separate his role as a priest from the job in which he has given the final approval to detonate more than 30 nuclear devices. But he also believes his experience in the weapons program has given him insight into the everyday world that is useful in his role as a priest. `` I deal with a lot of real world things here that perhaps the clergy who have been clergy for their whole careers do n't see,'' he said. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> does n't shy away from defending his beliefs on continued nuclear testing and he is often asked to go before anti-nuclear groups and explain the government's position that testing is vital to the nation's security. `` I do n't think in any of these discussions I change anybody's mind or they change mine, but we come away from honest and direct discussions the better for it The best comment I ever got from one anti-nuclear activist was, ` I do n't agree with what you're doing, but I'm glad you're the one doing it.''' `` He's the kind of guy I admire and respect whether he worked for me or was on the other side,'' said <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquilina </PERSON>, manager of the test site. `` I believe he comes across in a very credible way because he's so honest. I've never second-guessed his motives on anything because he's always so honest.'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> goes out of his way not to criticize anti-nuclear protesters who often congregate at the gates of the test site. Many, in fact, are his friends, including the wife of another Episcopal priest in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> and the priest's wife are founding board members and work closely together on a project to build a shelter for homeless women and children in the city. `` We just do n't talk about nuclear weapons when we're working together. She and I have the same ultimate aim. We'd both like not to have nuclear weapons. The difference is how we get there.''

 <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> is a bright, witty 10-year-old whose 2-foot-11-inch frame is so brittle he breaks like a china doll. `` He will never be a <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Namath </PERSON>; an <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>, maybe. We take things one day at a time,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON>, whose son has osteogenesis imperfecta, a relatively rare genetic bone disorder for which science has no cure. It's caused more than 30 fractures so far, stunted <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>'s growth and left him confined to a wheelchair Doctors do n't know if he'll ever walk. `` At the moment there are really no good medical therapies that make a difference long term,'' says Dr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Byers </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> medical geneticist who specializes in inherited diseases, including osteogenesis imperfecta. For the short term, surgeons put metal rods through the bones in <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>'s deformed legs to strengthen them. Rodding, exercise and external splinting seem to be the best that medicine has to offer OI patients. An estimated 20,000 to 25,000 Americans suffer from the disease, which is a lack of collagen or protein in the bone. It is either inherited or caused by some mutation in a gene. OI patients often have triangular heads and barrel chests that can lead to pulmonary and spinal problems. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> has a 7-year-old buddy, <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Metcalf </PERSON>, who also suffers from OI. The two match wits at computer games or sit giggling on the living room carpet as they bat a sponge ball around in a fast game of catch. The die-hard football fans cheer the <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buccaneers </ORGANIZATION> from the sidelines during home games. <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> was born with three breaks and four shortened bones. `` Basically, we were told to handle this child as fine crystal,'' said his father, <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Metcalf </PERSON>. `` But you've got to assess the risk, take precautions, then let them go out and play despite the outcome. The interaction is important.'' Sometimes, just twisting during sleep can break a child's limb. Picking up a baby up can fracture the frail bones. Often parents sandwich newborns between pieces of foam for support to turn the child over or change a diaper. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> broke an arm while asleep; his right leg at six months, his left leg the month after. `` Here we have all this attention on child abuse and I'm carrying around this little body with all these casts,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> `` I was ready to get a T-shirt that read: ` I have brittle bones.''' At <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montessori </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> where <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> is a fifth-grader, <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Nettie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossi </PERSON> credits <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> and <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> for their son's academic and social achievements. `` They're so supportive. They explain things, prepare him, then let him go out and do what he has to do. They do n't baby him.'' As a result, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> plays ball from his wheelchair and does pushups with his class of 27. `` He has a really good outlook. I'm sure he has his moments but they do n't show here,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Rossi </PERSON> said `` He has a sense of hummor, is bright, a good conversationalist and just an all-around good guy. The kids treat him like one of them.'' OI can be so severe it claims a child at birth, or so mild a person may only show the tell-tale blue sclerae, a blue color to the whites of the eyes, and suffer a few dozen fractures over a lifetime. `` Some clearly have a shortened life span. They get curvature of the spine, or suffer compressed lungs making the heart and lungs work harder. Others have a near normal life,'' <PERSON> Byers </PERSON> said. `` It's devastating news at birth that your child has a mind-boggling disease,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, 42, an accountant with a mild case of OI who is director of accounting for the Shriners and treasurer of the <ORGANIZATION> Osteogenesis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Imperfecta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, both headquartered in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>. The foundation formed as a volunteer organization in 1970. In November 1987, members decided to organize and centralize to offer support, help collect information about the disease and share it with other patients and with members of the medical profession. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, 4-foot-10 and ambulatory, said he stopped counting bone breaks after more than 90 during his growing years, adding, `` We do break easy, but we seem to heal faster and that's a plus.''

 Would-be super athletes who take on projects like bicycling across the country are psychologically pretty much like the rest of us, but may offer some clues on handling daily stress, researchers say. `` We look at sports as a way to look at other things in life that are harder to study,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Whelan </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Memphis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> psychologist and part of a team studying riders in the annual Race Across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Even though they voluntarily take on the grueling challenge, riders are n't psychologically unusual, said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, the study director. `` We thought we'd find that they were all crazy but the data just does n't support that.'' The racers ride for 10 days with one to two hours of sleep a night, conditions producing what <PERSON> Whelan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> say produces a unique source of study subjects under extreme physical and emotional stress. `` These people reported some rather serious psychological disturbances during the race,'' <PERSON> Whelan </PERSON> said. `` There were perceptual distortions. `` For example, they would see trees get up and move, which they knew was n't happening and it was bizarre to them. A fair number at different times during the race would actually hallucinate _ they'd see dragons coming out of the woods For some riders, their ability to see the world around them was so impaired they had to stop riding for a period of time.'' The researchers still are evaluating data from the 1988 and 1989 races, but <PERSON> Whelan </PERSON> said some factors already stand out on dealing with stress. Riders who could concentrate on the task, set and achieve reasonable interim goals and rely emotionally on their support teams generally came out best. `` Among those who finished the race, we found that their skills in concentration and mental preparation and motivation mediated their emotional deterioration,'' he said. `` What we're talking about here is not just are they more motivated but do they have the skills to keep themselves motivated. You can be real motivated at the start but 1,500 miles into the race, when you're hitting 100-degree days, how do you keep yourself into what you're doing?'' The racers learned the needed skills through years of training and competition, but they can be taught to non-athletes, `` ... in particular how they plan for something, how concentrated they are on the task, how well they're able to keep themselves motivated, how well they're able to deal with anxieties and worries and their ability to depend on others for support and encouragement,'' he said. Riders participating in the study filled out questionnaires at the beginning and end of the races and also were questioned at various stages along the 3,000-mile route. Research assistants conducted the in-race surveys hanging out the window of a chase van. As one would expect, they found that the mood of the riders deteriorated dramatically as the race wore on. Twenty-six of the 34 riders in 1988 took part in the study and 20 of the 27 riders in 1989. `` People just get involved in seeing how far they can ride and this is an ultimate challenge,'' <PERSON> Whelan </PERSON> said. `` They're pretty normal folks who become focused on this sort of activity. They dream about whether they can cross the country and how fast they can do it, but they're no different from any other sort of athlete or other people who enter a hobby and become really involved in it.''

<HEAD>Food-Poisoning Toxin Helps Vocal Cord Disorder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Small doses of a toxin that causes food poisoning can help people with a condition that strangles their voices, researchers say. Injections of botulinum into the vocal cords of people with spasmodic dysphonia relax the tightly squeezed cords within days, said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Tulane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s department of otolaryngology and head and neck surgery The only adverse reactions are brief hoarseness and difficulty swallowing, and the toxin does not spread to the rest of the body. Spasmodic dysphonia is uncommon, but reliable estimates are not available of the number of people affected. It seems to worsen with stress and was long thought to be psychosomatic, but evidence has accumulated linking the problem to nerve disorders such as tics and other uncontrollable movements. Injections of botulinum toxin have been used to treat facial tics, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said, so researchers decided to try it against the vocal cord disorder. Work is also being done in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, said Dr. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Jankovic </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> neurologist. The treatment does not cure the condition. The shots, costing about $ 300 each, must be repeated every few months. The toxin works with the vocal cords for much the same reason it causes food poisoning, <PERSON> Jankovic </PERSON> said. In each case, it binds to the synapse and blocks release of acetylcholine, a chemical that helps transmit nerve impulses. In the case of food poisoning, the nervous system's control over breathing often is disrupted, causing death by respiratory paralysis, he said.

<HEAD>Listening to the Private Lives of Hogs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Researchers are eavesdropping on the most private, intimate moments in the lives of hogs, hoping for hints that will help farmers. `` We're not trying to talk to the animals. What we're doing is listening to the animals and seeing what they have to tell us,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> DeShazer </PERSON>, who has established that hogs make different sounds identifiable with greeting humans, romancing mating partners, hunger, stress and other conditions. In a more subtle distinction, sound - and signal-analysis equipment has helped determine that there is a single peak to a sound wave emitted by a sow during nursing and a double peak to the sound while giving birth `` Even though it's not picked up by hearing, instruments and maybe other animals can pick it up,'' said <PERSON> DeShazer </PERSON>, an agricultural engineering professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska-Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> whose research has drawn on the talents of psychologists, speech clinicians and even dentists. Differentiating hog sounds could have practical applications. Microphones and sound-measuring devices could summon a farmer to help when a sow is giving birth, for example, or could identify sounds inaudible to humans that might be stressful to hogs _ like a squeaking ventilator fan, he said. Such equipment `` allows us to pick up sounds animals make and to analyze those sounds that tell us there's some stress problems or other indicators that need to be taken care of, or that things seem to be all right.''

The Dietary Guidelines Way,'' a collection of four colorful booklets that make making the right food choices easier. `` What we want consumers to know is that they can eat healthier without changing all their eating habits overnight or giving up their favorite foods,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Welsh </PERSON>, director of the nutrition education division of the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The booklets cover shopping, quick meals, menus, making lunches and snacks, desserts and eating out. They're based on the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s nutrition recommendations and are available from the government's Consumer Information Unlike some efforts to improve nutrition, this one starts from what is known about the way people eat. It accepts that almost everyone snacks, but it suggests ways to make snacks parts of a healthy diet. The books are clear and filled with detailed information on what to do to improve eating habits. Many Americans would be surprised at how easy it is to make a significant change, <PERSON> Welsh </PERSON> said. Salad dressings, for example, contribute an average 9 percent of total fat in women's diets. The booklets, available from the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, Dept. 70, <LOCATION> Pueblo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION> 81009, are: _ `` Preparing Foods and Planning Menus,'' $ 2.50, Item No. 172-V. How to cut sodium, fat and sugar in baking; how various cooking methods work; planning menus; specific ways to follow the old admonition to eat from all food groups; nutritional needs at different ages; charts of fats, sodium and sugar in dozens of standard foods; revising sample menus to improve nutritional content _ `` Making Bag Lunches, Snacks and Desserts,'' $ 2.50, Item No. 173-V. Lists calories, fat, sodium and cholesterol for a variety of sandwich ingredients; recipes for soups, sandwich fillings and desserts; snack suggestions. Charts the nutritional cost of lunch selected from vending machines. _ `` Shopping for Food and Making Meals in Minutes,'' $ 3, Item No. 174-V. A fourth of the people in a recent survey said speed and easy preparation had top priority in buying food Booklet includes strategies to organize the kitchen, quick-cooking methods, how to evaluate recipes, reading labels at the supermarket, unit pricing, selecting the right foods. _ `` Eating Better When Eating Out,'' $ 1.50, Item No. 175-V. Making choices among limited offerings at restaurants A sample menu and quiz for selecting well from it. Choosing from fast-food menus.

 An East German economic recovery like the one that transformed war-ravaged <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> into one of the world's richest nations hangs on the fate of a crudely minted, featherweight coin <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s aluminum Ostmark is non-convertible abroad and quickly losing its value at home due to a dearth of goods and a free fall on illegal exchange markets. West German financial experts consider currency reform to be a crucial first step toward a convertible Ostmark and economic recovery.

 Interest rate jitters continued to pressure the stock market Wednesday, pushing prices lower. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 13.23 points to 2,688.78. The dollar turned in a mixed performance as the West German mark continued to dominate the foreign-exchange markets. Gold prices fell sharply in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> after edging higher overseas. Bond prices gave ground amid pessimism about the possibility that interest rates will fall any time soon. Pork-belly futures fell the limit for the second straight day; oil futures advanced; and grains and soybeans were mixed.

<TEXT>
 The Savoy Hotel, an upper-crust British institution, has won an eight-year legal battle to fend off a takeover by <ORGANIZATION> Trusthouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a giant hotel and catering chain founded by an Italian immigrant. Lord <PERSON> Forte </PERSON>, who powered <PERSON> Trusthouse </PERSON> on the back of a single <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> milk-drinks counter he opened in the 1930s, called off the fight Wednesday because he was not willing to spend large sums of money in legal fees, an aide said. <PERSON> Trusthouse </PERSON> said it would not buy any more shares in <ORGANIZATION> Savoy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> for five years and the <PERSON> Savoy </PERSON> said it would not issue any more shares for five years without <PERSON> Trusthouse </PERSON> approval. After spending about $ 64 million, <PERSON> Trusthouse </PERSON> owns 69 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Savoy </ORGANIZATION> shares but controls only 42.3 percent because of the stock's voting structure <PERSON> Forte </PERSON> employed a team of lawyers in an unsuccessful bid to gain more votes. In return for the truce, the <ORGANIZATION> Savoy </ORGANIZATION> offered seats on its board to <PERSON> Rocco </PERSON> <PERSON> Forte </PERSON>, Lord <PERSON> Forte </PERSON>'s son and <PERSON> Trusthouse </PERSON> chief executive, and to <PERSON> Trusthouse </PERSON> financial director <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Main </PERSON>. But Savoy Manging Director <PERSON> Giles </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> said he will continue to have final say in the Savoy's operations. He estimated that fending off the takeover had cost the Savoy at least $ 1.56 million in legal fees. `` We are delighted to have come to this agreement with the Savoy,'' <PERSON> Rocco </PERSON> <PERSON> Forte </PERSON> said. `` We have always recognized the excellence of the Savoy's hotels'' Built in 1889, the Savoy runs separate kitchens on each of its seven floors, keeps count of its famous guests' tastes throughout their lives and decorates its 300 rooms individually so that no two are identical. The company also operates other famous hotels _ <PERSON> Claridge </PERSON>'s, the Connaught, the <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> and the Hotel Lancaster in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Royalty stays at <PERSON> Claridge </PERSON>'s and the superpowers hold banquets there when their leaders come to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Trusthouse </PERSON> claims to be the world's most profitable hotel and catering chain and looks after entertaining at the 10 Downing Street residence of Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who admires its entrepreneurship. Sir <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Wontner </PERSON>, chairman of the company that owns the <PERSON> Savoy </PERSON> and a former lord mayor of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, has been catering adviser to Buckingham Palace for more than 50 years and his family controls 10 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Savoy </ORGANIZATION> shares. <PERSON> Wontner </PERSON> said quality comes before profit. Lord <PERSON> Forte </PERSON> said they go hand-in-hand. <PERSON> Trusthouse </PERSON> operates in more than 40 countries and Lord <PERSON> Forte </PERSON> once said the Savoy's profits could be doubled in one year if its `` grossly overpaid'' top management were fired. During the legal fight, Lord Forte charged the <ORGANIZATION> Savoy </ORGANIZATION> directors with not maximizing potential profits from the famous hotels in Savoy group. <PERSON> Wontner </PERSON> dismissed <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Forte </PERSON> as `` not a hotelier, just a caterer,'' while <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Trusthouse </PERSON>: `` You've got a difference in philosophy, a David versus Goliath. ... I just do n't believe they'll provide quite what we do. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Evening </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported the peace pact represented defeat for Lord <PERSON> Forte </PERSON>'s efforts to `` break his way'' into the British upper class `` establishment.'' Neither Lord <PERSON> Forte </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Wontner </PERSON>, both of whom are 81, attended the peace pact signing, which must be approved by <PERSON> Savoy </PERSON> stockholders.

<HEAD>Third-Quarter After-Tax Profits Fall Sharply</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations' after-tax profits fell for the third straight quarter in a sharp 7.2 percent decline attributed largely to losses stemming from Hurricane Hugo, the government said. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday the drop followed an identical fall in the second quarter, which was the steepest in three years, and a 1.1 percent decline in the first quarter. The changes left after-tax profits at an annual rate of $ 149.5 billion in the July to September period. A broader measure, before-tax profits adjusted for depreciation and inventories, decreased at an annual rate of $ 15.5 billion to $ 292.3 billion. But $ 11 billion of that was attributed to hurricane-related losses _ $ 9 billion from payouts by insurance companies and $ 2 billion from uninsured losses. Analysts also attributed the poor showing to firms' inability to raise prices to compensate for rising labor costs and to slower growth in export sales. Exports are being hurt by the strong dollar, which makes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods more expensive on overseas markets. `` The problem is very basic. Labor costs are rising and prices are not going up fast enough to cover the increase,'' said economist <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Analysts said the profit squeeze likely will continue Consumer resistance caused by a softening economy, as well as stiff competition from overseas firms, will make it difficult for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies to raise prices. Economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> DRI-McGraw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, forecasting firm, said fourth-quarter profits also will be depressed by a strike at the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and from insurance losses attributable to the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> earthquake. A likely result of lower profits will be weaker investment spending by businesses, a bright spot in previous quarters. Business capital spending grew at an annual rate of 4.6 percent in the third quarter, down from a previous estimate of 5.8 percent and sharply lower than the second-quarter rate of 8.6 percent. Corporate cash flows, a measure intended to show funds corporations have available for investment, rose 1.3 percent in the third quarter, compared with a 0.8 percent rise in the second and a 5.6 percent decline in the first. Dividend payments to stockholders increased 2 percent to an annual rate of $ 123.3 billion after an identical increase in the second quarter.

<HEAD>Early Reading on Holiday Sales: Mixed to Disappointing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Cooperative weather and widespread markdowns are luring shoppers to the stores, but retailers are n't expecting this year's holiday shopping season to be a blockbuster, an industry economist says. <PERSON> Rosalind </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, the chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, also said Wednesday that continued discounting is likely as merchants try to draw customers who might otherwise take advantage of an extra pre-Christmas weekend and wait until the last minute to shop. She said feedback from stores around the country showed a patchy pattern of sales in the days immediately after Thanksgiving _ when shoppers traditionally launch their annual buying binge. `` My feeling is that it was a pretty good start to the season but nothing exceptional,'' Ms. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said. Speaking at a luncheon meeting with reporters, Ms. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said that after talking with retailers about business last Friday through Sunday `` My sense ... is that there was overall some disappointment.'' The nation's major retailers will provide an early reading on the holidays when they release monthly sales figures on Thursday. Most of the big chain stores will report their results for the four weeks ended Nov. 25. Like other analysts, Ms. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> expects a mediocre Christmas for the retail industry. She has predicted holiday sales will rise 5.5 percent this year over last year, when the sales gain was 9 percent over 1987. `` I think the preliminary results we're getting are consistent with our forecast,'' she said. Continuing an almost year-long trend, clothing is moving the fastest, paced by sales of womens apparel, Ms. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said. Mens and childrens wear sales are less robust. There also is continued weakness in sales of home-related merchandise, such as furniture, floor coverings, curtains and appliances. Markdowns by stores strapped for cash and by their competitors are giving sales a boost, especially in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said. A cold snap in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and elsewhere also is encouraging shoppers to buy winter goods. She said special holiday promotions are pervasive and particularly intense in areas that have stores owned by financially troubled <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, whose properties include <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marsh </LOCATION>, The Bon and <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>'s Another highly leveraged retailer, <ORGANIZATION> R.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, is responding with aggressive promotions of its own. In addition to the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, sales promotions seem to be having a major impact in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> and several other areas. Business between Thanksgiving and Christmas generates as much as half of a retailer's annual income. In the retailers' favor, the holiday shopping season is longer this year than last year by 1 day, spanning a total of 31 days. In 1987, the peak spending season was 28 days. But Ms. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said there is a drawback to this year's calendar. Many shoppers, knowing they have a final weekend for gift hunting, might put off buying until the last minute. By that time, retailers would be anxious for business and might offer even bigger markdowns to attract customers, which would cut into their profits. `` I think there's a high probability that that's going to be the case,'' Ms. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Administration Says It Won't Cut Funds for Computer Chip Research</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The White House's science adviser has denied reports the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration may seek to slash federal support for <ORGANIZATION> Sematech </ORGANIZATION>, an industry-government consortium working to develop advanced computer chips. `` I personally am completely unaware of any move to reduce support for <ORGANIZATION> Sematech </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bromley </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> defense industry and technology subcommittee on Wednesday. But he said the administration does not endorse an advisory committee's recommendation that government funding for <ORGANIZATION> Sematech </ORGANIZATION> be substantially increased from its current level of $ 100 million a year. That money is matched by another $ 100 million from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies. Sen. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.M. </LOCATION>, the subcommittee chairman, said he was `` concerned over recent reports of attempts by administration officials to drastically reduce or eliminate funding for a number of existing programs, such as <ORGANIZATION> Sematech </ORGANIZATION>.'' Other Pentagon-funded programs that <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON> said may face cutbacks include manufacturing technology, high-definition computer displays and X-ray lithography, a technique used for producing powerful semiconductor chips. `` I believe that -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- has an appropriate role in supporting research in long-term, high-risk, high-potential technologies,'' he said. <PERSON> Bromley </PERSON> testified he shares the concerns expressed in a recent report by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductors </ORGANIZATION> over the danger of losing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> world leadership in the semiconductor industry. `` In many ways, what has and is happening to the semiconductor industry is a paradigm for what could happen to other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industries such as the computer and telecommunications industries unless corrective actions are taken in the immediate future,'' he said. However, <PERSON> Bromley </PERSON> contended that `` the money for direct government subsidies to somehow reverse the situation by brute force is not now available, and it is unlikely ever to be available. Even if such funding were available, it is unlikely that such an approach would work.'' The semiconductors advisory committee recommended that <ORGANIZATION> Sematech </ORGANIZATION>'s funding should be increased immediately by $ 100 million a year, split evenly between industry and government. It said additional funding of $ 800 million will be required over the next three years. But <PERSON> Bromley </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Office of Science and Technology Policy, said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration does not endorse `` major increases in federal funding levels for <ORGANIZATION> Sematech </ORGANIZATION>.'' He also said the administration opposes creation of a publicly supported corporation to rebuild the consumer electronics industry in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>U.S. Negotiators Urged To Use Defense Accords To Push Trade</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A business group formed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has urged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators to use defense accords with <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies to open more trade opportunities for American business. The <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Negotiations </ORGANIZATION>, which consists primarily of business executives, said Wednesday the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> should coordinate negotiating strategy with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative to boost business. The report on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> comes as the 12-nation trade bloc prepares to make its 320 million consumers into a single market in 1992. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said in a statement that the report's recommendations `` suggest very constructive steps that can be taken by the private sector.'' She did not refer specifically to the defense accords. That recommendation pointed to agreements called `` memorandums of understanding'' between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and individual member <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> governments. Hundreds of the agreements concern the buying of weapons worth billions of dollars. Some are always being renegotiated by <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials and European goverments. The report said renegotiations should be used as leverage to make international rules apply to a greater share of European governments' spending. It said such leverage would help expand rules to new areas of interest to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exporters. Spending by European governments was one of six issues highlighted in the report. The report said the 12 governments buy $ 600 billion worth of goods and services every year, including about $ 150 billion for defense. It said 95 percent of the money is spent within each country. The report also recommended ways to safeguard <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business interests in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by urging governments there to: _ Loosen requirements on the origin of imported goods _ Give Americans a greater share in setting up rules for testing _ Help get a common standard for enforcing rules on the transfer of technology _ Be flexible about buying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television programs _ Improve the conditions for foreign insurance and investment companies

 Three activist groups have called for the ouster of thrift regulator <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> but stopped short of recommending the same for five senators who interceded with his agency on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Joining a growing chorus of critics who blame Wall primarily for <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s loss of up to $ 2.5 billion in federally insured deposits were the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxpayers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION>. The three groups on Wednesday urged President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a letter to dismiss <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> as director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thrift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION>, saying his decision to delay closing <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> for 20 months `` may have cost citizens of this country more than any other political appointee in history.'' On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, also called for Wall's resignation, saying, `` Everybody will be better served by a clean break and new leadership.'' <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, asked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a letter last month to replace Wall. And <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters earlier this month he `` is not closing the door'' to that possibility. But at the White House on Wednesday, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said no decision has been made. `` There's been no consideration of Mr. <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>'s tenure,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` He's serving on the board and there's been no change.'' <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said Sunday that he has no intention of resigning and a spokesman for him reasserted that Tuesday. Meanwhile, his office issued press releases Wednesday quoting new studies as saying that <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>'s handling of 223 S & amp; L failures last year saved the government $ 6 billlion to $ 8 billion. `` ... While some of the 1988 deals are souring, enough of them are holding together to make it worthwhile, so far, for Wall to have stuck his neck out,'' said <PERSON> Veribank </PERSON>, a bank rating firm based in <LOCATION> Wakefield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. Wall was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> from July 1987 until last August, when its function as the federal regulator of the savings and loan industry was transferred to the new office he now heads in the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. For nearly two months, he has been the chief target of hearings by <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>' committee into why the bank board allowed <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> to remain open until last April even though examiners had recommended in May 1987 closing the <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, thrift. `` Mr. <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>'s behavior ..., in which he frequently appeared to knuckle under to political pressure from members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the thrift industry, shows he is not qualified to hold office in an administration dedicated to high ethical standards. ...,'' the three public interest groups said in their letter Wednesday to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. None of the groups was willing to say at a news conference that the five senators who interceded on behalf of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> in two April 1987 meetings with <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>'s predecessor and <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> officials in charge of the case should also step down. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is now investigating whether <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> and the four other senators _ <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION> _ violated Together, the five senators accepted a total of $ 1.3 million in contributions for their campaigns or other political causes raised by <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s owner, <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> millionaire <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> and <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> have since returned the money they received

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plans to choose <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a chief architect of the administration's bailout bill for the savings and loan industry, to fill a vacancy on the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, an administration source said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plans to nominate <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON>, an assistant secretary of the treasury, to fill a vacancy on the seven-member board expiring Jan. 31, 1996, said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> acknowledged that <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON> is the top candidate for the vacancy, adding, `` We have not made an announcement at this point. It could come at any day, though.'' <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON>, 43, a former <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> professor, is a longtime associate of Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and began serving in his current post in October 1988, shortly after <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> became secretary. This year, <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON> attended lengthy congressional sessions to write S & amp; L legislation, representing the administration in behind-the-scenes deliberations. Earlier, he was the No. 2 staff person on a presidential task force <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> headed that studied the October 1987 stock market crash. `` His association with <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> has been so close he's going to be viewed as the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s man on the board,'' said economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> DRI-McGraw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, forecasting firm. `` Any time you get a strong administration type on the board, it gives the administration a little stronger finger on the lever of monetary policy.'' In recent months, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has been somewhat at odds with the administration, which has favored lower interest rates than the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> and has pressed the central bank to be more aggressive in efforts to improve the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit by manipulating the value of the dollar on world currency markets. <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON> would be <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first appointment to the board. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> named the other six members. However, economists warned that previous <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> appointees viewed as administration representatives subsequently took an independent line. `` Vice Chairman -LRB- <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> came over from the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, but he quickly became his own man,'' said economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a government securities dealer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON>, if nominated and approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, would succeed <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>, who resigned from the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> in June to become executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Visa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, the credit card company. <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON> has little professional background in broad economic and monetary policy-making but is highly regarded as an expert on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial markets and the banking system. He received his undergraduate degree from <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and graduate degrees from the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. He grew up in <LOCATION> Fayetteville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, where his father was president of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, as the nation's central bank, attempts to fight inflation and sustain economic growth by manipulating interest rates. It also regulates the banks that are members of its system and governs the activities of bank holding companies.

 Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which he heads, will consider a wide array of proposals next year for encouraging saving and investment, including a cut in capital-gains taxes. Expanded Individual Retirement Accounts also will be considered as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> looks for ways to increase productivity and the nation's ability to compete with foreign producers, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` Is there no way <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can better compete abroad?'' the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat asked in remarks prepared for a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` In fact, there is. The key is to accumulate investment capital _ and then use that capital to restore our manufacturing base from the 21 percent of gross national product it is today to about 25 percent.'' With <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, leading the way, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this year defeated President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call for a reduction in taxes on capital gains, which are profits from the sale of investments. Democratic leaders viewed the proposed reduction as a windfall for the rich, the beginning of the undoing of the landmark 1986 tax overhaul and a deficit-increaser that would do little for the economy. They responded with a plan to liberalize tax-deductible IRAs but withdrew that proposal when the capital-gains cut failed. In his remarks to the <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which honored him with its distinguished achievement award, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> had much to say in favor of IRAs but little for a capital-gains tax cut. He cited <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s experience as evidence that IRAs encourage saving. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian savings rates were comparable until the mid-1970s, when the Canadian rate soared but the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rate fell to less than half that of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` What accounts for this sudden divergence? Some economists believe it can be attributed to broader eligibility and higher limits for <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> plans in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. He said he once supported a lower capital-gains tax rate. But that preferential rate was far more important when the nation's wealthiest people paid tax rates as high as 90 percent on part of their income, he said He criticized the temporary nature of the capital-gains tax cut passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> this year and said supporters of a reduction must find a way to pay for it. For a cut to win his support, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, `` We would have to answer the virtually unanimous verdict of economists that after ... -LRB- the -RRB- first year such a cut drains the treasury.''

<HEAD>Shearson Restructures; AmEx Reportedly Seeking New Capital Infusion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A major restructuring announced by <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> comes as Wall Street's second-largest brokerage confronts the fallout from an expansion strategy that was shaken by a downturn in the securities industry. `` We are moving from a period of growth by acquisition to a period of internal consolidation and selective expansion,'' <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said Wednesday as the brokerage announced major changes in its management structure. The restructuring, which had been expected, comes on the heels of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement that it will lay off hundreds of workers and make a drastic cut in stockbroker commissions. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> also reportedly is seeking an outside investor to provide it with a capital infusion and reduce <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s 61 percent stake in <LOCATION> Shearson </LOCATION>. Under the management shuffle, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> is reassigning President <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> to a lesser position and shifting another dozen top executives. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> also established four core business groups and disbanded its main policy making group. Pressure has increased on Shearson and other Wall Street firms because of sagging profits in an overall industry slowdown since the October 1987 stock market crash. `` <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> would like to see their ownership generating higher profits,'' said analyst <ORGANIZATION> Perrin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lipper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analytical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. `` But if the environment does n't get better it's going to be difficult for anyone in the industry to have better profits.'' <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> is dividing its businesses into four groups _ capital markets, investment and merchant banking, private client and subsidiary activities _ similar to realigmnents by other firms in recent years. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> will head the subsidiary activities group that will include <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s money management businesses, which have more than $ 95 billion in assets under management, and its <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> division. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuld </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who heads <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s taxable fixed-income division, was seen as replacing <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> as <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>'s second-in-command, although <PERSON> Fuld </PERSON> was not named as <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> president. <PERSON> Fuld </PERSON> was named president of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s capital markets group, which will include the company's worldwide capital markets activities. He also will oversee <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s administrative side. <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> will head the investment and merchant banking group and <PERSON> Hardwick </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> will be president of the private client group, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s brokerage operations. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> is disbanding its chief policy-making committee, the 11-member policy group, but will create a business development committee to `` help identify future directions for the firm.'' <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s net income fell to $ 106 million in the first nine months of this year, down 3 percent from $ 110 million in the same period last year. The firm's woes stem partly from its January 1988 acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> E.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for close to $ 1 billion and its 1984 merger with <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kuhn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loeb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The latter deal marked a major expansion for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> from retail brokerage into investment banking _ essentially arranging or providing financing for corporate buyouts. Analysts said <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>'s old business generally has helped the firm in the last two years, but <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s pre-tax profit margin has not approached its pre-merger levels of 15 percent. For the 1989 third quarter, pre-tax profit margin was just over 1 percent, compared with an industry average of about 4 percent. Additionally, analysts said, the <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> buyout saddled <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> with debt and cost the firm more than $ 1 billion in writeoffs. `` Following the <LOCATION> Lehman </LOCATION> acquisition the significant increase in the capital markets business really made them a force, particularly in mergers and acquisitions,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckenfelder </PERSON>, a securities industry analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. But, he said: `` The <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> acquisition created problems because the business did n't really pick up. It dissipated.'' Because of the slowdown, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> this month said it would cut broker commissions by 1 percent to 2 percent in 1990 and lay off up to 800 employees by year's end. That would reduce the firm to 35,700 employees from a peak of 46,000. Also, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> reportedly is considering selling a portion of its <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> stake to an outside investor to provide the firm with more capital. A deal would have to be approved by <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which owns 13 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>. The capital infusion could help appease <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The Wall Street credit rating agency last month said it was considering lowering its rating on <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s long - and short-term debt because of the firm's exposure to corporate buyout debts and its softening business prospects <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kriz </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> assistant vice president, said Wednesday the credit rating agency had not made a decision on <LOCATION> Shearson </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Publisher Launches Magazine for Family-Owned Businesses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The owner of an automobile dealership may have more in common than he realizes with the couple that runs a few retail stores or the building contractor who owns operations spread over several states. They are all involved in family-run businesses, and are the targets of the publishers of a new magazine called Family Business. The premiere issue of the magazine was recently sent to a charter susbcriber group numbering 100,000. The magazine will be available monthly both at the newstand and by subscription starting in January. In an interview Wednesday, Publisher <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Zweig </PERSON> estimated there are 7 million family-owned businesses in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But he said that despite the introduction of a number of consumer-oriented business magazines over the past several years, he found none that dealt exclusively with issues important to owners of family businesses. Entrepreneur, for instance, contains information on how to get a business started. But <PERSON> Zweig </PERSON> said information on how to pass a business along to heirs may be more relevant for a family-run business that has dealt with startup issues generations earlier. `` There has been a resurgence of interest in family businesses,'' <PERSON> Zweig </PERSON> said. He said MBA students five years ago would seldom admit it if they intended to go to work for their own family's business, but today are forming clubs where issues affecting such operations are discussed. The takeover wave has made family-run business a more appealing career option, he said. `` Corporate life is not offering the secure niche people thought it was,'' he said. <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Husni </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> journalism professor who publishes an annual guide to new magazines, said it appears that Family Business has found a niche that has not been filled by other magazines. `` It's a good idea but how well they execute the idea remains to be seen,'' he said. He estimates only two of 10 new magazines survive four years. Family Business is designed for the 1.5 million to 2 million family-owned businesses with sales of $ 1 million to $ 100 million, <PERSON> Zweig </PERSON> said. The cover story in the first issue deals with a company that is called into to contain oil and toxic waste spills on waterways, and describes how the father who owns the business is learning to trust his children to run it. Another story discusses how healthy family companies base salaries for family members on performance rather than sentiment. Regular features will include an advice column with tips on raising capital, handling tax issues and settling disputes. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nessel </PERSON>, a former editorial executive with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and Psychology Today magazines, is the editor-in-chief of Family Business, which is being published from <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barrington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. Publishing consultant <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Periodical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said new magazines for small business are `` a hot genre'' sustained partly by the need to advertise a proliferation of new products these businesses may find useful, such as computers, fax machines and cellular telephones. Advertisers in the first issue included investment and business consulting companies, financial services concerns and office equipment makers. There were 12 pages of ads in the first 72-page issue. <PERSON> Zweig </PERSON> plans to have an editorial-to-advertising ratio of 60 percent to 40 percent. The magazine is owned by <ORGANIZATION> MLR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>, a family-run business based in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> that publishes the professional magazines Mergers & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Acquisitions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Directors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Boards and offers database services. <PERSON> Zweig </PERSON> said MLR is investing several million dollars in launching the magazine and expects that it will take four years for it to become profitable. He declined to be specific on how much MLR was prepared to lose. Subscriptions will cost $ 33.97 for a year and single copies will be sold for $ 3.50 each at the newstand. <PERSON> Zweig </PERSON> said he would eventually like to boost circulation to 250,000 to 300,000.

 Machinist union leaders have huddled to assess the impact of the defections of pilots and flight attendants on their strike against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and vowed to continue their walkout `` however long it takes.'' Machinists President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kourpias </PERSON> said Wednesday the union would try to pressure <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, and the bankruptcy court overseeing the cash-strapped carrier into a settlement. The plans include demanding that Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON>, in charge of the Eastern case since the airline filed for protection from creditors five days after the beginning of the strike, remove himself from the case. Kurpias and other Machinists leaders have accuse bias in favor of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> The union also plans to push Eastern to make ts to its pension plan, which is currently owedas $ 1 billion, and take legal action against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> if the payments are not madr cash and court actions involving the underfunded pension planaffect <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to emerge soon from baourpias, who met with Machinists Vice President paul and the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> union leaders, said the unould seek to lobby <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to win enough suppoident <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto of legislation creating a conanel to recommend a solution The pilots at attendants cited the veto last week in makingions to end sympathy strikes in support of the ists, who walked off the job March 4 after refusrant more than $ 150 million in work-rule and otoncessions sought by Eastern. <PERSON> Kourpias </PERSON>, in called those decisions `` disappointing'' but pon, now alone on the picket lines, `` will not en strike until the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> workers win the fairst treatment on the job that <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> tried to strip away when he forced the strike.'' The Machinists, however, face an array of obstacles to winning back the strike or the jobs of their more than 3,000 members who worked as mechanics and baggage handlers. Eastern was not concerned with the prospect of a <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> strike from the outset but was stung when the pilots unexpectedly supported the walkout. Since then, however, the Miami-based airline has been rebuilding and has told the 1,700 flight attendants and the 2,000 or so pilots that it has few if any jobs for those who now wish to return to work. Those unions hope to win more of their jobs back through negotiations with the company and are considering legal action against Eastern if those efforts fail. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Duent </PERSON> of the pilot's union, told reporters Wednesday he expects <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to rehire about 700 union pilots at a pace of about 100 a month. He said Eastern officials had taken a `` soft approach'' in initial discussions about returning to work. `` The airline needs some reconciliation with its traditional employees to work, because it's sure not working now,'' <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Survey: Women on Medical School Faculties Held Back by Motherhood</HEAD>

 Although female doctors can successfully combine child rearing with teaching at medical schools, most feel that motherhood has slowed their careers, according to a survey released today. Women make up 19 percent of medical school faculties _ up from 13 percent two decades ago _ but they have been slower to crack the the academic world's top ranks. A nationwide survey of 558 of these women, all younger than 50, found that nearly two-thirds had children. About half of those with youngsters had delayed starting their families until they were in their early 30s and had finished their medical training. Although the majority said they were satisfied with their careers and their decision to have children, 78 percent felt that their families had slowed their job advancement. `` We believe that it is possible for women to combine motherhood with a fulfilling career in academic medicine, but it is difficult, and most such women believe that motherhood slows the progress of their careers,'' the researchers wrote. Drs. <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolle </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, conducted the survey. The results were published in today's New England Journal of Medicine. To earn senior posts on medical faculties, junior doctors must first receive tenure, and that requires conducting research and publishing reports, among other duties. The study's authors suggested that women _ or men _ who take time off for their children be given longer to complete these milestones. `` For example, a faculty member working half time would have twice as long to achieve standards for promotion and tenure as those working full time,'' they wrote. In a separate commentary in the journal, Dr. <PERSON> Carola </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenberg </PERSON>, a child psychiatrist at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said medical schools should use affirmative action to get more women into their upper levels. `` If there is only one tenure slot and there are both men and women fully qualified to fill it, a woman should be appointed,'' she wrote. `` That is the only way to offset the prevailing pattern of discrimination.'' She also urged that the proportion of women among tenured faculty members rise from the current 6.7 percent to 10 percent within the next three years. `` Does anyone really believe that 500 qualified women can not be found among the 8,000 now at the level of assistant or associate professor to make this goal realistic?'' she asked.

<HEAD>House Panel Hears About Short-Selling Abuses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After two days of testimony on the pros and cons of short-selling by company heads, traders and exchange officials, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel is slated to hear from federal regulators next week. Market regulation and enforcement officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> are scheduled to testify about the trading strategy next Wednesday. When selling short, an investor tries to take advantage of an anticipated drop in a company's stock price. The investor borrows stock from a broker, hoping to replace it with stock purchased at a lower price. The investor's profit comes from the difference between the price of the borrowed stock and the lower price paid to replace it. Profits from short-selling can be huge, but the risks are great. If the stock's price does n't go down, the investor will have to pay a higher price to replace the borrowed stock. In opening three days of hearings on short-selling Tuesday, Rep. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Ga., said the practice is legitimate and accepted in the market, but the subcommittee was concerned about `` persistent reports of efforts by short-sellers to manipulate stock prices downward through various techniques meant to be harmful to the companies or their shareholders. <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> chairs the commerce, consumer and monetary affairs subcommittee of the House Government Operations Committee. On Wednesday, the head of a nationwide association of companies traded in the over-the-counter market told the panel that tougher federal disclosure laws are needed to curb manipulative practices in short-selling. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Guion </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> OTC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel that a survey conducted by the 800-member organization points out the need for such curbs. Of the 183 companies responding to the survey, 22 percent said they believed their company's stock had been the subject of short-selling by professional short-sellers. <PERSON> Guion </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> should adopt a rule requiring anyone who sells short a number of shares exceeding 5 percent of a company's outstanding stock notify the company, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and the market where the stock is traded within 10 days. In earlier testimony, other witnesses complained that professional short-sellers often break the rules to get a stock to drop quickly so they can take their profit and get out. Their alleged methods include spreading false rumors about a company that it is about to declare bankruptcy or that it is under <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> investigation. `` We find these companies are suffering from the standpoint of survival,'' said <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON>, the subcommittee chairman. <PERSON> Guion </PERSON> said 83 percent of the companies surveyed believe short-sellers should be required to report their short interest positions when they exceed a specified amount of shares. But other witnesses were less enthusiastic about such a requirement. `` It's difficult to say that additional information would not be helpful,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinto </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION>, a self-regulatory organization that oversees the over-the-counter market. `` But I really do n't think it would be a significant regulatory tool.''

 After a decade of playing the field _ from oilfields to goldfields _ <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Moffett </PERSON> is ready to settle down. <PERSON> Moffett </PERSON>, who assembled an unlikely combination of fertilizer mills, oil and gas wells, sulfur mines, <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> copper pits and Australian gold ore into the natural resources company <ORGANIZATION> Freeport-McMoRan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, will sell up to $ 1.5 billion worth of assets.

One unit already has been sold and two were put on the block earlier this year. Of the proceeds, $ 900 million will be used to support huge mineral discoveries made within the past 18 months. One is the largest known existing sulfur deposit in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, called Main Pass Block 299, situated under 200 feet of water off the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> coast. <ORGANIZATION> Freeport </ORGANIZATION>, which owns 58.3 percent of the deposit, estimates it's worth $ 5.4 billion. The other is the Grasberg deposit on the remote <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> island of <ORGANIZATION> Irian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jaya </ORGANIZATION>. Its 3.9 billion pounds of copper more than double the copper reserves of subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> Freeport-McMoRan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Copper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Mixed with the copper are 5.6 million ounces of gold _ more than the twice the 2.5 million ounces of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> reserves the company will unload by selling <ORGANIZATION> Freeport-McMoRan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Because the gold is mined along with copper and silver, its production costs should be substantially less than those of the North American With $ 1.8 billion in debt already on its books and only $ 474 million in equity as of Sept. 30, it was time to decide which assets were most expendable, <PERSON> Moffett </PERSON> said. `` We ca n't be everywhere any more,'' <PERSON> Moffett </PERSON> said. `` We have to find niches where we have a leg up.'' The company plans to use up to $ 600 million of the sale proceeds to cut debt. The assets up for sale generated at least $ 345 million in revenues in 1988, according to <ORGANIZATION> Freeport </ORGANIZATION> financial reports _ 18 percent of the company's total. But <PERSON> Moffett </PERSON> said earnings will remain steady through 1992. The gap will be made up by a combination of the cash from the asset sales, a $ 50 million cut in general and administrative costs and lower operating and interest expenses. After 1992, <PERSON> Moffett </PERSON> said, revenues from <LOCATION> Main </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Grasberg </PERSON> will begin to gush into the company's coffers. Securities analysts agreed. `` We think it's a good move to streamline operations,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranner </PERSON> of <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Weil </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Labouisse </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Friedrichs </ORGANIZATION>. `` They had to do something about debt.'' Low resource prices, plus high interest costs, depressed the company's earnings performance this year. Earnings fell from $ 3.35 a share in the first nine months of 1988 to $ 1.75 in the same period this year. Investors appeared only mildly impressed by the plan. <ORGANIZATION> Freeport-McMoRan </ORGANIZATION>, which reached a high of $ 38 a share in April, closed at $ 30.12 -LCB- Wednesday, up 50 cents. <ORGANIZATION> Freeport-McMoRan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the Main Pass sulfur deposit, closed at $ 20.50, up 50 cents, while <ORGANIZATION> Freeport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Copper </ORGANIZATION>, which is developing the Grasberg strike, rose 12.5 cents to $ 20.87 -LCB-.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillis </PERSON> says the supercomputer he is designing will be able to take complex problems that now require a year of calculations and solve them in a few hours. In addition, the machine would need just 1 second to perform 1 trillion mathematical operations _ such as additions or multiplications. `` You could tally up the national debt in 1 second,'' <PERSON> Hillis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hillis </PERSON> is co-founder and chief scientist of <ORGANIZATION> Thinking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>. The company announced this week it was getting $ 12 million from the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to develop a supercomputer that works 1,000 times faster than standard models now available and more than 100 times faster than the top machines. Thinking Machines said it was receiving the government money from the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Projects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which has been awarding grants aimed at keeping the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the world leader in high-speed supercomputers. <PERSON> Hillis </PERSON> said he expects the project to be completed by the mid-1990s, but his company hopes to have a smaller version ready to present to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> in 1992. Thinking Machines uses a process called parallel computing, in which smaller computers work separately to solve small pieces of bigger problems. The company's current models contain about 64,000 smaller computers, but the new machine could use up to 1 million processors. Other supercomputer makers, such as world leading <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, use parallel processing to a much smaller extent. Instead, they do large chunks of problems and work quickly from one facet to the next, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Trier </PERSON>, director of technical programs for <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consortium </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Minneapolis-based company that studies the supercomputer market for users and vendors. While machines that use parallel processing can do many calculations at once, they also are tailored more to solving specific problems and are less flexible in their uses, <PERSON> Trier </PERSON> said. Also, he said, some complex mathematical problems must be solved one step at a time and do not lend themselves to parallel processing. But <PERSON> Hillis </PERSON> said his company, which has been growing about 50 percent a year and provides computers for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, will produce machines that have many applications. For example, he said, the supercomputers can perform calculations in human genetics, can help design microchips and even simulate how a car will work before it is built. `` Some problems literally would take a year to do -LRB- on current computers -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Hillis </PERSON> said. `` If it takes a year to do, you might as well build the car.'' By contrast, the new computer would take only a few hours to solve such problems, he said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> plans to produce a record 412 million tons of grain next year as the state puts more land into cultivation and invests more in the countryside, Agriculture Minister He <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> said. He said at a meeting Wednesday that grain production will be up from an estimated harvest of 405 million tons this year, the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. He said the nation also hoped to produce up to 4.4 million tons of cotton next year, up from this year's output of about 4 million tons. Substantial gains are also planned in production of edible oils, meat and fishery products. The minister said 1.63 million acres of land will be put into grain production, making the total 272 million acres. Following a record grain harvest of 407 million tons in 1984, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has had four straight sub-standard crops, a result of poor weather and low state-set prices for grain that have discouraged production. Good weather has helped raise output this year, but the harvest will still fall short of the 1984 figure. Chinese agricultural experts say the nation must increase output by at least 10 million tons a year, to 500 million tons at the end of the decade, just to keep up with population growth.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> said it will issue a 200,000 zloty note on Friday, marking the third time this year that a new note has been created to keep pace with roaring inflation. The 200,000 zloty note will be worth $ 59 at the official exchange rate, or $ 29 at the commercial exchange rate now legally available to Poles. The bank said a 50,000 zloty note, which previously was to be issued before the end of the year, also will be put into circulation on Friday. When the bank issued 20,000 zloty notes nine months ago, inflation was running at 60 percent annually. The 20,000 zloty was $ 36 at the official exchange rate. The annual inflation rate is now estimated at about 700 percent, and food prices have rocketed since price controls were lifted Aug. 1 in a `` marketization'' program introduced by the previous communist government. The new 200,000 zloty note will have a panorama of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> on one side and an eagle, the national emblem, on the other, the bank communique said. Poles use large notes to pay cash for high-priced items such as cars, computers and televsion sets that can cost millions of zlotys.

 With the holiday season gearing up, a chocolate supplier is urging the federal government to avoid a chocolate shortage by temporarily lifting the import quota for non-fat dry milk. But the chocolate industry is running into opposition from dairy farmers, who contend that lifting the quota would cause domestic milk prices to plummet. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Leer </PERSON>, whose 40-year-old family business in <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, produces more than 30 million pounds of dark and milk chocolate each year, said the import limit for non-fat dry milk is 7,000 pounds a year. `` That's what we use in a day,'' said <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Leer </PERSON>, whose company supplies chocolate to <ORGANIZATION> Pepperidge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> cookies, Godiva chocolates and <ORGANIZATION> Ben </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>'s ice cream. Dry milk also is used in the production of dairy products like ice creams and cottage cheese. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Leer </PERSON> and another major chocolate supplier, M & amp; M Mars of <LOCATION> Hackettstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, have seen the price of non-fat dry milk skyrocket from about 85 cents a pound to as much as $ 2.50 a pound in October during a period of fall shortages. Prices have dipped closer to $ 2 more recently. On Nov. 6, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> seators and nine of its <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members appealed to <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> to suspend the quota and keep chocolate treats on the shelf this season. `` The fall is the busiest season for the chocolate manufacturing industry as it works to meet increased demand for holiday baking and gift-giving,'' the lawmakers wrote. `` Without non-fat dry milk, the availability of a wide variety of chocolate-based goods to the consumer will be restricted.'' As of Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> had provided no detailed response to the letter, said a spokesman for Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, whose office drafted the letter. Dairy farmers oppose any easing of restrictions, saying non-fat dry milk supplies have loosened in the last few weeks so that consumers will not face Christmas without their favorite chocolate desserts. `` We have sympathy with the chocolate industry,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>. `` We want people who use milk to make a living. But we do n't want the government to do silly things that are going to hurt the industry.'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Leer </PERSON> said this year's dry milk shortage has forced him to supply some of his chocolate at a loss because much of his chocolate sells at prices agreed upon months before shipping. `` We're hurt this season, but we're delivering on our commitments,'' said <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Leer </PERSON>, who has not yet tallied his loss. `` I have n't had the heart to measure it.'' Both the dairy farmers and chocolate producers agreed that something must be done year-round to stop American chocolate buyers from bypassing milk and sugar import restrictions by purchasing bulk chocolate from <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> producers. `` We're losing market share,'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Leer </PERSON> said. `` The real solution is to make those chocolates subject to the quotas for sugar and milk.''

 In Revolutionary times, every <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> neighborhood had its own brew pub, where a patron could stop for a pint of beer freshly brewed that day. Prohibition seemed to put an end to that, but now there's a place where someone again can watch beer tapped directly from the brewing tanks: the <ORGANIZATION> Samuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a collaboration of <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mink </PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Sansom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oyster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which brews <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> beer. A pleasant smell of brewing permeates the air, and the vats are enclosed behind a glass partition, readily seen by patrons. The tanks have a direct pipeline to the taps at the bar's counter. The beer `` comes all of five feet from the brewery to your glass,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said. `` Freshness is the key ingredient,'' said Mink. `` It makes such a difference.'' Of the bar's three traditional beers _ a golden ale, an amber, and a porter _ the porter drew the most raves from patrons at Wednesday's opening. Rightly so, since the beer took a silver medal last October at the Great American Beer Festival in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Pericles </PERSON>, the brewer. One patron, <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, described the dark brew _ `` pleasant with a rich, clean flavor.'' <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, a home brewer, said <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> once was known for its porters. `` It's a shame that the porters died out earlier in the century, but now we've got one back,'' he said. Another patron, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, was glad that brewing in general had returned. The city was a major brewing center through the 1800s, when a large influx of German immigrants brought their tradition with them. Most of the smaller brewers died out by the turn of the century. Even the major ones have died out; the last brewery, <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>'s, closed in 1987. Brew pubs started, like most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trends, in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, when that state eliminated Prohibition-era legislation banning such establishments, said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fink </PERSON>, staff member of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewers </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, Colo.-based research and marketing institution. The pubs do well in a variety of large cities like <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, but also are picking up in places like <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fink </PERSON> said. Plans are already under way to bring another brew pub to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. Brewmeister <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Ware </PERSON>, whose Dock Street Beer is brewed under contract in <LOCATION> Utica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, also has applied for a liquor license. Plans for the <ORGANIZATION> Dock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> include a 200-seat capacity, with a 40-foot bar and 10 copper brewing vats. Ware plans to brew five or six varieties _ including wheat beers in the summer, bock beers in the spring and heavier ale in the winter.

 Consumer spending fell 0.2 percent in October, its largest decline in nearly three years, despite a 0.9 percent gain in personal incomes, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The drop in consumer spending, reflecting plummeting auto sales, followed a 0.3 percent advance in September. But auto sales have continued to fall, foretelling continued sluggishness in the spending sector this quarter. Consumer spending is watched closely as a barometer of economic health because it accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's economic activity The reports provided fresh evidence that the economy is continuing to slow. As measured by the gross national product, the economy grew at a 2.7 percent rate in the third quarter, but analysts expect a sharp decline in the current three-month period that began in October. Personal income in October totaled $ 4.51 trillion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, following a 0.9 percent gain in September. It was the largest gain since a 1 percent advance last March. Although the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay-area </LOCATION> earthquake reduced incomes by about $ 21 billion at an annual rate in October, that decrease was offsetby increases in farm subsidies and bonus payments in the auto industry. Spending declined to an annual rate of $ 3.53 trillion after a 0.3 percent gain in September. It was the first decrease since a 0.1 percent dip in September 1988 and the largest drop since a 1.4 percent decrease in January 1987. The October report showed that Americans' incomes after taxes also rose 0.9 percent, up from September's 0.2 percent gain. Americans' savings rate, savings as a percent of disposable income, rose 5.7 percent, the highest since a 5.8 percent rate last June and up from September's 4.7 percent. The key component of the income category, wages and salaries, rose $ 33 billion last month following a gain of $ 17 billion in September. Payrolls at manufacturing companies rose by $ 6.8 billion, up from a September gain of $ 300 million. Personal incomes totaled $ 4.51 trillion at an annual rate in October, compared with $ 4.47 trillion in the previous month. On the spending side, the $ 6.1 billion decrease in personal consumption, which includes everything except interest payments on debt, contrasted to a $ 9.9 billion gain in September when auto sales were rising. Purchases of durable goods _ big-ticket items expected to last more than three years _ dropped $ 28.2 billion, while purchases of non-durable goods edged up $ 2.5 billion. Spending on services rose $ 20.2 billion.

 Grain and soybean futures prices were broadly higher this morning on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid indications that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> purchased 2 million to 4 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn overnight. The rumored buying, which was not confirmed, would be the first significant grain export deal in several weeks. It sparked a brisk rally in the grain markets, which have been in a downward trend due to the slack foreign demand. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> bought 8 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn in October for shipment in November and December, and was expected to buy more for January-March shipment. `` The question was when would they step in, and they stepped in overnight,'' said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Zusel </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s operations on the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> floor In early trading, wheat futures were unchanged to 1 \ cents higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.07 a bushel; corn futures were 1 -RCB- cents to 4 cents higher with December at $ 2.38 -RCB- a bushel; oats were -RCB- cent to 1 -LCB- cents higher with December at $ 1.43 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 3 \ cents to 5 -LCB- cents higher with January at $ 5.84 -RCB- a Livestock futures were mostly higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> while pork-belly futures extended their sharp decline into a third day, reflecting disappointment over the slow pace of the government's purchase of pork bellies for shipment to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Live cattle futures were unchanged to .05 cent higher with December at 75.27 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .30 cent higher with November at 83.90 cents a pound; live hogs were .03 cent to .28 cent higher with December at 50.72 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .02 cent to 1.50 cents lower with February at 59.05 cents a pound. Frozen pork bellies settled sharply lower on Wednesday, leading the livestock markets down.

<HEAD>Baby Food Maker To Close Canadian Plant By April</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FREMONT, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Gerber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it will close its <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, plant by April, terminating about 150 jobs. The world's largest baby food maker is consolidating production in its three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plants, in <LOCATION> Fremont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Smith </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Asheville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Gerber </ORGANIZATION> Chairman and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. Except for two or three supervisory personnel who may be transferred, employees at the Canadian plant will be dismissed, <ORGANIZATION> Gerber </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poole </PERSON> said. Production is to be transferred to the Fremont plant, with some product lines being moved immediately and some during the coming months, <PERSON> Poole </PERSON> said. Dismissals are not expected to begin until early in 1990, he said. <PERSON> Poole </PERSON> said employees will receive help in finding other jobs as well as a severance package including two weeks' pay per year of service, twice what <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> law requires. Those costs will mean a charge of $ 4.5 million, or 12 cents a share, against earnings for <PERSON> Gerber </PERSON>'s third quarter ending Dec. 31, the company said. That would cut third-quarter earnings projected at 58 cents a share, or about $ 21.8 million, before the change, to 46 cents a share, or $ 17.3 million. Gerber reported earnings of $ 19.1 million, or 48 cents a share, for its 1988 third quarter. For its fiscal year ended March 31, <ORGANIZATION> Gerber </ORGANIZATION> reported profits of $ 81.4 million, or $ 4.13 a share, on sales of $ 1.07 billion. <PERSON> Gerber </PERSON> has about 70 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> baby food market and about 25 percent of the Canadian market. It still will pursue Canadian sales, offering its full U.S.-produced array of 184 products rather than just the 94 produced at the <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> plant, <PERSON> Poole </PERSON> said. He said studies that led to closing the <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> plant were based on conditions prior to the U.S.-Canadian free trade agreement adopted this year, and the plant would have been closed with or without the agreement. In addition to baby food, Gerber markets infant and children's wear under the <PERSON> Gerber </PERSON>, <PERSON> Buster </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and Weather Tamer labels The company employs nearly 15,000 people.

<TEXT>
 For more than a century the name <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> commanded respect as a maker of top-quality weapons and a flagship of Swedish industry. When scandals rocked <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION>, all of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> trembled. <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> has become synonymous with corruption in the murky world of the international arms trade. Its questioned dealings with Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> helped bring him down in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s recent elections. A trial of three former <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> executives has exposed evidence of foul play in the corridors of power. The corruption charges have deflated the faith many Swedes had in the honesty of their leadership. Two affairs concerning <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> were uncovered in the last five years: _ <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> was accused of paying up to $ 50 million in bribes to secure a 1986 contract to sell $ 1.4 billion in artillery guns to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> executives were tried on charges of violating export restrictions in 1979-81 to sell advanced surface-to-air missiles to <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> countries by using <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> as an intermediary The verdict is due Dec. 22. Other arms manufacturers have been implicated in other cases of alleged unauthorized sales. <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Borje </PERSON> <PERSON> Johanson </PERSON>, a former army lieutenant colonel, said <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> now is `` playing strictly by the book'' and concentrating on `` delivering good products and fullfilling contracts.'' Unethical deals `` will not exist,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> does not see itself as just another Swedish company. In the entrance to the company's elegant headquarters hangs a portrait of <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobel </PERSON>, the benefactor of the Nobel prizes who once owned <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> is <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s largest weapons manufacturer and belongs to the <ORGANIZATION> Nobel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, one of the powerhouses of Swedish industry. Though privately owned, <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> operates almost like a government company. Production is tuned to the needs of the Swedish military and exports are severly restricted according to regulations forbidding sales to countries in conflict or in volatile regions. This country of only 8.4 million people produces supersonic warplanes, submarines, and surface battle ships. Bofors alone makes a range of artillery, missiles, air defense systems and explosives. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> says it needs an independent arms industry and strong defense to give teeth to its neutrality and avoid entanglements with any military alliance. Each foreign sale must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Materials </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, a government agency, under a strict set of rules. At their 10-week trial, the former <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> directors admitted skirting the export restrictions by selling the equipment to <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. But they claimed they were innocent of criminal activity because the government tacitly approved the sales. One of the defense attorneys, <PERSON> Goran </PERSON> <PERSON> Ekdahl </PERSON>, said a system of tacit agreements had been practiced for 20 years because the government wanted to avoid an open debate about where its weaponry was being used. Government officials and former ministers denied knowing the weapons were being sold to blacklisted countries. But testimony and documents showed that the security police and at least some officials were informed and took no action to stop the sales. In 1987, when the affairs were being scrutinized, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Material </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Algernon </PERSON>, fell in front of a subway train, in what police ruled was an apparent suicide. <PERSON> Gunnar </PERSON> <PERSON> Adler-Karlsson </PERSON>, an economics professor, author and social critic, said he believed top government officials were lying in the Bofors case. `` I can not prove it, but it is absolutely clear as far as I am concerned, that all ministers of trade and war material inspectors understood that what was officially going to <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, absolutely would not stay in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Adler-Karlsson </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION>' image problems were compounded by its handling of the bribery accusations in the Indian howitzer contract. <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> denied the allegations but rejected demands from <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> opposition leaders to open its books. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> also denied that any Indian had received kickbacks or commissions. But he resigned last week after his <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> failed to win a majority in national elections that focused on charges of corruption and ineptitude. <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> officials said they were intent on riding out the storm, because it was a matter of company ethics not to reveal classifed parts of a business contract. `` We can not contradict the wish of the customer, or the contracts we have signed, and go out and reveal the content of various agreements,'' said <PERSON> Johanson </PERSON>, the company spokesman. `` If we did, it would mean that in the long run, we and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> could n't sign agreements and be trusted that this is an issue between buyer and seller,'' he said.

 Business is booming in business class. In the competitive airline industry, many big carriers are racing to cash in on the growing popularity of business class, which is more expensive than economy but cheaper than first class. Business class is found mainly on international flights. It has grown as business has become more globalized, boosting air travel abroad. `` It reflects the amount of international business that's happening,'' said <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>, editor and publisher of Frequent, a monthly newsletter published in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>. Jet-powered executives look for service, comfort and more space to work in as they shuttle between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> And their companies are willing to pay extra for them to arrive in better shape. A lot extra. A business class ticket from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, for example, costs around $ 1,400 to $ 1,500 one way, compared with an economy fare of $ 450 to $ 865. First class, which provides even more pampering than the business cabins, is the steepest: $ 2,400 to $ 2,800 one way for the same flight. In return, business class passengers get separate check-in counters and special lounges at airports, and separate cabins in the air with wider seats, fancier food, free liquor and other amenities. They also get a lot more attention than passengers in the cramped coach section: the ratio of flight attendants to fliers increases from economy to business to first. Who flies in business class? <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> says about 80 percent of its business fliers are men, mainly business executives, with an average income of more than $ 80,000 a year. They average 11 airline trips per year, two of which are international. Some big <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines, aiming to capitalize on the business class boom, are emulating foreign carriers with strong reputations for international service. United, for example, recently announced that it is spending more than $ 45 million to upgrade its business class service, in what it calls the largest renovation program in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline history. <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, whose revenue from business class has jumped 106 percent in the past year, spent $ 40 million on an upgrade program in early 1988. `` Business class customers are very important to our international air travel business,'' <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said in launching the improvement program. `` These new enhancements will give our international service a strong competitive edge.'' Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> offers business class on its flights to and from the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> _ the world's longest hauls, where comfort becomes even more important. Its flight from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, for example, takes 14 hours and 40 minutes. Business class accounted for around $ 390 million of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 8.9 billion in revenue in 1988 The airline plans to include the service on its new flights to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> next spring. Some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines are catching up with big foreign carriers in the international service game, said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, director of industry relations for the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Passengers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where the airlines have been deregulated since 1978, cheap fares and reduced labor costs have been emphasized more than service. Carriers in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, on the other hand, still operate mainly under government control of fares and routes. Closer to home, only <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> offer business class to any significant extent on domestic <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flights _ notably on coast-to-coast flights, which use bigger jets. The smaller, narrow-body jets used for most domestic flights are difficult to divide up into three sections, so the majority of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flights offer only economy and first class. In addition, many companies will pay for employees to fly business class on long overseas trips but will limit them to economy on domestic flights. <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>, which gets 12 percent to 13 percent of its revenue from business class and advertises its service aggressively, provides it on many flights from its <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> hub as well as on transcontinental and international trips. `` We saw a niche to fill,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. As an inducement to passengers, its domestic business class often costs only slightly more than economy. <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s one-way business class fare from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, for example, is $ 411, compared with $ 391 in coach and $ 670 in first class. <ORGANIZATION> Rival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> offers passengers on transcontinental flights a business class ticket at the same price as a full economy fare: $ 588 one way from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. A fair number of business class fliers pay less than the full fare because they fly a lot. Around 20 percent to 30 percent of business class passengers are flying on bonus upgrades from coach accrued in frequent flier programs, Frequent editor <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> estimates.

<HEAD>Ford To Close Engine Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDSOR, Ontario (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it will close an engine plant at the end of 1990, eliminating 900 jobs. The announcement to halt engine and stamping production at Engine Plant 2 in <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION> was expected since no product had been allocated for the 67-year-old plant past the end of next year. The Canadian Auto Workers recently urged <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> to make a decision on the plant's future to allow workers to look for other jobs. The plant also was shut down in 1981 during a slump in the automotive industry, but it was temporarily reactived in 1983 to meet increased demand for the five-liter V-8 engine. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has been telling workers for the last few years that there is no production planned for the plant at the end of 1990, said <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s Windsor engine plants. The city has two other <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> engine plants, a casting plant and an aluminum plant. The number of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> cars using the five-liter engine has declined and some have been replaced by the 3.8-litre engine, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Man Held in Alleged Plot To Kidnap Texas Billionaire</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A man was held Thursday on racketeering and extortion charges for an alleged plot to kidnap <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> billionaire <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> and hold him for $ 5 million ransom, authorities said. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Veleff </PERSON>, 57, of <LOCATION> Germantown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, was arrested by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents Wednesday after he had driven to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> with an undercover agent he thought was going to help him. The arrest came after <PERSON> Veleff </PERSON> took pictures of City Place, a 33-story office complex built by the Bass family where <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> has his office. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Andre </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Veleff </PERSON> had never met Bass and had no connection with him. He had made Bass the target of a kidnapping after reading about him in a business magazine, <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> said. Federal authorities had been aware of the alleged plot since May. But <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> said <PERSON> Veleff </PERSON> told the undercover agent he had been planning to abduct Bass for seven years. <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, a lawyer for the Bass family, declined to comment. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Fallin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, the agent in charge of the investigation, said <PERSON> Veleff </PERSON> planned to ask for $ 5 million ransom after taking Bass to south <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Veleff, an advertising salesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Memphis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> newspaper for about 20 years, had operated a swimming pool business for about eight years before becoming unemployed. If convicted, <PERSON> Veleff </PERSON> could face a maximum prison term of five years and a fine of up to $ 250,000. <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> said that in addition to the $ 5 million ransom Veleff talked about filming Bass `` in distressing situations'' and seeking an additional $ 20 million after the initial ransom had been delivered by plane to a mountain in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The alleged plot called for a pilot to be informed to drop the money on a specified mountain about 45 miles south of border, <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> said. Bass, 41, has a reported wealth of $ 1.44 billion, according to <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> magazine. His brothers, <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON>, 46; <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON>, 33; and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON>, 44, also are reported billionaires. The Bass family's business interests include oil, gas and various investments.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar was mixed against the major foreign currencies Thursday in thin European trading, dealers said. Gold prices declined. After little movement, the dollar fell sharply late in the day on rumors that <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> was resigning because of his one-time consulting role with a troubled savings and loan association. A denial by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> helped steady the dollar, but dealers said a large order hitting the market at the same time as the rumors added to the quick, sharp decline. There was brief dollar buying early in the day after the assassination of <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON>, traders said. They said the buying focused on the potentially destabilizing effect a new wave of terrorism would have on <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and its economy. Dealers said the end of the month trading was very thin, giving smaller orders greater impact on prices. `` No one wants to be adventurous on the last day of the month,'' said one <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> corporate dealer. `` The market wo n't be too lively now,'' he said, predicting the markets would remain quiet until the end of the year. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar fell 0.45 yen from Wednesday's close of 143.35 yen to a closing 142.90 Japanese yen. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound rose to $ 1.5700 from $ 1.5655 late Wednesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday's prices, included: 1.7800 West German mark, down from 1.7825; 1.5910 Swiss francs, up from 1.5895; 6.0725 French francs, down from 6.0810; 2.0150 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0100; 1,311.50 Italian lire, down from 1,315.50; 1.1632 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1658. Gold fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 410.60 a troy ounce, down from $ 412.50 late Wednesday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the metal fell to a closing bid of $ 409.50, down from $ 411.70 late Wednesday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 5.59 to close at a bid $ 405.76. Silver fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 5.64 a troy ounce, down from $ 5.65 late Wednesday.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that its net profit jumped 19 percent in its fiscal half-year, boosted by growing sales in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and abroad. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest manufacturer of electric and electronic products said its net profit rose to 101.2 billion yen, or around $ 723 million, in the six months ended Sept. 30 from 84.9 billion yen, or $ 607 million, a year earlier. Per-share earnings increased to 31.71 yen, or 23 cents, from 27.40 yen, or 20 cents, in the same period a year earlier. Half-year sales rose 12 percent to 3.485 trillion yen, or $ 24.9 billion, from 3.117 trillion yen, or $ 22.3 billion. Overseas sales jumped 10 percent to 786 billion yen, or $ 5.6 billion, accounting for 23 percent of total sales. Consumer products were the only division that registered a decline in sales, <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> said. They dipped 4 percent to 486.4 billion yen, or $ 3.5 billion. Company officials said air conditioners did n't sell well in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> because of cool weather in early summer this year. In addition, they said, sales of color televisions were adversely affected by the political repression in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and camcorder sales turned sluggish under the pressure of intensifying price competition. For the full fiscal year, <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> anticipates net profit of around 210 billion yen, or $ 1.5 billion, up from 185.5 billion yen, or $ 1.32 billion, a year earlier. The company expects full-year sales to rise to an estimated 7 trillion yen, or $ 50 billion, from 6.40 trillion yen, or $ 45.7 billion.

<HEAD>Corn and Soybean Futures Mostly Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Corn and soybean futures prices closed mostly higher Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid indications the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> bought 2 million to 4 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn. Wheat futures ended mostly lower as some traders simultaneously sold wheat and bought corn. The rumored Soviet buying, which was not confirmed, would represent the first significant grain export deal in several weeks. It sparked a brisk rally in the corn and soybean markets at the opening bell. But prices closed below their opening levels, perhaps reflecting an overriding bearish sentiment. Considering the size of the rumored Soviet purchase, `` the market did n't act all that well,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> bought 8 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn in October for shipment in November and December, and was expected to buy more for shipment in January through March. In early trading, wheat futures were 2 \ cents lower to 2 cents higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.07 -RCB- a bushel; corn futures were \ cent lower to 3 -LCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.38 \ a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 -LCB- cents higher with December at $ 1.42 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 3 \ cents to 4 cents higher with January at $ 5.82 -RCB-

 Thirty-three congressmen urged President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday to give priority in his talks with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to ending a rule that imposes high <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tariffs on imports from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has power to waive the Jackson-Vanik amendment, a provision in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade law that denies the Soviets the `` most favored nation'' status because of limits on emigration. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> already have the status. `` The Soviet government has come a long way in addressing the concerns we have long expressed,'' the congressmen said in a letter to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as he was leaving for the talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. `` Assuming you are assured of continued Soviet progress, it is now time to recognize and reward Soviet progress with a waiver under Jackson-Vanik,'' they said. At the end of August, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had allowed more than 96,000 of its citizens to leave, more than in any entire year for the past two decades. The letter was signed six senators, including Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, and 27 House members. All are Democrats except for six <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members. Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who last June introduced a resolution supporting a waiver once <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> received assurances on free emigration from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The Supreme Soviet is expected to complete action in January on a bill to free emigration. The lower tariffs would only take effect after Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials negotiate a trade accord. It was agreed earlier this month to create working parties that would start work on the agreement, but <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorokin </PERSON>, economic counselor at the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, said on Thursday that they have not yet met. Formal negotiations are expected to start later and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials say they would take several months, after which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would issue the waiver.

 <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it has received British government approval to redevelop the <LOCATION> Piper </LOCATION> oil field in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, where an explosion on a company platform killed 167 men. The Piper Alpha platform off <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> exploded in flames on July 6, 1988, and was destroyed. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Piper </LOCATION> field will be redeveloped with a production platform designed to handle up to 140,000 barrels of oil per day and accommodate up to 24 wells. Within the next few days, a 200-ton underwater drilling template will be installed at the location of the new platform to allow up to six wells to be pre-drilled, <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> shut down all its <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> production after the explosion.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday said more than 90 percent of the regular employees who are being cut by the end of the year are leaving voluntarily with special benefits rather than through layoffs. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> said it expected to trim 4,500 to 5,000 jobs by the end of 1989, up slightly from a previous estimate of 4,500. About 80 percent are regular employees. The rest are temporary or supplemental employees who are being cut without special incentives. The job cuts are apart from reductions in employment due to divestitures of businesses. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> is cutting jobs as part of a plan announced in August to generate up to $ 1 billion in operating cash flow during 1990.

<HEAD>Sikorsky To Lay Off About 150, Citing Military Spending Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STRATFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Sikorsky </PERSON> <PERSON> Aircraft </PERSON> said it will lay off about 150 hourly workers Friday in part because of shrinking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and international defense spending. The layoffs, announced Wednesday in a notice posted at four company plants in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, will be the first in Sikorsky's blue-collar work force since February 1988, when the helicopter builder laid off 19 hourly workers Sikorsky, a division of Hartford-based <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, laid off 350 salaried workers in July, a 6 percent cut in its salaried ranks. `` This employee reduction must be made to remain competitive in the face of shrinking worldwide defense budgets in the years to come,'' Sikorsky Vice President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpino </PERSON> said in the notice. He also said that `` future production of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military helicopters will be reduced below anticipated levels despite strong Congressional support for Sikorsky's programs during the current budget cycle.'' <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Demish </PERSON>, a defense industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> UBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the company will likely be forced to consider further reductions. `` To the extent that there's a relaxation of military tensions worldwide, the demand for military helicopters worldwide is going down. Sikorsky remains at risk of further cuts,'' he said. The layoffs will leave Sikorsky with a total work force of about 12,650, including 6,550 hourly workers, company spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON> said. The notice said <PERSON> Sikorsky </PERSON> will continue to assess employment levels in light of its projected work load. <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON> declined to say if the company expects further layoffs. `` I do n't think many people are projecting an increase in the defense budget, either in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or internationally, in the years to come,'' he said. Although it has tried to boost sales of its commercial helicopter, the S-76, more than 80 percent of Sikorsky's sales continue to be military. The company also has been pushing foreign sales of its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aircraft. Foreign sales represented only 6 percent of the company's sales five years ago but are expected to represent 25 percent this year, <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON> said.

 Stock prices rallied in moderate trading today, after new economic indicators raised investor hopes for lower interest rates.

 Energy futures prices rallied Thursday paced by strong demand for wholesale home heating oil. Analysts said heavy buying in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s heating oil market spilled over into <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading pits. The onset of colder temperatures throughout much of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also has boosted demand. The contract for December delivery of No. 2 heating oil surged 2.10 cents to 62.71 cents a gallon after rising 0.30 cent on Wednesday It was the last trading day for the December contract and some of the buying may have been tied to the expiration. The January contract, which becomes the nearest-month contract on Friday, gained 1.77 cents to 61.81 cents a gallon. The February and March contracts ended with slightly smaller increases. Among other refined petroleum products traded on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Merc </LOCATION>, wholesale unleaded gasoline for December delivery finished 0.57 cent higher at 50.29 cents a gallon, adding to Wednesday's increase of 0.19 cent The January contract, which will replace the expired December contract on Friday, pushed ahead 0.71 cent to 51.35. Contracts for later delivery posted larger gains. The January contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, added 49 cents to close at $ 19.89 per 42-gallon barrel. The contract had gone up 15 cents on Wednesday. Contracts for delivery in February through April finished with slighter greater gains. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Redoglia </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s energy trading division said: `` The strength of this market stemmed from the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> gas-oil market.'' He said the demand in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> exceeded normal seasonal increases and carried the gas-oil contract _ the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> equivalent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> heating oil _ past psychologically significant levels. A belief that winter weather has finally arrived to stay after an abnormally mild autumn also has lifted heating oil futures lately, he said. Energy traders continued to mull the implications of an <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> agreement reached earlier this week at the cartel's winter conference. The feeling remained oil prices could be weighed down by the pact raising the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' self-imposed daily production limit. Ministers from the cartel's 13 members agreed to raise their output ceiling to 22 million barrels for the first half of next year from the current 20.5 million barrels.

 <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s latest move on <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> sent the company's stock climbing Thursday, but analysts say the takeover strategist's plans regarding the energy and steel giant are no clearer than they were before. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, who owns <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, has indicated several times in recent years that he might acquire a substantial stake in <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION>. But he has made an actual public buyout offer only once _ and that was dropped following rejection by the <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> board. `` I'm not sure whether this is a mountain or a molehill,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>, vice president of steel consulting for AUS Consultants in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s disclosure Wednesday that he was requesting federal approval to acquire at least 25 percent of Pittsburgh-based corporation was `` just something he had to do to keep his options open.'' <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Drahuschak </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Butcher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Singer in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, said he has `` serious doubts'' <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> would try to take over <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's no way you'll make me believe he wants to run the company,'' <PERSON> Drahuschak </PERSON> said. `` It's the capital commitment that would be required. ... We're talking serious money.'' Based on its roughly 257.5 million outstanding common shares, <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> has a market value of some $ 8.8 billion. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> stock rose 75 cents to $ 34.37 -LCB- Thursday in active <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s latest filing could be an attempt to prod <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Corry </PERSON> to speed up restructuring or sell major assets, analysts said. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> long has advocated a spinoff of <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION>'s steel division, formerly known as <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION>, as a way to boost shareholder values. `` Is he waving a paper tiger before <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> again? Is he asking for a divestiture of its oil and gas properties? We do n't know,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON>, director of research at <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> is seeking antitrust clearance from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to increase his <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> stake. According to a filing Wednesday with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> owned nearly 34 million, or 13.26 percent, of <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding common shares. A <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> spokesman declined comment Thursday except to say <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> made similar requests in late 1987 and late 1988 but never boosted his stake to the amount requested in the allotted year. <PERSON> Corry </PERSON> said Wednesday that he had a long telephone conversation with <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> last Friday and <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> gave no indication what he planned to do with the stock. `` He said once again that he thought the company's stock would perform better if we did n't have holdings in steel and oil. He wants one or the other,'' <PERSON> Corry </PERSON> told reporters following a speech. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> was in meetings Thursday, his secretary said. He did not immediately return a phone call to his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office seeking comment. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> made a $ 7.19 billion, or $ 31 a share, offer for <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> in early 1987 but dropped the proposal after the <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> board rejected it. When he made his bid, there was speculation he only wanted to drive up the stock price and profit from it, but he did not sell his shares when he abandoned the offer. `` I think one of the reasons <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> bought into the business is he felt the breakup value of the pieces are greater than the value of the whole,'' <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> said. `` I think that's why <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> continues to be a speculative stock candidate.'' <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON>, senior analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, value <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> stock at less than $ 30 a share. But <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> said the stock might be worth nearly $ 50 a share if assets are sold and proceeds go to shareholders.

The terrorist <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility. <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON> was a friend and economic adviser to Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, who was in tears over the murder. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> often sought <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON>'s advice and asked the banker to accompany him on several foreign trips. <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON>'s voice, articulating a clear vision of the need for expansion and new fields of business, was the most influential in the business circles of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s largest exporting nation. `` He was a towering presence in the international financial community,'' <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schreyer </PERSON> said in a statement in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` Mr. <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON> combined warmth of character with consummate banking skills and en extraordinary vision of world affairs.'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> is not without a head, but it will be without a brilliant voice for a while,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Albrecht </PERSON>, an analyst with <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> UBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drew </ORGANIZATION>, the brokerage unit of the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Switzerland </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON> had expanded the reach of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s largest bank throughout <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and was broadening the bank's securities and corporate finance business in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Under <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON>, the Frankfurt-based <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> has been expanding aggressively in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, preparing for a leading role as the Common Market moves toward a barrier-free internal market of 1992. Efforts to gain a foothold in investment banking culminated this week in the $ 640 million takeover bid for the British investment bank <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grenfell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> has also acquired major operating interests in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, and was one of the first West German companies to be quoted on the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> stock exchange. His next goal was <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, although he had words of caution for West German businesses seeking to expand in the reform-minded countries of the Soviet bloc. <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON> repeatedly had called for a restructuring of the massive debts of Third World nations. During Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> in June, <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON> said it could take 20 years or more for the outmoded Soviet economy to achieve Western standards. He put the time at five to 10 years for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON> engineered the largest industrial restructuring in West German history, the merger of <ORGANIZATION> Daimler-Benz </ORGANIZATION> with aerospace giant <ORGANIZATION> Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm </ORGANIZATION>. He used the bank's 28 percent share in the country's No. 1 conglomerate, <ORGANIZATION> Daimler-Benz </ORGANIZATION>, to push the behemoth behind cars and trucks into electronics, aerospace and even outer space ventures. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON>'s sense of social responsiblity, perhaps a reflection of the bank chief's lifelong devotion to philosophy. <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON> was concerned by the public's lack of knowledge about the huge financial deals taking place in the bank's twin glimmering towers overlooking <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and brought in a former radio executive to improve communication with ordinary citizens. `` Abroad, <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON> was one of the shining examples of German management,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiessle </PERSON>, a banking analyst with the Berliner Handels-und <ORGANIZATION> Frankfurter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. `` As such, he was an exceptional figure who can not be replaced.'' <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON> was born on Jan. 30, 1930, in <LOCATION> Essen </LOCATION> in the grimy Ruhr industrial area and attended a Bavarian school, called the <LOCATION> Napola </LOCATION>, set up by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> for gifted children. He graduated from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cologne </ORGANIZATION> with a degree in economics and business and later received a doctorate in economics. <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON> originally pursued a career in industry, working as a manager at <ORGANIZATION> Ruhrgas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s largest gas company. He also worked as board member at <ORGANIZATION> Vereinigte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elektrizitaetswerke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>, a power company. In 1969, he was recruited by the <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, where he worked in the economics department and in its important North American operations. He become co-chairman in 1985 and the sole chairman in 1988. He is survived by a wife and two daughters.

<TEXT>
 The dollar was mostly lower in light trading Thursday amid more signs of a slowing economy. Gold prices were mixed. The dollar fell in response to a <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report that personal income rose 0.9 percent in October and rumors that purchasing executives in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> believed the economy was weakening, said <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, a currency market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> MMS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Both developments `` did n't contradict the idea that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy continued to slow down,'' <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said. When the economy slows, financial markets expect the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to nudge interest rates lower. Declining rates make the dollar less attractive, and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency tends to fall when yields decline. The dollar also slipped as traders who had taken profits against the West German mark in recent days began to rebuild their positions, <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said. The dollar fell to 1.7815 marks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from 1.7875 late Wednesday after dropping earlier in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> to 1.7800 marks from late Wednesday's 1.7825. Volume was light as many traders awaited two economic figures to be released Friday, the government's Index of Leading Indicators and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Purchasing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>'s monthly assessment of the economy. `` Right now, dollar sentiment is so poor, we really need some strong fundamental data in order for it to rally,'' <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said. Overseas dealers said the dollar fell sharply late in the day on rumors that <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> was resigning because of his one-time consulting role with the troubled <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Coyne </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the rumors were `` absolutely not true,'' and the denial helped steady the dollar somewhat. There was brief dollar buying early in the day after the assassination of <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON>, the overseas traders said. They said the buying focused on the potentially destabilizing effect a new wave of terrorism would have on <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and its economy. Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday's quotes, included: 1.5930 Swiss francs, up from 1.5920; 6.0840 French francs, down from 6.0935; 1,312.25 Italian lire, down from 1,318.75; and 1.16405 Canadian dollars, down from 1.16525 The dollar lost ground against the British pound. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, sterling rose to $ 1.5700 from late Wednesday's $ 1.5678, and in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the pound rose to $ 1.5700 from $ 1.5655. The dollar also fell against the Japanese yen, declining to 142.80 yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from 142.825 late Wednesday. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar fell to 142.90 yen from 143.35 yen, and it was unchanged in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at 143.15 yen. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday's prices, included: 1.5910 Swiss francs, up from 1.5895; 6.0725 French francs, down from 6.0810; 2.0150 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0100; 1,311.50 Italian lire, down from 1,315.50; 1.1632 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1658. Gold prices rose in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading after falling overseas. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a troy ounce of gold rose $ 2.10 to $ 411.60 on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> quoted a late bid of $ 410.65 for a troy ounce, up $ 2.95. Gold fell earlier in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 410.60 a troy ounce, down from $ 412.50 late Wednesday.

<TEXT>
 The three broadest measures of the nation's money supply rose in the week ended Nov. 20, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 791.0 billion from $ 785.0 billion the previous week. The measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,200.2 billion from $ 3,193.4 billion. An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 4,049.8 billion from $ 4,045.9 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In judging its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures. The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 4.2 percent, which is within the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s target range of 3 percent to 7 percent. The annual growth rate in M3 is 3.9 percent, which is within the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has not set a target for M1 growth since early 1987. For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $ 3,169.8 billion, an 8.0 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13 weeks. M3 averaged $ 4,024.1 billion, up 3.4 percent, while M1 rose 5.0 percent to an average of $ 784.5 billion. In other reports: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said bank borrowings from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> at the discount window, excluding extended credit, averaged $ 656 million a day in the week ended Nov. 29, up sharply from $ 182 million the previous week _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> reported that the monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation, was $ 292.4 billion in the two-week period ended Nov. 29, down from $ 294.8 billion two weeks earlier

<HEAD>Pork Bellies Fall Limit for Third Straight Day</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Pork belly futures prices plunged the permitted daily limit for the third straight day Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as traders disappointed by the low level of exports fled the collapsing market. Livestock futures finished mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>. On other commodity markets, gold futures rebounded after three days of losses; energy futures rallied; and grains and soybeans were mostly higher. Frozen pork belly futures settled .40 cent to the limit 2 cents lower with the contract for delivery in February down 2 cents at 58.55 cents a pound. In livestock trading, live cattle futures settled .05 cent to .25 cent lower with December at 74.97 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .20 cent lower with January at 82.62 cents a pound; live hogs were .13 cent to .33 cent higher with December at 50.85 cents a pound. The February pork belly contract has lost more 6 cents, or 9.6 percent of its value so far this week after rising sharply during the past two months amid the excitement surrounding the political changes occurring in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The rally got its start with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's pledge of food aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> _ a package that was to include up to 20 million pounds of pork bellies, the part of the hog from which bacon is made. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s purchase of 150,000 pounds of bellies in late October helped the rally along, as did indications that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was interested in buying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bellies. `` All of a sudden it seemed like we were going to be sending bellies all over the world,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` But if you get the price up high enough, everyone backs away.'' The government has purchased a paltry 1.2 million pounds of bellies so far and a <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> report on Tuesday showed bellies piling up in commercial freezers at a rapid pace _ an indication of slack demand for bacon. Analysts said the sell-off was inevitable after so strong a rally. The market had recorded two consecutive days of limit gains on Oct. 31 and Nov. 1. `` When something goes up the way this market did, it's going to come down the same way,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Durchholz </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> AgriVisor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, Ill. Precious metals prices rebounded on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, taking back some of the ground lost Wednesday. The gold market, which had fallen for the three previous sessions, posted modest gains on buying by bargain hunters and speculators whose interest was piqued by the weaker dollar and the rise in oil prices. Gold futures settled $ 2.10 to $ 2.70 higher with December at $ 411.60 a troy ounce; silver was 5.9 cents to 6.8 cents higher with December at $ 5.668 a troy ounce. Surging demand for heating oil drove energy futures up sharply on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 21 cents to 52 cents higher with January at $ 19.89 a barrel; heating oil was .65 cent to 2.10 cents higher with the December contract expiring at 62.71 a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .57 cent to 1.10 cents higher with the expiring December contract at 50.29 cents a gallon. Corn and soybean futures prices ended mostly higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid indications the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> bought 2 million to 4 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn. After the close, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced sales of 1.4 million metric tons of corn and 150,000 metric tons of soybean meal to the Soviets. Wheat futures settled 2 cents lower to 1 -RCB- cents higher with December at $ 4.07 -LCB- a bushel; corn futures were unchanged to 3 -LCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.38 \ a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 -LCB- cents higher with December at $ 1.42 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents to 4 -LCB- cents higher with January at $ 5.82 -RCB- a bushel

 The stock market rallied behind a strengthening bond market Thursday, reflecting investor confidence that interest rates are headed lower. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 17.49 points to finish at 2,706.27. It was the highest closing since Oct. 12, the day before the stock market plunged 190 points, when the blue-chip indicator finished at 2,759.84. Advancing issues outpaced decliners by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 837 issues up, 629 down and 516 unchanged. While blue-chips issues were strong, however, the secondary market continued to languish, traders said. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 153.20 million shares, up from 147.27 million in the previous session. Wall Street analysts said the market rallied on renewed optimism that interest rates are headed lower. Equities took their cue from firming bond prices after new economic data pointed to a slowdown in fourth-quarter economic growth. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that consumer spending fell 0.2 percent in October despite a 0.9 percent rise in personal incomes. Another report by the <ORGANIZATION> Purchasing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> showed a decline in a Chicago-area economic index for November to 49.1 percent from 51.7 percent. Analysts said that set the tone for the purchasing agents' nationwide survey due out on Friday. `` The bond market responded very well in expectation of the purchasing agency figures which supposedly are lower than in recent months,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, chief technical analyst for <ORGANIZATION> MKI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. A slower economy would point to further credit easing by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> despite its mixed signals in recent days `` Anything that allows the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to ease is good news for the stock market, which is bad economic news,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>, chief equities analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Oil stocks added a firm tone to the market, while bank stocks remained under pressure amid interest rate worries and concern about leveraged buyout loans New federal regulations require banks to report loans for buyouts, acquisitions and recapitalizations. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 184.94 million shares. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market rose $ 16.368 billion, or 0.49 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks closed up 1.05 at 191.30.

<HEAD>Anheuser-Busch Rolls Out New Non-Alcoholic Brew</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that it is increasing the availability of its non-alcoholic beer just in time for the holiday season. `` There are many situations where a non-alcohol malt beverage might be preferred, such as during business lunches or while participating in athletic events,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Merz </PERSON>, group brand director for <PERSON> O'Doul </PERSON>'s Non-Alcoholic Brew. `` And with the holidays just around the corner, it might also be preferred when consumers know they will be driving,'' he said. <PERSON> O'Doul </PERSON>'s has been test-marketed since March in cities in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. It will be made available in December in all or part of 12 other states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest brewery, is one of several breweries that have recently introduced non-alcoholic beers. Milwaukee-based <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, for instance, announced plans in October to offer its Sharp's non-alcoholic brew for sale nationwide by Jan. 1. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Krishock </PERSON>, new products category director for <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, said growth in the non-alcoholic beer market prompted <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> to bring <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>'s out nationwide without test marketing. Annual <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production of non-alcoholic beers is about a million barrels a year, compared with the national beer market of more than 182 million barrels. But the non-alcoholic segment is growing at the rate of 10 percent to 15 percent a year while the overall beer market has been stable, analysts said. The introduction of non-alcoholic beers is seen as a response to a growing anti-drinking sentiment as well as to offset sluggish beer sales with a wider variety of products. `` It has been our marketing philosophy to present the beer consumer with a broad range of alternatives in terms of beer tastes and beer types,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roarty </PERSON>, executive vice president and director of marketing for <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION>, the brewing arm of <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> O'Doul </PERSON>'s would be available beginning Dec. 4 in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <PERSON> O'Doul </PERSON>'s, sold in six-packs of 12-ounce cans and long-neck bottles, also will be rolled out statewide in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> O'Doul </PERSON>'s contains less than 0.5 percent alcohol by volume _ about the same amount found in soft drinks and fruit juices, the company said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it plans to spend at least $ 200 million to build a Spanish industrial plant to manufacture space-age fibers and other products. Construction at a site in <LOCATION> Asturias </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, is expected to begin in mid-1990 for a plant to make aramid fiber, which is used in aerospace and protective clothing, among other things. <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Archer </PERSON> said it was too early to say when the plant would open or how many people it would employ. The company may invest more money later to enable the plant to manufacture other fibers, polymer and chemical products, <PERSON> Archer </PERSON> said. `` The markets for the products will be the big determining factor'' in whether <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> expands the operation, he said. <LOCATION> Asturias </LOCATION>, located in northwest <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, has a good transportation network, a strong industrial base and a well-qualified labor force, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION>, which has had operations in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> since 1962, employs 20,000 people in 14 European countries.

<TEXT>
 In an effort to reduce costs, communications giant <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is offering special incentives to about 20,000 managers to retire by next Feb. 28, company officials announced Thursday. President <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> said he could n't predict how many managers might respond to the offer, but said about one-third of eligible employees have accepted at other companies offering similar programs. The program will enable 14,000 managers to qualify for pensions five years sooner than under previous guidelines and add five years of service for pension calculation purposes. Another 6,000 managers are eligible for immediate pensions without the service-added provision because they already are at least 45 years old and have 20 years of service. <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> said retiring managers may choose a lump sum payment in lieu of a service pension, and placement assistance and other incentives also are being provided.

 Striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> must restrict the size and location of some picket lines and are prohibited from confronting the carrier's working employees and customers, a judge ordered Thursday. A preliminary injunction issued by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> notes that violators of the order could be fined or jailed for contempt. The injunction covers <ORGANIZATION> Hartsfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and stems from hearings conducted by <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from March 22 to Oct. 4. `` We consider this a very significant order,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON>. `` It puts the strikers on notice that threatening behavior will not be tolerated and they will have to pay the price for their actions.'' <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said the two airports have been the sites of most problems between Eastern workers and Machinists since the strike began March 4. Eastern filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization five days later. On Sunday, seven strikers were arrested in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> after pickets pelted cars with rocks and injured one Eastern worker. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> on Wednesday ordered 13 Machinists to appear at a Dec. 12 hearing on possible civil contempt charges. The injunction prohibits the pickets from blocking entrances or harassing Eastern employees or passengers. They are also banned from trespassing on any Eastern property at the two airports and from making loud noises. In addition, strikers are blocked from vandalizing or defacing any property of Eastern or its customers, including placing stickers criticizing <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> is the parent of Miami-based Eastern. The strikers can have no more than two people conducting strike-related activities inside the terminals at the airports. At <ORGANIZATION> Hartsfield </ORGANIZATION>, the strikers are prohibited from mass demonstrations at some terminal exits and entrances. The strikers' tent city compound must be far enough from Eastern property so objects can not be thrown at buildings, according to the order At <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION>, the order limits the size of the picket line to 12 people at arrival and departure areas. Also, the lines must be at least 40 feet from the terminal entrance and 20 feet from the baggage claim exit area. `` We have n't done anything improper,'' said Machinist spokesman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> incident was prompted by someone who charged the picket line ... They are doing everything in their power to cripple the union and keep us from our First Amendment rights of free speech and assembly.'' <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> also ordered that a condensed version of the injunction be mailed to each of the more than 8,000 Machinists, which include aircraft mechanics, bag handlers and other ground workers. Contract talks are presently ongoing between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and its pilots and flight attendants unions, which decided to end their 8 -LCB- - month sympathy strikes last week

 Prices farmers got for raw products rose 1.4 percent in November over the month before, chiefly because of increased prices for strawberries, milk, eggs and celery, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The increases were partially offset by lower prices for hogs, grapefruit, apples and lemons, the department said. The prices were 2.1 percent higher than last year at this time. That increase came from higher prices for milk, hogs, cattle and eggs, partially offset by lower prices for soybeans, corn and broilers over the year, said the report. Feed grain prices, except oats, increased slightly from October. Wheat, rice and soybeans also showed small gains. Hog prices decreased from October, steers and heifers were up, but prices for cows and calves were down. Looking just at crops, the increase in November was .8 percent over the month before, but 5.1 percent below a year ago. Here's what happened: _ Potatoes averaged $ 6.14 per hundred pounds, up 84 cents from October _ Dry bean prices advanced $ 1.60 to $ 27.60 per hundred pounds _ Commercial vegetable prices were 1.4 percent higher due mainly to the near doubling of celery prices caused by a late harvest and celery shortage _ Onions, carrots and lettuce prices were lower than in October _ Oil bearing crop prices were 1.1 higher than in October, but 21 percent below a year ago Soybeans were $ 5.62 per bushel, up 7 cents from October. Peanuts declined 1.2 cents to 25.5 cents per pound. Cottonseed was at $ 111 a ton, an increase of $ 17 from October. Livestock and poultry was up .6 percent from October and 7.9 percent above November a year ago. `` Compared with October, higher prices for milk, eggs, cattle and turkeys more than offset lower prices for hogs, broilers and calves,'' said the report. Here are the details: _ Milk sold to plants and dealers averaged $ 15.20 per hundred pounds in November, up 50 cents from the month before and $ 1.88 from the year before _ <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> prices increased 2.4 cents per pound over October to 40.9 cents _ Broiler prices averaged 29.8 cents per pound down .8 cents from October _ Market egg prices averaged 72.8 cents per dozen for November, an increase of 8.6 cents from October _ Barrow and gilt prices decreased $ 2.30 per hundred pounds from October to $ 45 while sows decreased $ 3.60 per hundred pounds _ Beef cattle prices in November averaged $ 69.40 per hundred pounds up 70 cents from October, while calf prices decreased 80 cents to $ 87.30 per hundred pounds _ Calf prices decreased 80 cents to $ 87.30 per hundred pounds

 A jury found <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> guilty Thursday of dumping raw sewage into <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> waterways in the national rail passenger line's first such criminal trial. The state filed charges after <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> refused to stop dumping raw human wastes from moving trains onto the tracks and into the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Johns </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rice </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>. The six-member jury deliberated 1 -LCB- hours Thursday before returning a guilty verdict on four counts of commercial littering. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> contended federal law exempts it from state pollution control laws. The dumping practice, dating back more than a century, has also come under fire in several Western states. `` I'm surprised and disappointed in the verdict,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>'s attorney, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> `` I think it's unfair for the law to send mixed signals.'' <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> would appeal the decision `` just as quick as you're looking at daylight.'' <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> also faced one count of creating or allowing a nuisance to health, but <ORGANIZATION> 7th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> remanded it to <ORGANIZATION> Putnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, saying that prosecutors failed to prove anyone's health was endangered A trial on that count will be set later. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> has 20 days to file a motion for a new trial on the littering convictions. Sentencing was set for Jan. 19. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> could be prohibited from dumping and fined up to $ 5,000 on each count. The charges also carry a possible prison term of five years on each count, though no individual was named in the case. `` We are asking for injunction immediately -LRB- to stop <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> from dumping -RRB-,'' said State Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>. `` But it's obvious that the judge is not going to act until the sentencing date.'' The federally supported passenger railroad had threatened to suspend service to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, where it serves about 1 million passengers a year, if the state continued pressing its case. However, <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>, assistant general counsel for <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>, said following the verdict that no decision has been made to pull the rail service out of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> earlier had indicated if a guilty verdict were returned: `` I do n't think it will immediately affect rail service in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. I think in the long run it will ultimately lead to the end of the practice of dumping sewage in the waterways throughout the country.'' Many of <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>'s 600 passenger cars dispose of sewage either by dumping directly onto the tracks when toilets are flushed or by spraying the contents of 30-gallon holding tanks when the trains are traveling at least 35 miles per hour. In his closing argument, <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> admitted <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> had dumped human waste on bridges crossing waterways in <LOCATION> Putnam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, but said the practice was allowed under federal law. The company said in a federal court motion in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> that enforcement of the state law would impose undue burdens on <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>, but no hearings were held on the motion and <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> refused to delay trial pending a federal ruling. The defense called <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive officer, <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Claytor </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, as their only witness during the week-long trial. <PERSON> Claytor </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> recognized the dumping problem, but that the federally funded rail line could do little until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> appropriated more money for holding tanks or new cars. <PERSON> Claytor </PERSON> estimated it would take about $ 1 million to equip the current cars with the new system or $ 2 million to install it in new cars. The prosecution said <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> could not hide behind the law passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1976 and ignore environmental laws in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> needs to know the state of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> will not allow <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> _ the federal government _ to dump raw sewage in the waters of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> said. `` They -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- are trying to stretch the law to say something it does n't.''
