<TEXT>
 Attorneys said Friday they had reached a settlement of the wrongful death lawsuit filed against the widow of <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, who killed a <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> manager and himself after the 1987 stock market crash. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, financially wiped out by `` Black Monday,'' walked into the <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Oct. 26, 1987, one week after the crash, killing office manager <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Argilagos </PERSON> and paralyzing his broker, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolokoff </PERSON>. Attorneys R.W. `` Buddy'' <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Areces </PERSON>, representing <PERSON> Argilagos </PERSON>, announced the case was settled, but that <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenbaum </PERSON> ordered that the amount of damages not be disclosed. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, 53, was actually <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, a disbarred lawyer and federally protected witness relocated to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. His testimony in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> helped convict mob figures in a 1977 stock fraud case, which drew death threats from organized crime figures. In testimony Thursday, <PERSON> Kolokoff </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>'s depression grew steadily worse. `` After the crash, he was really depressed _ in a state of shock,'' <PERSON> Kolokoff </PERSON> said. `` As the week wore on, he talked about wanting to kill himself.'' <PERSON> Kolokoff </PERSON>, his wife <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Argilagos </PERSON>' survivors filed the civil suit against <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Judith </PERSON>. The settlement Friday resolved a lawsuit by <PERSON> Kolokoff </PERSON>, one by the family of <PERSON> Argilagos </PERSON>, and on Thursday that he had listened to <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>'s increasingly desperate talk about overdosing on drugs or carbon monoxide and tried to convince him he could bounce back `` It was money; it was n't his life,'' <PERSON> Kolokoff </PERSON> recalled telling him. `` He just would n't listen to anything.'' The day before the shooting, a week after the market crash, <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> called <PERSON> Kolokoff </PERSON> at home, the broker said. <PERSON> Kolokoff </PERSON> assured him that he was a valuable customer and that <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> would work with him. However, when <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> came in Monday planning to pay $ 60,000 to $ 70,000 to keep his account open, he was told he needed $ 130,000. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> said he would return with the money. He came back later, went into <PERSON> Argilagos </PERSON>' office with <PERSON> Kolokoff </PERSON>, and pulled his gun. `` Mr. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> took out the gun and said: ` Take this, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON>,' and fired one shot,'' <PERSON> Kolokoff </PERSON> said. `` And that's the last thing I remember.'' Now a paraplegic, <PERSON> Kolokoff </PERSON> said his life is dominated by pain. His income has dropped to $ 45,000, compared to 1987 when he was on track to earn $ 295,000, he said, and his medical bills exceeded $ 324,000. <PERSON> Kolokoff </PERSON> said he overcame early depression with determination to live. `` I want to live,'' he said. `` I have a really good family. I ca n't even think about losing them.''

<HEAD>Coupon Redemption Fraud Couple Get Stiff Sentences</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A couple who were the only two of 62 defendants who went to trial in a $ 12 million coupon-redemption fraud have received stiff prison sentences. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Winokur </PERSON> refused to plead guilty for his part in the scheme but was sentenced Thursday to 17 years. His wife, <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, who turned down the state's offer of five years' probation, was sentenced to seven years. <ORGANIZATION> Broward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Moe </PERSON> gave <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Winokur </PERSON> the maximum sentence under the state's guidelines. That was more than triple the time the coupon fraud mastermind, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Krasnick </PERSON>, received after admitting his guilt in a plea deal. <PERSON> Florence </PERSON> <PERSON> Winokur </PERSON> faced a maximum penalty of nine years. Besides serving prison time, <PERSON> Moe </PERSON> ordered the Winokurs to pay $ 230,000 in restitution and each serve 10 years' probation. The state offered <PERSON> Winokur </PERSON> a 2 -LCB- - year sentence when he was arrested more than a year ago `` I would have loved to give him 2 -LCB- years,'' <PERSON> Moe </PERSON> said before he sentenced the Winokurs. `` All he had to do was say he did it. And he'd probably be walking the streets now'' because prison overcrowding means that most inmates serve only about a third of their sentences. `` I do n't think there was n't a person associated with the case that did n't urge them to take a deal,'' <PERSON> Moe </PERSON> said. `` I'm not responsible for their choices.'' The Winokurs were convicted three weeks ago on charges of racketeering, grand theft and conspiracy. They operated stores in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> counties in 1986-88 solely to illegally redeem coupons. The stores had products on their shelves but the Winokurs seldom made a sale, according to prosecutors. The shops were set up as facades to redeem $ 200,000 worth of coupons for products never sold. The enterprise, which involved 81 stores, bought coupons in bulk from charitable organizations and had other people clip, sort and crumple coupons to make them look handled by consumers.

 A police officer got his nose out of joint and arrested a budding professional clown for wearing a plastic nose and failing to get out of her car during a recent drug crackdown. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cherrington </PERSON>, a 47-year-old mother of two, spent 5 -LCB- hours in jail and faces up to 18 months behind bars and $ 1,500 in fines. But that wo n't stop her from wearing a plastic nose when she appears in court. She was arrested Aug. 4 when she and her 20-year-old son visited a friend. Deputies investigating for drugs had set up a roadblock and were stopping all cars entering an apartment complex. She had popped on one of her favorite dime store noses with bright yellow glasses attached. But the fake nose failed to tickle Deputy <PERSON> Jimmie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who ordered her to take it off and get out of the car. When she refused, she was arrested and charged with wearing a mask in public and resisting arrest without violence. The nose was confiscated as evidence. `` She was being a real smart aleck,'' the officer said. `` It was n't a situation to make jokes in.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Cherrington </PERSON> said Thursday that the time spent in the Orange County Jail taught her a lesson. `` You get a headache laying your head on those hard wood seats that everyone uses as a bed,'' she said. `` Now maybe if a police officer says get out of the car I wo n't take so long.'' Still, she plans to be herself when she appears in court. `` I'll definitely pop my nose on for the judge,'' she said

 Threats by protesters failed to keep truckers away from <ORGANIZATION> Debbie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Duz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Donuts </ORGANIZATION>, which has topless waitresses, adult videos, doughnuts and coffee. As a dozen protesters stood across the street carrying signs with slogans such as, `` Welcome to the Pit of Iniquity,'' a thin but steady stream of customers ventured inside Friday to pay $ 2 for a doughnut and cup of coffee served by one of six waitresses wearing only shorts and shoes. Shop owner <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortese </PERSON> hustled around the store coordinating waitresses and workers. He opened for a sneak preview about three weeks ago, but many truckers stayed away, waiting for the publicity to die down, <PERSON> Cortese </PERSON> said. On Friday, the first trucker pulled into the parking lot off Interstate 25 a half-hour after the shop opened about noon. Two others arrived a few minutes later. `` I just kind of wondered what was going on,'' said <PERSON> Jeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, driving an 18-wheel truck for a <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> company. `` I dropped some lambs off, I had to make a phone call and I thought I'd have a doughnut and a cup of coffee.'' The trucker said he was n't concerned about the protesters who were filming customers. Opponents have promised to notify trucking companies of their drivers' whereabouts. `` They wo n't care,'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. `` They'll get a kick out of it.'' Patrons chatted with English topless model <PERSON> Debby </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Trent </PERSON>, hired by <PERSON> Cortese </PERSON> for the shop's opening, or spent $ 5 for a photograph with her. <PERSON> Debby </PERSON> <PERSON> Duz </PERSON> <PERSON> Donuts </PERSON> also has an adult entertainment room with magazines, videos and posters. Opponents have gathered 7,000 signatures on a petition against the shop. `` Our ultimate goal is to shut <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Duz </PERSON> Donuts down,'' said <PERSON> Cheri </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>. She complained that county commissioners, `` because they fear a lawsuit from Cortese, ca n't make a law to get him out of the state.'' `` To get him out of the state, we have to go through the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said. Protests would continue, she promised. A few supporters of the doughnut shop plan to picket, too. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Curley </PERSON> of <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said he will carry signs because `` I do n't like a small vocal minority telling us what shops can open.''

 Two women hijacked a helicopter at gunpoint Friday, snatched two inmates from a prison yard and fled the region in a waiting van, but all four were captured after a shootout in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, authorities said. `` We can confirm they were taken into custody, all four of them,'' said <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON> <PERSON> Novak </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>. The wild shootout in <LOCATION> Holdrege </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, involved a gunfire-punctuated pursuit of a rented van through a residential neighborhood, said a witness to the final showdown. `` They crossed a median and hit a tree,'' the witness, a woman who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` We could definitely see they had guns and were shooting. The police tried to arrest them by swerving in front of the truck but they ran up into a yard.'' The nine-minute chase began when a <LOCATION> Holdrege </LOCATION> police officer spotted the yellow van at 6:18 p.m. and the pursuit wound through town until it ended at 6:27 p.m., said <LOCATION> Phelps </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. The shooting started after the van struck a police car head-on, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. `` After the first encounter they went down the street shooting houses and at people,'' he said. About eight officers were involved in the chase and about five were shot at, he said. At least eight shots penetrated the car's windshield, police said The van stopped and the four were arrested without further resistance after one of the men was shot, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. `` One of them was hit and was bleeding pretty bad,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. `` He's fine. He just got hit in the hand.'' <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was at <ORGANIZATION> Good </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Samaritan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kearney </LOCATION> with a shotgun pellet possibly lodged in a finger on his right hand, said <LOCATION> Phelps </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Dwayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Holdrege </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said there were no other injuries, despite indiscriminate shooting by the suspects as police converged on them in this farming town of about 5,600 people in south-central <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, about 40 miles north of the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> line. Deputy County <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said police confiscated a 9mm automatic and a .22 - caliber <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said the other man and woman were being held at the <LOCATION> Phelps </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>, the other woman was being held at <LOCATION> Holdrege </LOCATION> police headquarters. The prosecutor said he expected the four would be in court Monday. None of the four was formally charged, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. `` We've got plenty to hold them on,'' he added. Another witness, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON>, said he and his neighbor <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brenn </PERSON> ducked ducked behind <PERSON> Brenn </PERSON>'s pickup truck when the shooting began about two houses away. `` I saw the gun come out of the passenger side of the van and then they never stopped shooting,'' <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON> said. `` It was just like on TV. These were big guns, not little ones.'' Mayor <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said the town was quiet again at about 9 p.m. `` There's probably some pretty excited people,'' she said. `` We're not accustomed to this.'' In the brazen, daylight prison break, frustrated guards held their fire because they could not get a clear shot at the helicopter and feared that the pilot was being held hostage, said <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonough </PERSON>, a corrections spokewoman. Nevertheless, authorities ordered an investigation to determine why a guard refused three orders from prison superintendent <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> to open fire on the helicopter. `` From the time the helicopter came into view, from the point of touchdown to takeoff, was 10 to 15 seconds,'' <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said. `` My recollection was that as the inmates were diving headfirst into the helicopter, it was lifting off.'' The pilot was found bound and gagged about 35 miles north of the medium-security state prison and the helicopter was found nearby after authorities received an anonymous telephone call. Authorities said the women were believed to be wives of the escaped inmates, even though one of the women gave the name of a former deputy sheriff who had been fired for fraternizing with inmates. The two escaped inmates were cellmates. The women and the escapees apparently transferred to a rented van and eluded police. Authorities set up roadblocks on highways leading from the prison and the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> provided helicopters for the search. The inmates were identified as <PERSON> Freddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON>, 21, who was serving a four-year sentence for robbery, and <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 21, who was sentenced for sexual assault, theft and criminal impersonation in a bad check charge. <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> would have been eligible for parole in September 1991, while <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s parole eligibility date was October 1996. One of the woman who rented the helicopter identified herself as <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Arapahoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> deputy fired for fraternization, but from descriptions given by the pilot, authorities now believe the hijacking was carried out by <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, wives of the two inmates. The women apparently had planned to hijack a helicopter earlier in the week, but their plans had to be delayed for several days due to bad weather, <PERSON> McDonough </PERSON> said. The women rented the helicopter from <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, saying they wanted to take some photos of real estate near the prison, said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kautzky </PERSON>, director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Once near the prison, one woman pulled a gun and ordered the pilot to land, <PERSON> Kautzky </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> Correctional Facility in <LOCATION> Crowley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> is about 50 miles east of <LOCATION> Pueblo </LOCATION>, on the plains of southeastern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. After the escape, the helicopter flew north and the pilot was forced to land near a farmhouse and the rental truck. The pilot, <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Graves </PERSON>, was taken to the farmhouse where he was bound and gagged. Graves later was taken to the <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Hugo </LOCATION> for security, authorities said. He was being interviewed by police. The incident was the latest in a rash of helicopter prison escapes and attempts. In April, a helicopter crashed after its tail rotor snagged on a fence at the federal <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The pilot and the prisoner survived. In July 1988, a woman hijacked a helicopter and forced the pilot to land in the prison yard at the Penitentiary of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>. Three convicts escped but later were captured. In November 1986, an inmate escaped from the minimum-security federal prison in <LOCATION> Pleasanton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. He later hijacked a helicopter and returned to the prison to free a woman inmate who worked with him in the prison business office. They were captured 10 days later while buying wedding rings.

<TEXT>
 They're nuts about white squirrels in <LOCATION> Marionville </LOCATION>. Just ask the folks at the White Squirrel Furniture Store, the White Squirrel Car Wash or the White Squirrel Hollow Bed & amp; Breakfast. And watch where you're driving: A 21-year-old city ordinance imposes a $ 500 fine for deliberately injuring or killing one of the rare albino squirrels. Motorists must yield right of way to them. No one has ever been arrested for violating the law, but that does n't mean it's taken lightly. `` If I catch somebody killing a white squirrel, I will issue a citation,'' said Police Chief <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Merritt </PERSON>, who wears a squirrel-emblazoned shoulder patch on his uniform. `` It's no joke.'' Some people even go so far as to trap the albinos' gray cousins and banish them from the small southwest Missouri town to give the white squirrels first crack at the nuts. <LOCATION> Marionville </LOCATION>, home to 2,000 people and nearly half that many white squirrels, has a billboard welcoming visitors to the `` Home of the White Squirrel.'' Only one other community in the nation _ <LOCATION> Olney </LOCATION><LOCATION> , </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> _ is known to have a sizable concentration of the snow-white squirrels, but <LOCATION> Marionville </LOCATION>'s colony is much larger, says <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Smart </PERSON>, a local authority and booster of the animal. `` We've blown <PERSON> Olney </PERSON> off the map,'' he boasts. <PERSON> Olney </PERSON> has a measly few dozen squirrels, he figures. Wildlife experts say finding any albino animal colony the size of <LOCATION> Marionville </LOCATION>'s is rare. `` Normally you see an albino show up occasionally in a population such as squirrels or birds or deer, but entire populations are not something you come across all that frequently,'' said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurzejeski </PERSON>, a state wildlife research biologist. Signs of <LOCATION> Marionville </LOCATION>'s affection for the white squirrel, which mates and otherwise interacts normally with its gray cousin, are everywhere. The <ORGANIZATION> Lions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> sells white squirrel T-shirts and pins to raise money to buy redwood boxes that are placed in trees as homes for the squirrels. More than 500 dens have been put up, and volunteers have planted hundreds of nut trees. `` We've had orders for T-shirts from <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>,'' says Smart, a Lions member. `` <LOCATION> Marionville </LOCATION> is a small town, but people who grew up here and moved away still remember their roots and want to help the white squirrel.'' White squirrels first appeared in <LOCATION> Marionville </LOCATION> around 1860, Smart says. According to local legend, a couple of the critters escaped from a traveling circus and began multiplying, or were the product of a weird experiment by a local scientist. Smart became fascinated by white squirrels when one showed up on the deck of his home about 12 years ago. He set out to increase the population by trapping the more numerous gray squirrels in the woods around his home and releasing them several miles away to provide more room for the whites. `` We trapped 110 gray squirrels in a year and a half,'' he said. `` It was just amazing what the whites did then.'' Smart estimates that about three dozen albino squirrels live in 30 den boxes and in trees on his heavily wooded property. `` I have one picture at home with 17 white squirrels in it,'' he said. Retirees <PERSON> Johnie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> spend hours on their back porch watching the white squirrels munch corn and walnuts placed at their feeders. The couple had no white squirrels until Smart transplanted some there a few years ago. `` They'll play just like a little kitten,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. `` There will be five or six in the yard looking for something to eat and I'll say, ` Do n't leave, <PERSON> Johnie </PERSON>'s bringing you something.' I swear they can understand me.'' <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON>, who runs the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squirrel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hollow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Breakfast with her husband, <PERSON> Clint </PERSON>, says people come for miles to see the animals. `` A lot of people do n't really believe we have white squirrels because they stop at noon and do n't see them,'' she said. `` The best time to see them is 6:30 or 7 in the morning and around 7, 7:30 at night when they're feeding. They do n't like the heat and I think the light hurts their pink eyes.'' Smart used to hunt gray squirrels -LRB- `` Young squirrel, fried, with biscuits and gravy _ you ca n't beat it'' -RRB-, but not anymore. `` The squirrels are a hobby, a challenge for me now,'' he says. `` I guess I'm paying back for all the hunting I used to do.''

 The seventh tropical depression of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane season formed Friday off the African coast, forecasters reported. At 10:30 p.m. EDT, the depression's poorly defined center was near latitude 17.6 degrees north and longitude 28.5 west, about 200 miles west of the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Sal </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>. The depression, moving west-northwest at about 18 mph, is expected to slow during the weekend and turn toward the northwest, the center reported. Maximum sustained winds were estimated at 35 mph.

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is negotiating with its counterparts in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to establish a park spanning the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION>, according to Saturday editions of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Post. Park officials will visit Siberian areas across the strait from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> next month and return with Soviet officials who will inspect Alaskan sites, the newspaper said. The service already administers the <ORGANIZATION> Bering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preserve </ORGANIZATION>, a 2.7-million acre wild area just north of <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION>. There is no comparable preserve on the Soviet side. Such a park could make it easier for scientists to conduct research on both sides of the border and make it easier for wildlife biologists to track migratory species like walrus moving between the two countries. In the last Ice Age, the strait was dry, which permitted people and animals to move between <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The newspaper said the park project, still embryonic, is known around the headquarters of the park service as `` glasnost and the glaciers.''

 The president of the nation's largest pharmacy chain pleaded innocent Friday to charges of bribing an <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmacy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> member and of possession of criminal tools. <ORGANIZATION> Rite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grass </PERSON>, 35, entered the plea in <ORGANIZATION> Cuyahoga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pleas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> before Judge <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Villanueva </PERSON>. Grass is free on $ 100,000 bond. He declined to comment on the case after the hearing. His <LOCATION> Shiremanstown </LOCATION>, Pa.-based company later released a three-page statement saying the indictment against Grass and the company is `` bizarre.'' `` They -LRB- Grass and Rite Aid -RRB- have indicated that the charge of bribery is a vicious attempt to blemish the corporation and its president and have called the charge absurd,'' the release said. The indictment alleged that Grass and the company used an aircraft as the criminal tool last March and April. Grass was arrested April 27 at a hotel near <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> Hopkins International Airport. Prosecutors said the arrest came after the alleged bribe was videotaped. On June 14, a grand jury handed up a secret indictment accusing Grass of offering a $ 33,000 bribe to <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilczynski </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmacy </ORGANIZATION>, in exchange for his stepping down from the board. Prosecutors have said the company and Grass wanted to get control of the board and fire its executive director, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wickham </PERSON>. Rite Aid said <PERSON> Wickham </PERSON> had been harassing the company in enforcing pharmacy regulations. The indictment was unsealed Aug. 1. Both charges are felonies. The bribery charge carries a maximum prison term of 10 years and a $ 5,000 fine. Possession of criminal tools is punishable by a maximum five years in prison and $ 2,500 fine. Rite Aid has said a $ 33,249 corporate check Grass gave <PERSON> Wilczynski </PERSON> was a legal buyout of <PERSON> Wilczynski </PERSON>'s consulting contract with <ORGANIZATION> Lane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> that Rite Aid acquired April 10.

<HEAD>Rudeness the Issue in Recall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKLAND, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two officials facing a recall election today said the town was wasting money on petty politics, but their opponents said rudeness by officials was a bona fide issue. `` For one thing I think it's ridiculous because we're both up for election in six months,'' said <PERSON> Selectman </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Gagnon </PERSON>, who estimated the special election's cost at $ 10,000. Today, just more than a year after this town's citizens adopted a bylaw allowing for recall elections, voters face the question of whether the current five-member board has been ill-mannered and unresponsive. The election features five candidates, including the two incumbents, running for two seats. `` What it comes down to is there's been a small group of people in the town hall who have been trying to operate the place like it's their private club,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, who helped lead the recall campaign that's pushing three alternative candidates <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said the selectmen betrayed the public in a variety of ways, including at one point locking townspeople out of the town hall during a meeting and snickering at people with whom they disagreed. `` There's just been abusive treatment. Laughing at people, making comments. It's happened to me and it's happened to other people,'' said <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, who lost a seat on the board in March by a narrow margin. Selectman <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Noonan </PERSON>, who like <PERSON> Gagnon </PERSON> could be forced from her post, disagreed. `` I ca n't remember any incident where any member on the board was rude to people,'' she said. `` We listen to all the issues that come before us. We certainly would n't degrade a person if we did n't agree with an issue.'' Residents in this town of 15,500 people south of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> say the bickering began in April when the board opted against renewing the contract of Police Chief <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who has since been demoted. The selectmen's decision was broadcast live on local cable television and many people were bewildered because during the chief's tenure crime had subsided. `` There was no debate, no discussion. And then when it was asked why they were n't renewing his contract they refused to give a reason,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. Within days, 600 citizens had gathered to discuss the turn of events, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. Within months, more than 1,800 signatures had been placed on a recall petition.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s opposition to the Communist government once brought him a year in prison. Now, the general who put him behind bars appears poised to appoint him prime minister. The tall, taciturn 62-year-old Solidarity journalist is the least publicly known of the three candidates the labor movement offered to communist President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>. But his links to Solidarity date to the August 1980 strikes that created the union. And his activism goes back to the days after World War II, when the Communists began consolidating power. Now, he is ready to accept <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s expected offer to be the first non-Communist head of an East bloc government, a circumstance wrought by Solidarity's burgeoning political power. `` There have been several historical moments that show Poles can strive for new solutions and unusual ones, really innovative ones, and that we can get somewhere,'' he said Friday after meeting with <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>. `` My hope is that such a moment is now arriving pyschologically _ that people will feel there is such a situation.'' A close adviser to Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> edits the movement's weekly newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> Tygodnik </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarnosc </ORGANIZATION>. He also is closely linked to the Roman Catholic church, and in 1957 helped found the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligentsia </ORGANIZATION>, an influential forum that served as a bulwark for <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> opposition to Communist ideology. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> was a key negotiator during the pivotal talks earlier this year that resulted in the legalization of Solidarity and opposition participation in elections. The talks were initiated by authorities unable to control <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s sinking economy and disgruntled populace. He led the negotiating team that focuses on trade union freedoms, participated in political discussions and fought for press freedoms in a nation where the government controls all publications. Trained as a lawyer, he submitted the court application for restoration of Solidarity's legal status provided for in the accords reached with authorities. When the petition was granted on April 17, he stood on the courthouse steps grinning broadly, arms raised and a bouquet of red tulips in one hand. `` Today for me means the restoration of justice,'' he said then. Recalling that he had been on hand when the union was first legalized in 1980 _ it was outlawed 16 months later _ he added: `` I hope I will not have to come here a third time.'' On other days, though, he appears dour and even cold. Some express concern that his Catholic faith and legal training have made him overly deliberative and unable to react quickly. A widower who lost his young wife to cancer and still wears his wedding ring, <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> raised three sons alone in a small apartment on <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s main commercial street. Born on April 18, 1927, in the small central <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> city of Plock, <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> was raised in a family of intellectuals. By 21, he had been dismissed from his Academic Editing House job for keeping close ties to the church during the early years of Communist <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. He began to work with <ORGANIZATION> PAX </ORGANIZATION>, an organization set up by the government to dilute church-based opposition. But by 1955 he was so at odds with the mix of politics and religion that he was suspended. In 1958, he founded the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> monthly magazine Wiez, or Link, which he edited until 1981, when he began <ORGANIZATION> Tygodnik </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarnosc </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> magazine reflected, and to a degree preceded, the modernization of Catholicism put forth by the second <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. He became aligned with ZNAK, a group supporting regeneration of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> based on Catholic values. Officially condoned under the protection of the church, <ORGANIZATION> ZNAK </ORGANIZATION> had a Sejm delegation and <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> became a parliament deputy in 1961. By 1970, <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s agitation for democratization of public life and social justice had run afoul of official tolerance and he was not allowed another term. As the opposition began organizing in the mid-1970s, especially after worker riots in 1976, <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in search of support and aid. Mention of free trade unions in a West German newspaper interview resulted in withdrawal of his passport for four years. <PERSON> Wiez </PERSON> became a more radical forum, publishing articles by <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON> and other strong opposition voices. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> initiated a letter by more than 60 intellectuals urging authorities to find a peaceful solutions to the strikes that erupted on the Baltic coast in August 1980 and led to Solidarity's founding On Aug. 22, he arrived at the strikebound Lenin shipyard in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> and after a nightlong talk with <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> became the head of a group of experts to help the workers organize the union and negotiate with government officials. With the martial-law crackdown announced by <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> on Dec. 13, 1981, <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> was jailed. He was released on Dec. 23, 1982, and resumed as a union adviser. After historically democratic elections were scheduled in June, he did not run for office, preferring to edit the union's new legal and independent weekly.

 <PERSON> Ralf </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> made it easily, strolling to freedom in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, but escape from communist <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Joerg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Birgitt </PERSON> was a desperate crawl through fields and mosquito-infested woods. `` We had no food or water, and sometimes we had no more strength,'' <PERSON> Joerg </PERSON>, 27, said Friday after he and his wife arrived in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, still tired and sunburned from the three-day ordeal. Thousands of East Germans are flocking to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to escape the strict East German regime. Many go through liberal <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, which is clearing the barbed wire from its border with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. About 100,000 East Germans are expected to reach <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> this year, by escape or with permission. One of the places they are taken first is the overflowing camp in this city an hour's drove northeast of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Birgitt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joerg </PERSON>'s 22-year-old wife, displayed cuts on her forearm and said, `` I got these climbing over the barbed wire'' in a stretch of the Hungarian border that had not been cleared. Like most of the others, <PERSON> Joerg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Birgitt </PERSON> fled because of the East German government's resistance to the political and economic reforms now spreading through the Soviet bloc with the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s blessing East Germans have difficulty getting permission to travel to the West, but need no special permission to visit communist <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, so it became an escape route when barricaded frontier was opened earlier this year. More than 1,500 are believed to have used it successfully. The young couple and other refugees interviewed at <LOCATION> Giessen </LOCATION> asked that their surnames be withheld to avoid trouble for relatives at home. `` We tried it a first time last week, but Hungarian border guards caught us,'' <PERSON> Joerg </PERSON> said. `` They were nice. They just asked us to promise never to do it again.'' On the second try, a farmer with whom they hitched a ride dropped them about six miles from the frontier on Aug. 13. <PERSON> Joerg </PERSON> said they did n't know where border controls were weakest, so they crawled through scorching cornfields, brush and woods searching for the right time and place. `` We knew some border fences had been removed, but we did n't know where,'' he said. `` There are a lot of escapees who get help and have access to information.'' He and <PERSON> Birgitt </PERSON> hid in a cornfield the first night and in woods the second, <PERSON> Joerg </PERSON> said. `` We lay low during daylight, carefully observing everything,'' he said. `` Then, at night, we would go inch by inch, very carefully, to make sure we were n't noticed. There were millions of mosquitoes, it was really hot and we had nothing to drink.'' Birgitt remembered the exhaustion and fear of being separated. `` Sometimes we lost each other and could only find one another by calling out,'' she said. `` There were times when I thought I just could n't go on.'' They climbed the fence Tuesday near <LOCATION> Deutschkreutz </LOCATION>, about 90 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, and had a welcome drink from a brook. West German authorities arranged passage to <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, then to the <LOCATION> Giessen </LOCATION> camp, where they will be fed and housed until they can start a new life. Because up to 500 East Germans arrive at <LOCATION> Giessen </LOCATION> on a single day, the government announced Friday it was opening another camp. East Germans were lined up Friday outside the stucco camp buildings at <LOCATION> Giessen </LOCATION>, waiting to fill out documents or for lunch in the cafeteria. Others leaned through windows of their temporary lodgings to talk with fellow refugees. Those who find lodgings with relatives usually leave <LOCATION> Giessen </LOCATION> in three or four days, but others remain a week or more. Many recent escapees are young people who left jobs to go West, like <PERSON> Ralf </PERSON>, a 20-year-old electrician, and his friend, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, an auto mechanic, who is 21. <PERSON> Ralf </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, said they just walked across the border into <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. `` It took about three hours,'' he said. `` We had planned the whole thing. Everything went according to our plans.'' <PERSON> Jeannette </PERSON>, a 22-year-old from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, said it took her 13 hours to reach <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> through woods, brush and thorny bushes, and she brought wire-cutters to snip through the fence. She said she said she found at least 25 other East Germans in an Austrian border village. All those interviewed said they fled <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> because they were fed up with conditions there. `` There is no freedom to protest, no freedom of the press, no freedom of opinion, and things are not going to change anytime soon,'' <PERSON> Joerg </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Government Announces New Generic Drug Steps</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Government health officials hope that more inspectors, tougher laws and other regulatory changes will assure the public that the scandal-tainted generic drug industry sells safe products. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and its parent agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, announced a broad plan of attack Friday aimed at serving notice to pharmaceutical manufacturers _ and consumers _ that corrupt and fraudulent practices must stop. `` I stand ready to work cooperatively with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to meet the legislative and budgetary requirements that are pivotal to assuring full confidence in the generic drugs program,'' <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said in a written statement. The plan comes in the wake of months of revelations of gratuities paid by companies to federal regulators and of false information provided to the government by applicants for new drugs. There have been no indications of unsafe generic drugs reaching the market. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> announced they will increase federal oversight of drug manufacturers and their products and revamp procedures used to review drug applications. Two sources, speaking on condition they not be identified, said the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> would spend $ 18 million to hire additional inspectors. Agency spokesman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Nesbit </PERSON> said the final figure had not been determined. But he said an undetermined number of new employees would be hired for field work such as inspections of manufacturing plants, and to check applications submitted to <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> by developers of new drugs. To pay for the additional work, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Young </PERSON> proposed fees that would be levied on companies applying for permission to market new generic drugs. There currently are no application fees. The government has the power to ban the sales of drugs that it learns were approved after companies provided fraudulent information to regulators. Sources said the proposed legislation would give the government authority to remove a drug from the market if investigators prove other types of fraud, such as gratuities to regulators for checking one company's application before another's, in the approval process. Companies wishing to obtain federal approval to sell a new drug test it and submit the results to the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>, which checks the records of the work. Producers must satisfy the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> that their product functions equivalently to the drug they are mimicking. The government also said it would create an ombudsman within <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> to hear complaints from the pharmaceutical industry, consumers and agency whistle blowers. The division within <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> that currently oversees generic drugs would be raised a notch in the agency's structure, giving it more clout And <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said drug review procedures would be `` reorganized and strengthened.'' On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said it had started collecting thousands of samples of the 30 most commonly used generic drugs so it could conduct safety tests on them. The $ 5 billion generic drug industry is ferociously competitive, as dozens of mostly small and mid-size companies vie to market copies of brandname drugs after patents expire. The first such generic drug to hit the market generally gets and keeps the lion's share of sales The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has been under pressure from <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, principally from Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., whose <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> investigations subcommittee has conducted its own probe of the problems Staff investigators have shared information with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's Office in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, which has obtained guilty pleas from three <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> officials, two drug companies and three drug company executives. This spring, <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> began investigating 11 companies for possible violations of federal safety and production regulations.

<HEAD>Former Top Pierce Aide Refuses to Comply with Congressional Subpoena</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The man former Housing Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> once called his `` right hand'' is refusing to cooperate with congressional investigators, citing his right against self-incrimination in snubbing a subcommittee's subpoena that he testify. <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s one-time executive assistant, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee Friday that he was asserting his Fifth Amendment rights because the conduct of panel members convinced him he would not receive a fair hearing. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said attacks last month by several panel members after he failed to appear as scheduled `` made it clear that the subcommittee members have prejudged me and have no intention of affording me a fair and evenhanded hearing.'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Banoun </PERSON>, lashed out at subcommittee Chairman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, other panel members and its staff, saying in a separate letter that all had made knowingly inaccurate statements about <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> during televised hearings, which <PERSON> Banoun </PERSON> called a `` charade.'' Attempts to reach <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., and subcommittee staffers were unsuccessful There was no answer at the subcommittee office when the <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Banoun </PERSON> letters were obtained late Friday. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>' home office in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said the Democratic congressman was on vacation and unavailable for comment. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> was <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s top aide for several years and after leaving the agency invested in several projects that received lucrative subsidies from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. His successor as <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s executive assistant, <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, appeared before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in May but refused to answer questions, also asserting her Fifth Amendment rights. The subcommittee, in recess until after Labor Day, has been investigating influence-peddling, mismanagement and fraud at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Testimony and other evidence indicates that former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials and prominent Republicans received special treatment from the agency that helped them reap millions of dollars in government financing and subsidies. The hearings and other sources of information also have shown that <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s internal controls were so poor that millions of dollars can not be accounted for and that the total of Reagan-era fraud might surpass $ 2 billion. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a senior vice president at <PERSON> Paine </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON>, had been scheduled to appear before the subcommittee July 28 but asked for a continuance because <PERSON> Banoun </PERSON> had to undergo emergency surgery three days before. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> refused to grant a continuance and ordered <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> to appear without counsel or with another attorney. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> refused, but <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> nonetheless called him to the witness table at the hearing, then launched into a lengthy attack on him when he failed to appear. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> had `` joined a lucrative fraternity of former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> employees'' that had `` cashed in so spectacularly on moderate rehabilitation programs.'' Other panel members joined in criticizing <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, and the committee later issued subpoenas requiring <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> to produce myriad records of his HUD-related dealings by Friday. <PERSON> Banoun </PERSON>, in the letter to <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, said the chairman and the subcommittee members and staffers had ignored <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s right to counsel and instead grandstanded for the television audience. `` You went through the charade of calling Mr. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> to the witness table in front of live television cameras knowing all along that he had courteously informed you that he would not appear,'' <PERSON> Banoun </PERSON> said in the letter. `` The conduct of certain members of the subcommittee and of its staff in dealing with Mr. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> ... have made it abundantly clear that they have adversely prejudged Mr. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and have no intention other than to publicly vilify him in order to achieve their own personal motivation,'' the letter said. `` This fact is further buttressed by the vindictive subpoenas issued to Mr. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Banoun </PERSON> said the subpoenas included demands for numerous documents the subcommittee has access to and a demand that he appear before the panel Sept. 27 _ an appearance that would be a month later than <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> sought when he asked for the continuance. `` This raises a question as to the urgency which prompted the denial of his initial request for a short continuance,'' <PERSON> Banoun </PERSON>'s letter said

 <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bachman </PERSON> was cool, calm and unflappable during the 36 minutes that fate teamed him with a veteran pilot trying to land a damaged DC-10 at the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, airport last month. But the 27-year-old air traffic controller who had completed his training just three months earlier broke into tears after <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 232 touched down, cartwheeled and burst into flames. Of the 296 people aboard the jetliner en route from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, 111 were killed. That 185 survived is widely credited to the performance of pilot <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bachman </PERSON> and rescue-response efforts on the ground. Listening Friday to a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> tape of his radio interchanges with <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bachman </PERSON> recalled his thoughts at the time as alternating between pessimism and optimism. `` Right after it happened, I had to turn away, because I did n't think anybody would come away from it,'' <PERSON> Bachman </PERSON> said `` And then I went downstairs and cried.'' While he had heard reports of some survivors, <PERSON> Bachman </PERSON> said it was n't until five hours after the crash _ and after he had left work _ that he learned watching the news on television that more than half those aboard had survived. `` You just try to wonder what you could have done differently,'' <PERSON> Bachman </PERSON> said. `` The first couple of days afterward, I did n't sleep at all.'' Later, he concluded he would not have done anything differently. Neither, apparently, would any of his bosses. `` There was not a controller there that was not doing his job,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> air traffic manager at <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` There's no sign that anyone failed to do their job. While an investigation into the crash is continuing and officials have yet to pinpoint its cause, <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> was so satisfied with <PERSON> Bachman </PERSON>'s role that he presented him with a medal Friday for outstanding job performance. It was 3:23 p.m. CDT on July 19 when air traffic controllers in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> notified <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> that a stricken jetliner 40 miles away was headed for the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> airport. Three minutes later, <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bachman </PERSON> were having their first conversation. `` OK, so you know we have almost no control ability, very little elevator and almost no aileron,'' <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bachman </PERSON>. `` We are controlling the turns by power. ... We can only turn right, but we ca n't turn left.'' Ten minutes later, the pilot, with a gasp in his voice, tells <PERSON> Bachman </PERSON>: `` I have serious doubts about making the airport. Have you got some place near there that we might be able to ditch? Unless we get control of this airplane, we're going to put it down, wherever it happens to be.'' While <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials on the ground scrambled to pinpoint possible highways where the jetliner could land, <PERSON> Bachman </PERSON> several times directed <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> to change his course to keep away from populated areas. `` Widen out just slightly to your left ... to take you away from the city,'' <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> is told just eight minutes before the crash. `` Whatever you do, keep us away from the city,'' the pilot radios back. Three minutes later, <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> asks for possible alternatives to the airport. `` We're going to have to put it down on something solid, if we can.'' At 3:57 p.m., <PERSON> Bachman </PERSON> says, `` Ah, United 232, if you can not make the airport, sir, there is an interstate that runs north to south to the east side of the airport. It's a four-lane interstate.'' `` We're just passing it right now,'' <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> responds. `` We're going to try for the airport. At 3:58 p.m., <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> to <PERSON> Bachman </PERSON>: `` Have runway in sight. We'll be with you very shortly. Thanks a lot for your help.'' <PERSON> Bachman </PERSON> gives <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> figures on wind speed and direction and tells him, `` You're cleared to land on any runway.'' <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> chuckles, breaking the tension for a brief moment. He quips, `` You want to be particular, and make it a runway, huh?'' <PERSON> Bachman </PERSON> tells <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> about a runway on the same path as the plane that has been closed because of lack of use. `` We're pretty much lined up on this one, or we think we'll be,'' <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> says. At 3:59 p.m., <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> asks <PERSON> Bachman </PERSON> for the length of the unused runway and is told it is 6,600 feet. He's also told assembled rescue vehicles are being cleared from it. `` At the end of the runway, it's just a wide open field,'' <PERSON> Bachman </PERSON> says. `` So, sir, the length wo n't be a problem.'' Four seconds later, <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> replies: `` OK'' Eight seconds later _ at 45 seconds after 3:59 p.m. _ a ground proximity warning horn on the plane goes off. A voice says, `` Pull up, pull up.'' The tape goes silent. United 232 is down.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration says it's premature to consider increasing economic aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> as the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION> nation moves to install its first non-communist government in more than 40 years The traveling White House of vacationing President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> issued a guarded reaction Friday to news that a Solidarity activist would be named prime minister. `` It's going to take a good deal of patience and determination, persistence -LRB- for any government -RRB- to carry out an economic reform program that will turn things around there,'' said press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` We will continue to watch the process and will increase aid as appropriate and as we can,'' he said about the possibility of more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to encourage pluralistic leanings. `` It's really premature to think along those lines,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, adding that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> budget constraints mean `` we do n't have a lot of money to offer.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced an aid package totaling $ 119 million during his trip to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> last month. The president was keeping abreast of the situation in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and elsewhere while on his vacation in this resort town. Today, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was to have his speed boat, <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION>, inspected by the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. The White House arranged a high-profile inspection, with the president receiving a safety certificate and making remarks as a public service announcement on boat safety. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration was still waiting to see how events unfold in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` It's too early at this point to know how they -LRB- <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s leaders -RRB- are going to make it work, let alone how it will work,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters Without delving into specific analysis of the events, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> for the second consecutive day indicated the administration is pleased with the general direction of events in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. On Thursday, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> had described <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s move toward a non-communist government as `` remarkable and history making.'' Privately, administration officials said they were pleased that Polish President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> had chosen Solidarity journalist <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, a close associate of Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, to be prime minister. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> continued to vigorously enjoy his vacation, which began Wednesday. He went boating and golfing with family members visiting the family compound on <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s Point. All of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s five children and his grandchildren were on hand or were expected this weekend. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was cheery as he practiced his trademark rapid-fire golf style, finishing 18 holes in 1 hour and 51 minutes. As he teed off on the first hole, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> joked to watching reporters: `` The crowd is hushed. They sense that ` Mr. Smooth.' is back.'' `` Mr. Smooth'' is a favorite name <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> uses for himself when playing golf and horseshoes.

<HEAD>Relations on Upswing as Soviets, Cubans Loosen Ties</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's campaign to improve ties with <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> is getting a lift from reports that some 2,000 Cuban troops are preparing to leave the African nation. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> also is loosening its ties to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, but hundreds of Soviet advisers and East German military and security personnel apparently will remain after the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> withdrawal. The death in an airplane crash last week of Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat who was a strong friend of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> in his crusade against hunger, sparked a cooperative search that also is helping to improve <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations. Senior <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said they wanted to see the process accelerated. But, they said, two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions must be met. Those conditions are a continuing improvement in human rights and a serious effort by <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> to reconcile with separatists in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> region and an autonomous movement in <LOCATION> Tigray </LOCATION>. But in a brief statement Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it `` continues to support the territorial integrity of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>.'' That means the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is opposed to a separate Eritrean state. The prospect of Cuban troops leaving <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> is also welcome news to the administration. The Cubans are stationed in the <LOCATION> Ogaden </LOCATION> region, along the border with <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>. In 1978 and 1979, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> used a force of 12,000 to 17,000 Cubans along with Soviet advisers to expel troops from <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>. The remaining Cubans mostly are on sentry duty. There is no sign that <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> intends to become embroiled again in a conflict with <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. Diplomatic sources, declining to be identified, said all the Cubans apparently would be withdrawn. While <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> does not receive foreign aid, it is eligible for humanitarian assistance. During a 1988 famine, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> provided about $ 120 million _ the largest outlay to any African country that year. The fact that there are about 2,000 political prisoners in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> is considered a much larger obstacle to friendlier <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations than the governing Marxist philosophy in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>.

 Progress is being reported in strikes against two regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> telephone companies, but union officials in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> are trying to turn up the financial pressure on companies there. The <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> Telephone should pay customers the money it was n't paying striking workers. The company said no, it has to pay overtime to managers filling in for strikers and probably was losing revenue to competitors. Telephone operators at <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> asked customers to delay paying their telephone bills during the strike. Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION>, which serves five Midwestern states, said using customers in the week-long walkout was `` irresponsible.'' Some progress was reported in talks local companies held with <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, a day after the union reached agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION>. Bell of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> was to begin talks today with the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION>, whose members have been on strike for two weeks. On the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telesis </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> also reported substantial progress toward a new contract. Wages and employee contributions to health-insurance plans have been major issues blocking settlement of the contracts with the four companies' nearly 200,000 employees in 20 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. The striking workers include operators, telephone installers and repairmen, factory workers and some sales and clerical personnel. All four companies have continued service using management personnel, but there have been delays for installation and operator services. The Bell Atlantic-CWA agreement resolved regional issues, while leaving local issues to be decided in further talks. Philadelphia-based <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> also was bargaining separately with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>. Union officials at <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> said 41,000 striking workers wo n't return to work until all local issues are resolved and the 11,000 workers represented by the <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> settle. But both sides said a final accord could be reached within days. <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telesis </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Saviano </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> and company negotiators made `` very substantial progress,'' but unresolved issues remained. No new talks have been scheduled in the <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION> strike. Five people were arrested Friday outside <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> after <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> members blocked building entrances. Those arrested were issued summonses and released. A picketer was arrested at a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION> facility near <LOCATION> Saginaw </LOCATION> after strikers blocked a driveway. The 37-year-old woman was charged with obstructing traffic, a misdemeanor, and freed on $ 100 bond. In <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> workers are striking <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of New York-based <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION>, union officials said the regional company stood to save $ 3.1 million from 1989 through 1992 if it's successful in shifting some costs of health insurance to its employees. `` This money will not be translated into lower phone bills for <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> customers because local rates are frozen,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> economist. `` Instead, the $ 3.1 million will flow directly as profits to <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION>'s subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fortier </PERSON>, business manager of <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> Local 2326, said union officials also wanted rebates to <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> phone customers `` to reflect <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION>'s decreased expenses on wages and benefits during the bargaining impasse.'' <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonomo </PERSON> said: `` We're not doing this to save money. We're asking employees to pick up part of the health-care costs because the costs are escalating so much we ca n't keep pace ourselves.'' <PERSON> Bonomo </PERSON> said the company was incurring increased expenses in overtime paid to managers filling in for striking workers and probably was losing revenues to competitors. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenefick </PERSON> said the union wanted telephone customers to `` put telephone bills on hold.'' `` Our focus now is going to be biting into their income, asking people to put bills on hold,'' <PERSON> Kenefick </PERSON> said, adding that he does n't believe there's much risk of customers losing service if they withhold payment <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, called it `` irresponsible to use customers in a management-union dispute.''

Of the 296 people aboard Flight 232, 185 survived and 111 were killed. The tape, covering about 36 minutes of relevant interchanges, was released Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. 3:23 p.m. CDT _ <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> controllers to <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> controllers: <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, got an emergency for you. <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>: All right. <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>: I've got a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> aircraft coming in, lost No. 2 engine, having a hard time controlling the aircraft right now. He's out of 29,000 right now and descending to <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Right now he's east of your VOR but he wants the equipment standing by right now ...

As soon as I get comfortable, I'll ship him over to you and he'll be in your control. <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>: All right. 3:26 p.m. _ <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> 232: <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> approach, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> 232 Heavy -LRB- wide body -RRB-, with you out of 26 -LRB- 26,000 feet altitude -RRB-. Heading right now is 290 and we've got about a 500-foot rate of descent. ... OK, so you know we have almost no control ability, very little elevator and almost no aileron. We are controlling the turns by power. ... We can only turn right, but we ca n't turn left.'' <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>: <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> 232 Heavy, understand, sir, you can only make right turns. 3:27 p.m. _ <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>: <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> 232 </LOCATION>, ... your present track puts you about 8 miles north of the airport, sir, and the only way we can get you around to -LRB- runway -RRB- 31 is a slight left turn with differential power or, if you can, jockey it over. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> 232: OK, we're in a right turn now. That's about the only way we can go. We'll be able to make very slight left turns on final, but right now just going to make right turns to whatever heading you want. 3:29 p.m. _ <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>: <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 232 </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION>, say souls on board and fuel remaining. 3:32 p.m. _ <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> 232: We have no hydraulic fluid, which means we have no elevator control, almost none, and very little aileron control. I have serious doubts about making the airport. Have you got some place near there that we might be able to ditch? Unless we get control of this airplane, we're going to put it down wherever it happens to be. <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>: United 232, roger.

We've got the elevators pretty much under control within 300 or 400 feet, but we still ca n't do much with the steering. <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>: <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> 232 Heavy, roger, understand you do have the elevators possibly under control. Will you be able to hold the altitude? <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> 232: Negative. We do n't have it. We are better, that's all. <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>: <PERSON> Roger </PERSON>. 3:46 p.m. _ <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> 232: OK, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> 232, we're starting a left turn back to the airport. Since we have no hydraulics, braking is really going to be a problem. Ah, we suggest the equipment be toward the far end of the runway and I think under the circumstances, regardless of the condition of the airplane, when we stop, we're going to evacuate So you might notify the ground crew equipment that we're going to do that. <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>: <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> 232 Heavy, wilco sir, and if you can continue that left turn to a 220 heading, sir, that will take you right to the airport. 3:51 p.m. _ <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>: <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> 232 Heavy, you are going to have to widen out just slightly to your left, sir, to make the turn to final and also to take you away from the city. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> 232: Whatever you do, keep us away from the city. 3:53 p.m. _ <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>: <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> 232 Heavy, been advised there's a four-lane highway up in that area, sir, if you can pick that up. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> 232: OK, we'll see what we can do here. We've already put the gear down, and we're going to have to put it down on something solid if we can. 3:54 p.m. _ <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> 232: We've got about three or four minutes to go, it looks like. <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>: <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> 232 Heavy, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON>.

But we're going to need you southbound away from the city first, it you can hold a 180 heading. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> 232: We're trying to get to it right now ... OK, we're 180 degrees heading, now what do you want? 3:56 p.m. _ <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>: ... That heading will put you, oh, currently 15 miles northeast of the airport. If you can hold that, it will put you on about three-mile final. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> 232: OK, we're giving it heck. 3:57 p.m. _ <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>: <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> 232 Heavy, the airport's currently 12 o'clock and 13 miles. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>: OK, we're looking for it. <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>: Ah, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> 232 Heavy, if you can not make the airport, sir, there is an interstate that runs north to south to the east side of the airport. It's a four-lane interstate. 3:58 p.m. _ <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>: We're just passing it right now. We're going to try for the airport. <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>: <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> 232 Heavy, roger, and advise when you get the airport in sight. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> 232: Have runway in sight.

<HEAD>Government Cuts Estimate of Undiscovered Oil Resources</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Undiscovered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil supplies are far smaller than estimated early in this decade, although prospects in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> have brightened, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says. A department report released Friday said 49 billion barrels of crude oil outside known fields could, if found, be developed with existing technology. At the current price of $ 18 a barrel, however, only two-thirds of the total would be economic to produce, it said. In its most recent previous estimate in 1981, the department estimated 83 billion barrels of undiscovered crude. One barrels equals 42 gallons. Throughout the decade, the amount of known <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil reserves has held steady at about 30 billion barrels and production has remained near 3 billion barrels yearly. Thus, the new estimate of undiscovered resources means the life expectancy of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil resources _ except unconventional sources such as oil shales and tar sands _ has dropped to 26 years. The 1981 figures implied a life expectancy of 37 years. `` The change is significant,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION>'s office of energy and marine biology. The survey produced the report in collaboration with the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Minerals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> A key reason for the lower estimate of undiscovered oil resources, the report said, is the failure in recent years of drilling prospects once thought to be promising. `` The massive exploration effort of industry of the late 1970s and early 1980s simply did not confirm some of the geological expectations,'' the report said. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said in an interview that some of the most significant drilling disappointments were in the Overthrust Belt in the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> area and off the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. Although prospects have dimmed in some offshore <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> areas, that state overall has become the most promising development area for oil in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the report said. The report estimated 13.2 billion barrels of oil are recoverable in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, compared with a 1981 estimate of 6.9 billion barrels. The increase is due largely to new geological data on the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Coastal Plain, the site of the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION>. Industry is trying to persuade <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to open the refuge to oil exploration. The report said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has an estimated 399 trillion cubic feet of undiscovered natural gas, down from the 1981 estimate of 594 trillion cubic feet. The amount of undiscovered natural gas liquids, such as butane and propane, was cut in half, to 9 billion barrels. In response to the report, Deputy Energy Secretary <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said new technologies, such as horizontal drilling, will significantly increase the amount of oil and gas that eventually can be developed. `` Even after considering all these factors, there clearly is a decline,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said in a statement. `` This is all the more reason why we must proceed with a national energy strategy to contend with declining domestic production and increasing imports.''

<HEAD>Court Blocks New Cost Formula For Foreclosures</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The lending industry, winning a preliminary victory in its fight with the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> over who will pay for a growing number of VA mortgage defaults, says the agency's refusal to bid on foreclosed property cost the industry $ 200 million last year. In a temporary injunction granted Friday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Revercomb </PERSON> said he agreed with the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> could not use its borrowing costs from the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> in determining whether to buy and hold foreclosed property until it could be resold. The alternative to having VA acquire the property is for the lender to be left with it, with the VA paying the lender the maximum guarantee amount of $ 36,000. A hearing on a permanent injunction remains to be scheduled and probably wo n't be heard for several months, the industry group said. The new regulation had been scheduled to take effect Monday. The group, which represents 2,200 members of the mortgage lending industry, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had `` considered and rejected'' the interest cost deduction when it told <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> to acquire fewer foreclosed properties. <PERSON> Revercomb </PERSON> said he agreed that `` the cost of funds in the net value definition is a clear violation of the controlling federal statute'' enacted in 1984 to help control the deficit. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> required <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> to calculate the net worth of property by taking its fair market value _ the price it would command in the present real estate market _ and subtracting a variety of costs. The VA would not repurchase homes that it would have to sell at a loss. Under the veterans' loan program, the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> guarantees to the mortgage lender that it will pay 40 percent or 50 percent of the mortgage debt if the borrower defaults, up to the maximum. Until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> acted, <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> bought the foreclosed property in nearly every case, `` even when it did not make financial sense to do so,'' <PERSON> Revercomb </PERSON> said. Neither VA nor the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would comment immediately on the ruling. Foreclosures on VA-backed loans have risen sharply in recent years, due largely to the real estate slump in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an arm of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, says six lenders that had financial problems linked to the so-called `` no-bids'' defaulted in 1988. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget message this year estimated the new regulation would result in 10 percent fewer property acquisitions. The industry group says its average loss on a piece of property <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> does not acquire is more than $ 18,000. A July General Accounting Office report said foreclosures rose from 13,729 in fiscal 1981 to 43,316 in 1987. In those same two years, <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> annual losses rose from $ 51 million to $ 615 million, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. The report by <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, supported the idea of including the interest costs.

<HEAD>USDA Raises Estimate of Farmers' Net Cash Income</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says farmers' 1989 net cash income will be $ 2 billion more than anticipated a month ago, but the forecast is still short of last year's record. The latest monthly estimate by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, released Friday, says net cash income is expected to be in the range of $ 52 billion to $ 57 billion, compared with $ 50 billion to $ 55 billion predicted in July. Last year, because of rising commodity prices because of the drought-shriveled harvest, net cash income was a record $ 59.9 billion. That figure was also revised upward from last month's estimate of $ 58 billion for 1988 income Net cash income is the amount farmers have to spend during the year and represents the difference between gross cash income and cash expenses. For example, 1988 sales of grain stored from harvests in earlier years were counted as part of the 1988 gross. Another method of <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> bookkeeping measures `` net farm income'' for the calendar year, not simply the cash-in, cash-out system involved in `` net cash income.'' By this alternate method, changes in the value of farm inventories are taken into consideration and allowances are made for `` non-money'' items such as depreciation, the family consumption of farm-grown foods and the net rental value of dwellings. Net farm income in 1989 was forecast at $ 48 billion to $ 53 billion, up $ 1 billion from projections in July. In 1988, net farm income was reported at $ 45.7 billion, which was revised up from $ 44 billion a month ago. One reason for net cash income being down from the record 1988 level is that farmers have put more land back into production this year, meaning larger expenses for field preparation, weed control and harvesting. Also, government payments to farmers are down sharply this year. `` Forecasters are divided on whether the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy is headed for a brief slowdown or a downturn,'' the report said. `` Agriculture is likely to find the general economy mildly supportive in either case. Lower interest rates and perhaps lower exchange rates, common to both outlooks, would reduce farm costs and boost agricultural exports.'' Consumer food prices are expected to rise 5 percent to 7 percent, on average, compared with a 4.1 percent gain in 1988. Most of the expected increase took place in the first half of 1989, the report said. The agency said wheat and rice prices are likely to rise, although overall grain and soybean production `` will increase markedly'' from 1988, despite a heavy toll from poor weather.

 <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, a central figure in the investigation into the scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> who was summoned to her doorstep by a group of protesters, says if she did something wrong she'll try to make it right. The protesters who gathered Friday morning in front of <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>'s town house in <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> accomplished something <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been unable to do _ get <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> to talk about the influence-peddling scandal `` If I've done something wrong, I'm completely willing to try to make it right,'' said the one-time executive assistant to former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. About 20 people gathered outside <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>'s home, and one shouted: `` We want to talk to you about <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` Thanks, but no thanks,'' said <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, who took the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination when called before a congressional panel investigating <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. `` I've had enough,'' she said. `` So have we,'' shouted members of the group mobilized by the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Now </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ACORN </ORGANIZATION>. So, barefoot and wearing jeans and blouse turned inside out, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> came to the doorstep and spoke politely with her unexpected visitors. She repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. `` I do n't have a single personal friend who ever got something from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said, referring to reports that she approved <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> loans to unworthy projects pushed by well-connected Republicans. `` I liked <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. He was a good person ... but I think there might have been people there who have done things they are trying to hide.'' One person asked about a program to subsidize rehabilitation of housing for people with moderate incomes. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> responded that the money `` all went to low and moderate housing except for a couple of cases.'' The group alerted a <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reporter, who was present for the confrontation. The group was led by <PERSON> Alberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON>, who lives in a public housing project in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We are the people who live in the low-income neighborhoods that suffered as you gave precious <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> resources away to your friends,'' <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> read from a letter. `` Can you lend us some money? We need to fix up those abandoned houses in our neighborhoods so we can get rid of the crack dealers you have allowed to move in.'' <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> nodded, `` OK, OK, I do n't blame you.'' She later pleaded with the crowd, `` I really loved my years at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. I spent all my time on Fair Housing. But you would n't know that from the press ... I'm really, really, really sorry. I wish you knew me and what I tried to do at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. ... `` I've been made such a scapegoat. This is what I wanted to do the rest of my life,'' she said. `` And when I walk into <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> now, people turn the other way.''

 A gunman assassinated a leading presidential hopeful at a political rally Friday night, the mayor of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> said. It was the latest in a series of attacks by drug traffickers, police said. The assassin opened fire on Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON> as the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate was about to give a speech before 10,000 people in <LOCATION> Soacha </LOCATION>, 20 miles south of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. At least 10 others were wounded. After the attack President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> used his powers under the nation's state of siege to re-establish a treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to extradite suspected drug traffickers. <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, 46, died of several gunshot wounds to the chest, said <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastrana </PERSON>. <PERSON> Galan </PERSON> had escaped an assassination attempt Aug. 5 in the city of <LOCATION> Medillin </LOCATION> by drug traffickers, who police said had offered $ 500,000 to kill him. Police also blamed the Friday attack on drug lords. <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, who had been one of six <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidates seeking the presidential party's nomination for the May 1990 president, was widely considered the front-runner to replace <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>. Photographer <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> said two shots hit <PERSON> Galan </PERSON> in the stomach as he was about to give his speech at the rally. `` When the individual began firing, -LRB- <PERSON> Galan </PERSON> -RRB- fell to the ground,'' said photographer <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> said two shots hit <PERSON> Galan </PERSON> in the stomach, but he maintained consciousness `` and asked only that he be taken quickly to the hospital.'' At least 10 others were wounded, including one of <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>'s bodyguards, two local political leaders and supporters near the podium The crowd panicked. `` The people were running, screaming and crying,'' said <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>. The gunman escaped, and police mounted a search. Barco, in an address broadcast nationwide on television and radio, said he would renew the extradition treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which was suspended by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on a technicality in April 1988. He said his government would take emergency measures to stop the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, which is responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine that reaches the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. They include hiring special judges to investigate drug traffickers and detaining suspects for a week without a hearing. The attack came hours after drug traffickers shot to death a provincial police chief who had led a campaign against the drug traffickers based in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel claimed responsibility for the slaying of Col. <PERSON> Waldemar </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> in calls to local radio stations. Friday's attacks came amid a strike by the nation's judges, who are protesting the violence and they say is a lack of protection for members of their profession. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> recently had given up his official bodyguards and asked that they instead be assigned to protect judges. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>, 46, police commander for <LOCATION> Antioquia </LOCATION> province where <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> is located, left his home Friday in his chauffeur-driven car that had gone about 450 feet when it was cut off by another car and five gunmen emerged, officials said. `` They fired without mercy for several minutes at the colonel, who was hit more than a hundred times,'' an unidentified witness told <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION>. The witness said the chauffeur also was injured. Witnesses said <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>'s car was destroyed by gunfire. The interior was covered with blood. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> directed the local campaign against cocaine trafficking and led several major raids that resulted in the seizure of tons of the drug and the arrest of several dealers. On Wednesday night, Magistrate <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Valencia </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> was shot to death in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, hours after rejecting appeals filed on behalf of two <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> leaders. On Thursday night, an armed band intercepted a police van carrying 18 arrested people and set them free. They included several suspected drug traffickers, officials said. `` It's terrifying what is happening in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>,'' said Justice Minister <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Grieff </PERSON>. `` The only way to confront this challenge is by fighting together, the government, judges, the armed forces and the citizenry to stop the wave of violence,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> says the fear of catching Lyme disease from tick bites is causing people to use insect repellents in potentially harmful ways. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates the pesticides used in insect repellents, said Friday that misuse of repellents could result in adverse skin reactions, headaches, mood changes and possibly convulsions or unconsciousness. Only a `` small number'' of reports of ill effects have been received, but they have prompted `` concern that fear of Lyme disease or the use of repellents for other biting pests may result in misuse or overuse of these products,'' the agency said. <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Georgeson </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> S.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Wax </PERSON>, manufacturer of the insect repellent `` Off,'' said the company endorsed the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> advisory because `` it's very important to have people continue to use these products properly.'' Among the suggestions from the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> are: _ Apply repellents only to exposed skin and not under clothing _ Never use repellents over cuts, wounds or irritated skin _ Take care to keep repellents away from the eyes and mouth or the hands of small children _ Avoid frequent reapplication or saturation of the skin One application is good for four to six hours, depending on strength, says Ms. <PERSON> Georgeson </PERSON>. _ After returning indoors, wash repellent-treated skin with soap and water, especially if repellents have been used repeatedly during the day

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is expanding its recent ban on ostrich imports to include emus, rheas and cassowaries because they may carry disease-bearing parasites. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON>, acting administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday that the expanded import ban was effective immediately and would remain indefinitely. The flightless birds affected are known as ratites and include ostriches, emus, rheas and cassowaries. Agency spokeswoman <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON> said the ban did not apply to penguins because those are of a different family. Neither will the ban affect kiwis, because the bird's homeland, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, does not permit exports, she said. <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON> said the crackdown on imports was prompted by the discovery earlier this year of 18 exotic ticks on adult ostriches in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The ticks were identified as African Bont and Bont-legged ticks, which are known to transmit heartwater, an often fatal disease of cattle, sheep, goats and other ruminants.

 <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> may not be a household name, but the idea of the Solidarity newspaper editor running the government drew positive responses from Poles desperate for economic change. `` I think he's a pretty wise man. But he takes the post in tough times, so it's hard to be an optimist,'' said a transport company clerk. On Friday, <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> declared that he was ready to accept President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s offer to nominate him as prime minister and end the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s 45-year hold on government leadership. A formal announcement was expected today. If chosen, <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s first task should be to put a halt to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s rising three-digit inflation, said the clerk, who added that he earns $ 74 a month. `` Inflation causes pessimism among people and they are terrified by what is going on,'' he said Friday. A group of young people sitting in front of a department store on a balmy summer night seemed less sure of the future. `` A Solidarity government will surely change something, but it is not clear in what direction,'' said a 16-year-old high school student. Asked what they thought of <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, one of Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s closest advisers, one replied: `` It's the first time I have heard his name. The group seemed to prefer <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> is a person who can get something from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> on financial and political matters,'' said one student. Last week, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he was ready to offer himself as a candidate for prime minister, but later said he would rather remain with the working masses. Outside a bank, independent dealers speculated on politics. `` A Solidarity prime minister is the only way out. It's the only thing that can gain real social support,'' said one dealer, clutching a thick wad of zlotys, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s currency. `` If that does n't work, then it's going to be bloody here,'' chimed in another dealer in front of the <ORGANIZATION> PKO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in central <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> -RRB- is a wise person and he knows what he wants,'' added a third dealer. `` He served a prison term. The country is an absolute pit. There is no other way out.'' However, he seemed skeptical about the prospects of democracy in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> if the Communists are allowed to hang on to the defense and interior ministries. `` -LRB- Those ministries -RRB- should also be in the hands of Solidarity if anything is going to change. They could be under civilian control like in other countries,'' he said. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> seemed to appeal as a prime minister to hurried shoppers and early evening strollers in a busy commercial area of downtown <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. But some were too weary from the daily battle to make ends meet to care. `` We're so tired, it really does n't matter what happens,'' said a 21-year old teacher. Some thought the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would be reluctant to relinquish power. `` It seems to me the party wo n't allow everything to be taken away. They have been here too long and they are too deep into this,'' said an employee of a private company. One thing was sure. A Solidarity prime minister was a new thing and that aroused curiosity even among those with almost no interest in politics. `` There has to be something new, something people can believe in,'' said the head of a private tourist agency who had just returned from <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>.

 In a nation plagued by chronic shortages, it was not surprising that the car used by the man expected to be the next prime minister ran out of gas. After meeting Friday with <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, who appeared prepared to nominate him for prime minister, Solidarity editor <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> drove to see Roman Catholic Primate <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>. On the way back from the meeting, his car _ a Polonez belonging to the weekly newspaper that <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> edits _ ran out of gas, briefly stranding him and his driver until he borrowed another car. When asked by reporters about the difficulties he would face by becoming the prime minister in economically troubled <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> replied: `` My biggest problem, if I may joke, is that I ran out of gas.'' `` For the premier-to-be, it is not very proper,'' he said. Long gasoline lines in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> make it difficult to fill up in a hurry. By the time he reached the parliament building for a meeting with other leaders in the independent Solidarity movement, not surprisingly, <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> was feeling the pressure. Asked who he would have in his government, he said: `` I have to think for a while. There is no time, but still I need some time.'' As TV cameras turned away, <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> seemed relieved. `` Oh finally, I can have a smoke,'' he said.

 A 3-week-old labor dispute ended Friday after the governor of <LOCATION> Tamaulipas </LOCATION> state negotiated an agreement between rival union factions, the director of a business organization said. The resolution means the northeastern state of <LOCATION> Tamaulipas </LOCATION> will have its first major labor union independent of the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>. `` The -LRB- strike -RRB- flags are coming down right at this moment,'' <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> McAllen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday afternoon. <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, is across the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Reynosa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> offered no details on the agreement, other than to call it a victory for the head of a local union, <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, who had pulled his union out of the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>. According to the governor's spokesman, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Save </PERSON>, the new union will be an affiliate of the federation but will be free to choose its own leaders and set its own policy. Business leaders said earlier Friday that the union was to be independent. Talks on forming a new union are scheduled to begin next week. The strike pitted <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> against local federation leader <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, who called the strike on July 25 and said he took over <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>'s local. The labor board, controlled by the federation, then authorized <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> as union leader. The strike closed 15 plants, idled 2,000 workers and cost the plants about $ 500,000 a day in lost production. At least 800 workers of the 2,000 affected by the strike rebelled against <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> on Tuesday, ripping down the strike flags, returning to work and locking themselves inside their plants. Plant managers had refused to sign contracts with <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, whom they accuse of corruption. At least two plants threatened to pull out of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Tamaulipas Gov. <PERSON> Americo </PERSON> <PERSON> Villareal </PERSON> met with plant managers, rival union factions and business leaders Thursday and Friday before resolving the stalemate. `` The governor of the state of <LOCATION> Tamaulipas </LOCATION> deserves a lot of credit,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` He said enough of this corruption. He took a very positive stand and negotiated this.'' <PERSON> Villareal </PERSON> could not be reached for comment late Friday. The Mexican <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> is the nation's largest and most-powerful labor organization and is a pillar of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The foreign-owned border plants, known as maquiladoras, take advantage of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s lower labor costs to assemble products for export to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The maquiladora industry is a key source of jobs and investment for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.

 Polish immigrants celebrated the news that a Solidarity activist had been named prime minister, but like their compatriots back home were wary of the intentions of the Polish communist authorities. `` From what we know of the communists, they do n't give up power without a struggle,'' said <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Prusek </PERSON>, who owns a travel agency in the Polish community on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s northwest side. `` But now we need to know what form that struggle will take _ will it be in the parliament?''

At this time last year Solidarity was illegal. `` The changes in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> have come around so fast that no one could have predicted one year ago, or even six months ago, that it would come to pass,'' said <PERSON> Kazimierz </PERSON> <PERSON> Olejarczyk </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Polish-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hamtramck </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> activist and journalist who spent time in jail for his anti-government activities, will have to convince Poles to make huge sacrifices in coming months if he wants to succeed and get <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economy back on track, said <PERSON> Mira </PERSON> <PERSON> Puacz </PERSON>, owner of a Polish-language bookstore in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wlodzimierz </PERSON> <PERSON> Dziubek </PERSON>, who moved to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> four years ago, said he feared things in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> would get worse. `` It'll be a repeat of'80 and'81,'' <PERSON> Dziubek </PERSON> said, referring to the imposition of martial law in December 1981 that ended a 16-month period after its creation in which Solidarity flourished. <PERSON> Dziubek </PERSON>, noting <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s sad history of failed reforms, said he would not go home. `` How many times have they said in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> that they'll change and there'll be democratization?'56,'70,'80 _ this is the fourth time.'' While some people expressed fear of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s reaction to a non-communist government in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pucinski </PERSON> said Soviet intervention is unlikely. `` The winds of change are just too strong,'' <PERSON> Pucinski </PERSON> said. `` I think it's too late. It's too late for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to react in any forceful way.'' Considering the dire state of the Polish economy, the communists may have no choice but to give Solidarity a chance to put things right, Ms. <PERSON> Puacz </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is devastated economically,'' she said. `` If they want to get out of the crisis, they need some kind of change.''

 Police are searching for three teen-age convicts after an 18-year-old gunman burst into the crowded pediatric ward of a city hospital and freed two companions. The gunman, an escapee from the <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, waved a .357 magnum handgun and told doctors and patients at D.C. General Hospital Thursday afternoon that he would shoot unless the two teens were freed, witnesses and police said. `` He just came in out of nowhere with the gun and pointed at the two young men in chains and said, ` You let them go or I'm going to start shooting,''' said a pediatrician who asked not to be identified. `` It was extremely dangerous. Nothing like this has ever happened here before.'' As the gunman, identified by police as <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilliard </PERSON>, threatened to open fire, some mothers `` just scooped up their children and left,'' said one witness, while others ducked for cover or sat terrified in their seats until the trio fled. No shots were fired and no one was injured. The two youths had been taken to the hospital for medical treatment, but officials did not reveal their specific complaints. <PERSON> Hilliard </PERSON> had been serving time at <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> since March 1987 for armed robbery and homicide, sources said. He escaped in late July after being sent to D.C. General for treatment of an illness that authorities believe was faked. The youths who fled the hospital with <PERSON> Hilliard </PERSON> were identified as <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, 18, who was incarcerated at <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> in July for an assault with a dangerous weapon conviction, and <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 16, who had been held since March for first-degree murder while armed.

<HEAD>Calls to AIDS Hot Lines Up Following AZT News</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSEPH NEFF</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Calls to AIDS hot lines in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> increased following reports that the drug AZT can delay the deadly disease's onset, as callers also sought information about testing for the virus. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s hot line had a 25 percent jump in calls Friday, said its director, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Troise </PERSON>. The Gay Men's <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crisis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> added an extra counselor to its hot line to handle the increased load of calls; most of those who called were asking where they could be tested rather than about AZT, said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, director of that hot line. `` This new AZT story has tipped the scales for people who had n't decided yet whether to get tested,'' <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> said On Thursday, Dr. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, the federal health and human services secretary, announced that AZT, azidothymidine, has proven effective in halting the progression of AIDS in people infected with the HIV virus but who have shown no symptoms. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> characterized the findings as the turning point in the battle to change acquired immune deficiency syndrome from a fatal disease to a treatable one. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, organizations reported more questions about the availability of AZT than about testing. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> AIDS Foundation Hotline and the hot line for Project Inform both reported a moderate but steady increase in calls Friday. An operator for the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> described the more hopeful environment: `` Previously, people might say, ` Why be tested? So I can know I'm going to die?' Now we can tell them there's a reason.'' A study among homosexual or bisexual males _ the largest risk group _ suggests that up to 99 percent of those infected will eventually develop the disease. Both <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> have significant homosexual populations. `` There has been a modest increase in interest from people for procuring AZT, and we expect that to be pretty steady over the next several weeks,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrow </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, the region's largest AIDS organization. `` The news from the government was sort of blunted in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> by the fact this has sort -LRB- of -RRB- been known for some time to just about everybody involved.'' Still, <PERSON> Sonna </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where the school operates an AIDS Activities <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, Friday reported no discernible increase in the number of people seeking AZT treatment. She suspects that many HIV-infected people in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> had already decided whether they should be taking AZT, citing extensive media coverage of the drug over the last six months. With health experts now saying it is crucial for people at risk of contracting AIDS to be tested for HIV and receive AZT if it can help them, the news also raised questions about how to promote widespread voluntary testing and who will pay for the drug treatment. A large number of AIDS patients do n't have health insurance and are ineligible for the government's Medicare or Medicaid benefits. Patients spend $ 3,000 to $ 8,000 a year for the drug, depending on the dosage. `` The major task that lies before us now is to make sure that this and other preventative treatments are made available to all who need them,'' said Project Inform in a statement. `` To this end, we urge an immediate reduction in the price of AZT in light of the greatly increased market that this news creates.'' AZT is made by <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Shares of the firm's parent, <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, rose 32 percent Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on news of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's study, closing at $ The drug, developed jointly by government researchers and <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION>, is the only one licensed for AIDS treatment. The company estimates more than 20,000 people are paying for AZT and another 7,000 are getting it free in clinical trials. AIDS attacks the body's immune system and renders it incapable of protecting against infection. The disease is caused by the HIV virus and is spread most frequently through sexual contact, the sharing of needles and syringes, and from mother to newborn infant. New figures released Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> show there have been 102,621 cases of AIDS diagnosed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since 1981. A total of 59,391 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> patients have died.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> MD-80 landed safely after an engine came apart and spewed out a metal piece that smashed through the roof of an auto body shop, narrowly missing the manager. Flight 223 bound from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> returned to <LOCATION> Lambert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> less than 15 minutes after taking off Friday morning.

I just dived away. `` I had been walking that way. If I walked faster, I would have gotten nailed.'' <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said the 112 passengers on board were put on a flight for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where they would make connections for <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the plane could have been flown safely without the cowling but that the pilot probably did the right thing by aborting the flight. `` Given the fact that we have 19,000 flights per day in this country, we may have one report like this a month,'' <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said. A shower of metal was scattered across the roof of the body shop and along a street near the shop. No injuries were reported, and <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said the plane made a routine landing. <PERSON> Erp </PERSON> said the cone, about 2 feet long and weighing about 15 pounds, tore a 5-foot square hole in the shop's roof. He said <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> officials who reclaimed the debris were at the shop only briefly. `` They just took the cone and picked up some smaller pieces and left,'' Erp said. `` They did n't say a whole lot.

 Discovery of a magnetic field around <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> suggests the planet is enveloped by radiation belts, but <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> hopes they wo n't damage the Voyager 2 spacecraft as it flies past the planet. `` Right now I do n't think anyone is terribly alarmed,'' said <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>, Voyager project manager at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Similar radiation belts at Jupiter disrupted Voyager's internal clock, causing some of its instruments to make measurements at the wrong time. Today, <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON> was 2.74 billion miles from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and 5.01 million miles from <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, speeding toward the giant gas planet at 42,251 mph. The ship will make its closest approach to <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> at 8:59 p.m. PDT Thursday when it zooms about 3,000 miles over the cloudtops of the solar system's fourth-largest planet. The spacecraft was launched in 1977, and explored Jupiter in 1979, <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 and Uranus in 1986. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday that Voyager 2 detected intense, pulselike radio signals coming from <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> _ strong evidence the planet has a magnetic field. Radio waves are generated when high-speed electrically charged particles spiral into a planet's atmosphere along magnetic field lines. Mercury, <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, Jupiter, <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> and Uranus have magnetic fields. <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> and Mars do not. Whether <LOCATION> Pluto </LOCATION> has one is unknown, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said. Magnetic fields are thought to be generated by fluid motion in a planet's core. Molten iron in <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s core, for example, creates a magnetic field that traps charged particles in the <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> belts. Although dissimilar from the ionizing radiation found in a nuclear reactor, such fields of radiation can damage spacecraft electronics. So far at <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, `` there's nothing to indicate it -LRB- the radiation -RRB- is anything worse than we expected,'' said <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>. `` But time will tell.'' Existence of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s magnetic field suggests the planet has an aurora like <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s northern and southern lights, created when charged particles spiral along magnetic field lines toward a planet's poles. Further study of the magnetic field also should let scientists determine the exact length of a day on <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> _ now believed to be between 17 and 18 <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> hours _ and gain better understanding of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s internal structure, said <ORGANIZATION> Jet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Propulsion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Murrill </PERSON>. Voyager project scientist <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> has said he believes <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s hydrogen-helium outer atmosphere gradually gives way to a superhot slurry of hot water and rock closer to the planet's center. That would mean that <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, like neighboring Uranus, probably lacks a distinct boundary between the sky and sea. Some scientists believe radiation trapped by Uranus' magnetic field bombards that planet's moons and rings to turn them dark in color. <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s magnetic field may cause similar radiation darkening of the Neptunian moons and ring arcs, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> on Friday also released new photographs taken by <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON>. Blurry black-and-white images show markings on <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s largest moon, but `` it is still too early to tell if the features are clouds or features on <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>'s surface,'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said A color photo of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> shows complex, frequently changing weather patterns in its atmosphere, including high-altitude wispy clouds, a small cloud dubbed `` the scooter'' because it rotates quickly, and other clouds that appear as long streaks. In recent weeks, <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON> also has discovered four Neptunian moons besides two observed from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>; two partial rings, or ring arcs, of debris orbiting the planet; and atmospheric patterns similar to jet streams on Earth.

 In the spirit of the concert it's commemorating, an unofficial <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> reunion is slowly coming together with borrowed gear and donated services By late Friday night cars were lining all the roads leading to the farm where 400,000 people spent three days _ Aug. 15-17, 1969 _ listening to music, getting high and enduring shortages of food, water and hygienic outlets. Unlike the original <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> concert, no rock stars were within miles, but thousands of people were still pouring onto the site regarded as sacred ground to those nostalgic for the rock culture of the 1960s. Police estimate this weekend's gathering will attract up to 100,000 people, and by Friday some 35,000 had descended on the 49-acre farm 60 miles north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said Sgt. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kulick </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Sullivan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Most people were willing to pay a $ 5 `` donation'' to gain entrance to the farm, although there was no guarantee of entertainment. By Friday evening local musicians were performing on a makeshift stage using donated sound equipment powered by a donated generator. `` We had no idea it would grow into this,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, as he stood on the stage and gestured toward the crowd spread about the sloping field. <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, the unofficial coordinator of the unofficial event, said the project started earlier in the week with a handful of guitarists playing for a few dozen people. A three-day reunion concert, held 12 miles away at the Imperial Resort in <LOCATION> Swan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, flopped Thursday when only 250 people showed up to hear performers like <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> veteran <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, the vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, offered to move Friday night's concert to the <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> field, but <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> city officials would n't allow it. `` It's not going to happen,'' said town supervisor <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. `` There's enough frenzy here already.'' Authorities had made one drug arrest by Friday night and two people were hospitalized, one for a drug overdose and another for acute alchoholism. The urge to celebrate history's most famous rock' n' roll concert at its actual site and not at a <LOCATION> Catskill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> resort drew a cross-section of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> culture: hippies and ex-hippies, bikers, legions of Grateful Dead followers known as Dead-heads, businessmen on their lunch hour, middle-aged tourists, housewives and Hasidic Jews from nearby <LOCATION> Catskill </LOCATION> communities. `` My husband went to the first one and said we should go every day this week and we have,'' said <PERSON> Lorrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Maus </PERSON>, a 33-year-old mother from nearby <LOCATION> Youngsville </LOCATION> who brought her two children. Around them other children played, dogs chased each other and music from hundreds of car stereos and acoustic guitars filled the natural amphitheater, which was ringed by cars, buses, tents and vendors. <PERSON> Trevor </PERSON> <PERSON> Boustead </PERSON>, a veteran of <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>, fondly recalled the late <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Yasgur </PERSON>, on whose farm the original festival was held. `` That <PERSON> Yasgur </PERSON>, he was a good dude,'' <ORGANIZATION> Boustead </ORGANIZATION> said, recalling how the dairy farmer gave out free milk during the concert. `` Everybody's doing the same thing now. Everybody's still friendly. The only thing that's different is all the cars and tents.'' <PERSON> Yasgur </PERSON>'s farm now belongs to brothers <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> And </PERSON> <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelish </PERSON>, who were paying for half of the cost of providing water and portable toilets for the reunion gathering. `` This is not a commercial venture,'' <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelish </PERSON> said. Proceeds from the entrance donation will go toward cleaning and reseeding the field, he said. A local garbage company and a volunteer ambulance corps are lending their services free of charge, <PERSON> Gelish </PERSON> said.

 Gunmen assassinated a leading presidential hopeful and wounded at least 10 others at a political rally and police blamed drug traffickers. Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON> was slain Friday hours after drug lords shot to death a provinical police chief, police said. President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> responded to the murders by announcing a harsh crackdown on drug traffickers in the nation, home of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel. It is the world's largest cocaine ring and is believed responsible for 80 percent of the drug smuggled into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> said in an address broadcast nationwide on television and radio that he will use his powers under the nation's state of siege to re-establish a treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to extradite suspected drug traffickers. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> threw out the treaty in April 1988 on a technicality. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> said his government also will take other emergency measures to stop the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, including seizing assets and hiring special judges to investigate drug traffickers. <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, 46, had been one of six people seeking the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s nomination for the May 1990 presidential election and was widely considered the front-runner to replace <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> Police said drug traffickers had offered $ 500,000 for his murder. He was shot as he was about to give a campaign speech before 10,000 people in <LOCATION> Soacha </LOCATION>, 20 miles south of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. At least 10 others were wounded, including one of <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>'s bodyguards and two local political leaders, witnesses said. They said the shots were fired by a lone gunman, who escaped. The crowd panicked. `` The people were running, screaming and crying,'' said <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, a photographer. <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastrana </PERSON> said <PERSON> Galan </PERSON> died of several gunshot wounds to the chest. <PERSON> Galan </PERSON> had escaped an assassination attempt by drug traffickers Aug. 5 in the city of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. Police also blamed drug lords for Friday's attack, which came hours after the shooting death of a provincial police chief who had led a campaign against the drug lords in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel claimed responsibility for the slaying of Col. <PERSON> Waldemar </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> in calls to local radio stations. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>, 46, police commander for <LOCATION> Antioquia </LOCATION> province where <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> is located, recently had given up his official bodyguards and asked that they instead be assigned to protect judges. He left his home Friday in his chauffeur-driven car, which had traveled about 450 feet when it was cut off by another car and five gunmen emerged, officials said. `` They fired without mercy for several minutes at the colonel, who was hit more than a hundred times,'' an unidentified witness told <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION>. The witness said the chauffeur was injured. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> directed the local campaign against cocaine trafficking and led several major raids that resulted in the seizure of tons of the drug and the arrest of several dealers. The slayings were the latest in a series of attacks in the past month and came amid a national strike by judges, who walked out on Thursday demanding more protection from drug traffickers following the slaying of one of their colleagues. Magistrate <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Valencia </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> was fatally shot in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> on Wednesday, hours after rejecting appeals filed on behalf of two <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel leaders. `` It's terrifying what is happening in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>,'' Justice Minister <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Grieff </PERSON> said on Friday. `` The only way to confront this challenge is by fighting together, the government, judges, the armed forces and the citizenry to stop the wave of violence,'' she said. In the past 10 years, 23 judges have been assassinated and officials blame nearly all of the slayings on drug dealers.

<TEXT>
 Billionaire magazine publisher <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> celebrates his 70th birthday today with a party for 700 of his rich and famous friends. The guest list includes stars, socialities, princes, publishers, a former president, a couple of ex-kings and, of course, close chum <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. Forbes is throwing the party at his palace in this playground of the wealthy and plans to use three planes _ including the supersonic Concorde and his own <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727, `` The Capitalist Tool'' _ to shuttle in the lucky swells. The publisher of <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> magazine is estimated to be worth $ 1 billion. The cost of his party has been reported to be $ 2 million. The balding and bespectacled dean of jet-setters is perhaps best known for his iron-man endurance of the social swirl and his much-publicized fascination with motorcyles and hot-air ballooning. He even gave a purple <ORGANIZATION> Harley-Davidson </ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, to match her mauve eyes. Invitations to his birthday party have been coveted by glitterati for months. Those lucky enough to receive them include former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> and former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. Greek shipowner <PERSON> Stavros </PERSON> <PERSON> Niarchos </PERSON> will be in the company of two former kings, Constantine of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Simeon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, along with opera diva <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Sills </PERSON>. <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> also invited media colleagues such as television personalities <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, and publishers <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>. Other jet set guests include fashion designer <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, tobacco heiress <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> politicians from both sides of the aisle. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> also is expected. The setting for tonight's party is the Mendoub palace, once the digs of the royal governor. The palace, one of several of Forbes' dwellings around the world, serves most of the time as a museum. Housing his collection of tin soldiers, the palace is a popular destination for <LOCATION> Tangier </LOCATION> residents. Five huge tents have been set up on the 15-acre Moroccan-style garden surrounding the palace. Guests drew lots for tent assignments, with the lucky ones sharing the biggest tent with the birthday boy himself. His sons are to act as hosts at the other tents. Miss <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> did not have to stand for the lottery: She's guaranteed a spot near <LOCATION> Forbes </LOCATION> The two have been regular companions since Forbes' 39-year marriage ended in divorce in 1985. Each tent is furnished in true luxury, with priceless Moroccan furniture and thick carpets from <LOCATION> Rabat </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fez </LOCATION>. An army of Moroccan chefs will be working feverishly in the kitchen. Guests will dance to a local band playing Moroccan and Western tunes. <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> invited <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>'s ruler <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> II. But the king declined, instead inviting all of <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>' guests to a luncheon Sunday at the <ORGANIZATION> Tangier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Golf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>'s sons, Crown Prince <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> and <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Rachid </PERSON>, will go in their father's place. <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> ordered 120 men of his mounted guard to help provide protection for the guests. `` They're not just decorative,'' <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said. `` Those boys mean business.''

 Two women in a hijacked helicopter plucked two inmates from a <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> prison yard, but the escape attempt ended in a police shootout in a small town 400 miles away. The women were believed to be the wives of the two men freed at daybreak Friday. The four ordered the helicopter pilot to fly to a farmhouse, where they picked up a van. A police officer in <LOCATION> Holdrege </LOCATION>, a town of 5,600 in southwestern <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, spotted the van Friday evening. That began a nine-minute chase and gunbattle through a residential area that ended after the van had been surrounded. `` They picked a bad place for a shootout,'' said Police Chief <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. One of the escaped inmates, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, was shot in the hand in the battle. <LOCATION> Phelps </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Deputy Attorney <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> identified the four people in custody after the chase as <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 30, cellmate <PERSON> Freddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON>, 21, of the <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Pueblo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 26, and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON>, 41. Police recovered two 9mm pistols and a .38 - caliber The women rented the helicopter from <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, saying they wanted to take some photos of real estate near the prison in southern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kautzky </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> director. Once near the prison, one woman pulled a gun and ordered the pilot to land inside the compound, <PERSON> Kautzky </PERSON> said. Frustrated prison guards held their fire because they could not get a clear shot at the helicopter and feared that the pilot was being held hostage, said <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonough </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> corrections spokewoman. Authorities ordered an investigation to determine why a guard refused three orders from prison superintendent <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> to open fire on the helicopter. `` From the time the helicopter came into view, from the point of touchdown to takeoff, was 10 to 15 seconds,'' <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said. The pilot was found bound and gagged about 35 miles north of the medium-security state prison and the helicopter was found nearby after authorities received an anonymous telephone call. The chase began when a <LOCATION> Holdrege </LOCATION> police officer spotted the van and the shooting started after the van struck a police car head-on, <LOCATION> Phelps </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. `` After the first encounter they went down the street shooting houses and at people,'' he said. At least eight shots penetrated the windshield of the van, police said. The gunmen fired wildly, but there were no additional injuries, `` and that's just flat out a miracle,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` If all the bullets they were shooting were aimed at us, they were n't very good shots,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> State Patrol Sgt. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Nutt </PERSON> was standing by his car, which he was using as a roadblock, when the van approached. He headed for shelter behind a nearby house, but wound up diving for the pavement in a hail of bullets. `` They tell us in training that the average gun battle with a law enforcement officer lasts two and one-half seconds. I think we set some kind of record,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Holdrege </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Phelps </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's officers finally surrounded the rental van `` Their truck had taken some pretty substantial hits in strategic locations,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` One of the men was wounded and I think just did n't want to run anymore.'' The chase ended at 6:27 p.m. CDT and the bullet-shattered van sat in the middle of a wide, brick street in the business district of town. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was at <ORGANIZATION> Good </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Samaritan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kearney </LOCATION> with a shotgun pellet possibly lodged in a finger on his right hand, said <LOCATION> Phelps </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Dwayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> and one of the women were being held at the <LOCATION> Phelps </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>; the second woman was being held at <LOCATION> Holdrege </LOCATION> police headquarters, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. None of the four was formally charged, but all four would probably be in court Monday, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. `` We've got plenty to hold them on,'' he said. <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> was serving a four-year sentence for robbery and would have been eligible for parole in September 1991. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was sentenced for sexual assault, theft and criminal impersonation in a bad check charge; his parole eligibility date was October 1996.

<HEAD>Workers Return to Plants After Winning Right to Form Own Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REYNOSA, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Workers at 15 U.S.-owned assembly plants were back on the job today after a three-week strike that ended when they won the right to form their own union. The strike by about 2,000 workers ended Friday afternoon when the leaders of rival labor factions, plant managers and the labor arbitration board signed an agreement negotiated by <LOCATION> Tamaulipas </LOCATION> Gov. America <PERSON> Villareal </PERSON>. The strike cost the plants $ 500,000 a day, but management backed the workers in their battle against the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, and said the strike was a victory against union bossism and corruption. The Mexican <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> is <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s largest and most powerful labor group. The agreement gives the workers the right to form their own union and elect their own leaders even though the new union will ostensibly be an affiliate of the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Save </PERSON>, the governor's spokesman. Talks on forming a new union are to begin next week. The maquiladora industry, which takes advantage of cheap labor to assemble products for export to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, is a key source of jobs and investment, and the strike had raised fears that investor confidence in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> would erode. There are 230 maquiladora plants employing about 65,000 people in <LOCATION> Tamaulipas </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Conservative Group Says Anti-Bias Ruling Will Be Overturned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The lawyer for a group called Concerned Women for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> predicted the reversal of a ruling that required landlords to rent to an unmarried couple even though doing so was against their religious beliefs. The Fair Employment and <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday said the refusal to rent violated state laws against housing discrimination based on marital status. But the lawyer for the group, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorence </PERSON>, called the decision `` outrageous and gutless'' and said the courts would overturn it. The commission said it lacked authority to rule on the claim of a landlady in <LOCATION> Chico </LOCATION> and an identical claim by apartment owners in <LOCATION> Downey </LOCATION> that the rental order violated their freedom of religion. Because no <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> court has decided the religious issue, the commission said it has no power to find a constitutional exemption to the anti-bias laws. `` The marital status law is an ideological statement about sexual morality,'' said <PERSON> Lorence </PERSON>, who's representing the <LOCATION> Chico </LOCATION> landlady, <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` It's not really meant to solve a real housing problem. ... I think what the state's doing is punishing Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> for not agreeing with their position.'' He also noted that <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> allows its public universities to reserve student housing for married couples. `` The state will prosecute Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> for doing the very thing the state of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> does when it is the landlord,'' <PERSON> Lorence </PERSON> said. `` They're going to have a very, very rough time explaining that.'' But <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lew </PERSON>, who prosecuted the <PERSON> Chico </PERSON> case for the state Fair Employment and <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said the state was entitled to decide that married students had a special need for affordable housing without abandoning its ban on discrimination in other rentals. To exempt a property owner from that ban on the grounds of religious beliefs `` opens the floodgates to such practices as making a moral test on the provisions of goods and services,'' <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> said. He said he, like <PERSON> Lorence </PERSON>, was disappointed that the commission had not decided the religious issue. Courts in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> are also considering challenges to their laws forbidding housing discrimination based on marital status. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> courts have forbidden public housing agencies from excluding unmarried couples on `` moral'' grounds but have not yet ruled on religious objections by private owners. The commission ordered Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> to pay $ 454 to an unmarried couple, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Randall </PERSON>, for their costs in finding alternative housing, and $ 500 for emotional distress caused by her refusal to rent to them in April 1987. She was also ordered to stop discriminating against unmarried couples. The commission said Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a Presbyterian, believes unmarried sex is sinful and that she would be prevented from meeting her late husband in the hereafter if she rented an apartment to an unmarried couple. In the <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> case, <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> were ordered to pay $ 2,260 for economic losses and $ 6,000 for emotional distress to <PERSON> Verna </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> and to offer them the first available apartment. The commission said the couple was shocked by their rejection in February 1987, bickered and felt pressured to lie about their marital status in looking for other housing, and that Ms. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> lost sleep and had trouble at work. The Donahues are Roman Catholics and believe that sex outside marriage is a mortal sin, and Mrs. <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> further believes it is sinful to help someone else commit a sin, the commission said.

<TEXT>
 Seven months after the murder of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> corrections chief <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Francke </PERSON>, his brothers are pressing authorities to develop their theory that corrupt prison officials conspired to have <PERSON> Francke </PERSON> killed. Little information has surfaced on the killing since <PERSON> Francke </PERSON> was stabbed in the heart outside Corrections Department headquarters Jan. 17. No arrests have been made, but the death is still very much in the news. <PERSON> Francke </PERSON>'s brothers, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>, 46, and <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON>, 36, have found an ally in <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanford </PERSON>, a columnist for The Oregonian newspaper in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> who has devoted nearly two dozen columns to the <PERSON> Francke </PERSON> slaying. <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> said he thinks there's a good possibility the slaying was part of a conspiracy to prevent <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Francke </PERSON> from exposing an `` organized criminal element'' in the prison system that was involved in drugs and corruption. `` I think it's something that any good investigator has to look at again and again,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION>, who worked as a private investigator in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> in the early 1980s. Allegations of official corruption have irritated government officials, including Gov. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldschmidt </PERSON>, who at one point dismissed <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION>'s columns as `` b.s.'' and `` garbage.'' The man in charge of the investigation, <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Attorney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dale </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Francke </PERSON> brothers have produced no substantiation for their conspiracy theory. `` There's nothing wrong with raising it, but they've gone way beyond raising it,'' <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> said. `` They're saying, ` This is what happened.''' Police said <PERSON> Francke </PERSON>, 42, was attacked at about 7 p.m. as he was leaving work and walking to his car. Mortally wounded, <PERSON> Francke </PERSON> made it back to the Dome Building, the prison department headquarters, where he broke a glass pane in a door before collapsing. An hour later, late-working colleagues found <PERSON> Francke </PERSON>'s car, one door ajar, in the parking lot. But it was n't until five hours later that a security guard found <PERSON> Francke </PERSON>'s body. <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> has said <PERSON> Francke </PERSON> may have been killed while interrupting a car burglar. The death may also have been revenge for some aspect of <PERSON> Francke </PERSON>'s law enforcement work; he had been running the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> prisons for about two years after heading the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> prison system. The <PERSON> Francke </PERSON> brothers have rejected those scenarios from the beginning, and through interviews and daily contacts with sources have kept constant pressure on authorities to investigate the alleged conspiracy. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Francke </PERSON>, a printing press salesman who lives in <LOCATION> Lenexa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, said he thinks his brother was killed after he `` found some people in administrative positions within the system who were breaking the law.'' `` I think somewhere along the line, there was a confrontation,'' he said. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Francke </PERSON>, who owns a construction company in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said he firmly believes corrections officers or administrators were involved in his brother's death. His brother told him he had uncovered `` an organized criminal element'' and was going to make that information public, <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Francke </PERSON> said. But proving that theory will be difficult. `` It's a very well-run network,'' he said. `` It's like trying to put <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> out of business.'' <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> said his office will continue to study the conspiracy angle, `` but we still have not uncovered one witness or one piece of evidence that would establish or corroborate'' the theory, he said. <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> also expressed concern that <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION>'s columns on the subject would make potential witnesses reluctant to talk with investigators for fear of their identities becoming public. <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> rejected that criticism, saying <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> was the one who had created a climate of rumors by refusing to divulge details of the slaying. `` The case is of great interest to everyone in the state,'' <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> said. `` It's an extremely interesting mystery, and I would n't be doing my job if I did n't write about it.''

 Western European countries will send 10,000 tons of beef to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in the next few weeks as part of a $ 120 million aid package. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the executive arm of the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday the beef will be drawn from storage in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and sent to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> by Oct. 8. The commission said officials will decide soon the delivery dates for cereal shipments, including 200,000 tons of wheat stored in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, 75,000 tons of barley in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and 25,000 tons of barley in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. Another 200,000 tons of barley and 300,000 tons of wheat will be sent later. The supplies are part of a package of meat, olive oil, citrus fruits and cereals the agriculture ministers of the 12 <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> nations agreed last month to give <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, which has been hit hard by shortages. The <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> is sending the food free of charge on the condition the government sell it and use the money to improve the economy, especially the private farm sector. The Polish government has agreed to set up a `` counterpart fund,'' which is often used in development programs, to handle the money. The trading bloc and Polish officials will administer the fund jointly, according to a letter initialed by the two sides earlier this month. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and leaders of other rich democracies, holding their annual summit last month in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, asked the community to coordinate economic aid for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. They also urged emergency food shipments for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Western nations want to encourage the drive in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for more open political and market-oriented economic systems. Officials of two dozen Western nations met in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> on Aug. 1 to look at how they can help <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. At the meeting, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pledged to remove $ 50 million in food from its surplus stocks for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, on top of $ 9 million in food earmarked earlier. <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> also promised food aid. Polish President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> sent a letter last month to community officials asking for 685,000 tons of beef, pork, powdered milk, butter, oils, wheat, corn, rice and sugar in the next few months. He said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> would need at least 3.7 million tons of food next year and again in 1991. He also asked for 250,000 tons of feed for animals and at least $ 220 million worth of pesticides and similar products in 1990.

 The pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> today pledged to launch suicide attacks to foil what it called a campaign by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> against Moslems in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Police said one person was killed and nine wounded in clashes between Syrian and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> forces around the Christian enclave. `` The French naval buildup in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, the pope's fanatic and biased stands and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s moves at the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Security Council are part of the arrogant campaign aimed at taming the Moslems,'' <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, said in a statement published in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspapers The campaign, according to the statement, also aims at stripping Moslems of their rights and covering up <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s crimes in the territory it holds. `` This campaign will only lead to failure because the era of the Crusaders' invasion is gone following the spread of the spirit of martyrdom that forced the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- Marines and the French to retreat in 1983,'' the statement said. That was a reference to the suicide truck bomb attacks against the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> base and the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> paratroop headquarters in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> that killed 241 American servicemen and 58 French soldiers in October 1983. The bombings eventually led to the withdrawal from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> of a multinational peacekeeping force that also contained Italian and British contingents. Reports said the statement was released after a four-day meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> student council. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> recently dispatched the aircraft carrier <ORGANIZATION> Foch </ORGANIZATION> and the destroyer <ORGANIZATION> Duquesne </ORGANIZATION> to the eastern <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> to help evacuate an estimated 7,000 French nationals _ most duel citizens _ if necessary. <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> has no intention to intervene militarily, French Ambassador <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Ala </PERSON> told a news conference in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Friday. By police count, the 5-month-old confrontation between Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 20,000 predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> troops and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s 40,000 soldiers backed by allied Lebanese and Palestinian factions has killed 780 people and wounded 2,118 Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s closest ally in the confrontation, has rejected a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> call for a cease-fire in the confrontation with the 54-year-old <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. French government envoy <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Decaux </PERSON> ended a two-day mission in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> early today, leaving via military helicopter for <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, where he transferred to a jet bound for <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ala </PERSON> described <PERSON> Decaux </PERSON>'s visits, which included talks with <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and other Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> leaders, as `` successful.''

 The husband of the driver of a truck carrying warplane ammunition crawled to safety through an exploding barrage of shells after the truck crashed and exploded in the desert. The wreck 30 miles north of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> early Friday caused a 10-mile-long traffic backup on Interstate 17 while state police cordoned off the area to recover hundreds of live 20mm projectiles. Nearly 40,000 rounds of shells and bullets went up in the explosion and fire. The two northbound lanes of the freeway were restricted to one this morning while the cleanup continued, state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said. `` They're looking especially for those explosive projectiles that are undetonated,'' <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said. `` Then they're going to take three to four inches of soil as best they can around that truck and load it into some sort of vehicle and take that to some range where they can sift it out.'' The driver, <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Cullman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, was killed instantly in the crash of the truck carrying 17 tons of ammunition, he said. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, 36, was thrown from a sleeper compartment in the cab, which disintegrated in the blaze, <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said. `` One minute, he was asleep. The next minute, he was badly injured in the desert,'' <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>'s escape involved not only avoiding flames but the shells intended for use in F-15 and F-16 <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jets and other weapons, <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said. A passer-by picked up <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> and drove him to the <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> store, where they used a pay phone to notify authorities, <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> was taken to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> <PERSON> Hospital </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, where he was listed in serious condition with broken ribs and other injuries. Mrs. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>'s body was n't found for hours because of the danger of exploding shells, <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said. People were kept several hundred yards from the accident scene as a four-person Army explosives team recovered about 300 unexploded shells and similar amount of bullets which <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said were `` partially exploded'' and still dangerous. `` If the public thought of it as a hand grende, they might get a concept of what it's like when one of these -LRB- projectiles -RRB- goes off. It's basically that kind of explosion _ these are designed to fragment and blow off into a lot of little pieces, and they could take off a hand,'' <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said. The truck, hauling the ammunition from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huachuca </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vista </LOCATION> in southeast <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Flagstaff </LOCATION>, apparently was traveling through a storm when it veered left into a guardrail, <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> signed an affirmative action pact with a fast-food chain that had been accused of discriminating against black employees at one of its restaurants. The accord capped a four-day convention where the organization planned ways to preserve minority set-asides and battle recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions that threaten affirmative action. Under the agreement, the <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, Tenn.-based <ORGANIZATION> Shoney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will recruit and train blacks as managers and establish black-owned <PERSON> Shoney </PERSON>'s, Captain D's and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s Chicken franchises over the next three years.

The pact also called for the company to give contracts to black-owned public relations, insurance and construction firms. The agreement resulted from complaints by black employees at a Captain D's restaurant in <LOCATION> Anniston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, that working conditions were poor and that management discriminated against them, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Nettles </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Anniston </LOCATION> chapter.

In a speech to the convention on its opening day Tuesday, Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and civil rights leaders agree that civil rights gains must be preserved, but differed on how to do it. <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said the administration wants to limit minimum wage increases and disagrees with <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION>'s position on defense and social spending levels. `` All we're arguing about now is the dollar signs. They are in office; they have the resources,'' <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said. `` If they do n't put their money where their mouth is, then we've got a discrepancy.'' The <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION> intends to join other civil rights groups in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for an Aug. 26 march for affirmative action.

 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON> brought laughter to about 5,000 people attending a memorial service for his late colleague <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> with anecdotes about the congressman who died in a plane crash in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. `` In 1970 when I first won my first election, the shot heard around <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was, ` Afro child, bell-bottomed, racial black dude from <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> wins election,' `` <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON> said Friday night to the laughter of the crowd, including <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Alison </PERSON>. `` Eight years later, my colleagues walked up to me and said, ` Brother, you're not alone anymore. The 5th <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> sent an Afro child.''' `` When I saw a picture of him -LRB- <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> -RRB- with his afro bigger than mine, I said that's going to be my brother,'' <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> congressman described <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> as a compassionate man who strived to meet all his goals, foremost to end world hunger. The twin-engine plane carrying <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, 44, and 15 others crashed Aug. 7 on its way to a refugee camp near the Sudanese border. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, a six-term congressman and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Hunger, was leading an American-Ethiopian delegation concerned with feeding hundreds of thousands of Sudanese forced from their homes by civil war. Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Fields </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, said that despite their political differences, he and <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> were the best of friends. `` He'd tell people I was his basketball coach,'' Fields said. He also recalled how <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> once made a 3-point field goal, then stopped the game so he could call his wife to tell her of his first 3-pointer. Fields said <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> would rejoice at knowing that his death had brought national attention to world hunger. Other speakers included <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> and the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` Everything we're saying about <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> tonight was true a month ago and was n't being said,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. After a color guard procession opened the service, children carrying food filled six baskets in front of the podium. Seven pallbearers carried a simple pine casket _ a `` plain pine box'' that <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> requested in the event of his death. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s family is planning a private burial, pending the return of his remains from <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, probably some time next week, according to family friends.

<HEAD>Japan to Conduct Survey on Acid Rain</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will conduct a study next year to determine the effects of acid rain on its forests, which cover 70 percent of the land. The study, the most comprehensive of its kind in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, will also recommend ways to improve the condition of the forests, <PERSON> Yutaka </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawanaka </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement today. Acid rain results from the mixture of rain and sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and other pollutants that enter the atmosphere mainly as emissions from factories and electric power plants. The study will begin April 1, 1990 and take samples from 1,200 locations within the nation's forests, <PERSON> Kawanaka </PERSON> said. Until recently, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> paid little attention to acid rain and the damage it has caused. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> have been studying the problem for some time, although critics say they have taken few steps to stop acid rain. `` Damage caused by acid rain has been negligible in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> because we have rich, thick soil that is hard to acidify, whereas soil in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is thin and easily acidified,'' <PERSON> Kawanaka </PERSON> said. `` Also, coniferous or evergreen trees, including the fir prevalent in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, are more easily damaged than the broad-leaved deciduous forests we have in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.'' However, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> recently reported the results of a five-year survey that concluded that acid rain has been falling all over <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. It did not specify whether damage has been done.

 President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> announced his Cabinet nominees to parliament today and left out one of his rivals, a hard-line interior minister, against the request of more than half the lawmakers. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON> with <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Nouri </PERSON>, a leading figure in the Revolutionary Guards, a branch of the military, the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. Earlier today, the government-supervised <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> had reported that <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> would not include his hard-line opponents in the Cabinet. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said more than half the nominees were new faces and news reports indicated the list could cause a political brawl in parliament. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> had been expected to present his Cabinet to the Majlis, or parliament, on Sunday. The Majlis was scheduled to review and approve new procedures for appointing ministers today, and it apparently finished its work early enough for <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> to give the lawmakers his list. The 270-member parliament must confirm each nominee. Former Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> and Minister of Intelligence <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyshahri </PERSON>, two other major figures in the faction opposed to <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, would also be eliminated from the new government, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted the <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> as saying. <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>'s post of prime minister was scrapped under constitutional changes that concentrate executive power in the presidency. The paper said unidentified sources provided the details for its story. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said that 138 deputies signed a letter, read in the <ORGANIZATION> Majlis </ORGANIZATION> earlier today, asking <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> to keep <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON> as interior minister. The report indicated that the deputies acknowledged the competition between the two men, saying: `` The presence of powerful personalities in the future Cabinet is inevitable.'' But it urged him to appoint <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON>, noting the `` sensitivity of the arrogant world'' _ the usual reference to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ to the issue. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> acknowledged during his inauguration speech Thursday that a fight was brewing over his appointments, with some ministers refusing to serve in his government. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> did not indicate in its report whether <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s rivals were being dumped or had declined to work with him. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> is viewed a pragmatist, seeking more private investment and links with the West to obtain the technology and financing to rebuild an economy shattered by eight years of war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. His hard-line rivals support a centralized economy and believe that confrontation with the West better serves the Islamic revolution. The shape of <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s government, and especially the competition with the hard-line faction, will determine how fast <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> moves on a number of foreign policy issues, such as signing a peace treaty with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and pressuring pro-Iranian groups in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to release the Western hostages they hold.

 Defense Minister <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiwei </PERSON>, whom <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> sources have reported is engaged in a power struggle for control of the army, appeared on national television today at the funeral of a revolutionary veteran. <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> was shown in a news report on the funeral of <PERSON> Fu </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhong </PERSON>, a legislator and former colonel-general, along with other top Chinese leaders. The report did not identify him by name, although it identified the other leaders. Chinese sources say <PERSON> Qin </PERSON>, 75, is engaged in a struggle with President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON> for control of the army and the nation after the death of senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, who is believed to be very ill. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> turns 85 Tuesday The sources said Thursday that troops commanded by <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> led <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> away from his <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> residence on Wednesday evening after <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> argued with <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> over which of them should be promoted to first vice chairman of the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The post was held by former party General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> until he was stripped of all his jobs in June. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> is commission chairman, and first vice chairman is the second only to <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> currently is permanent vice chairman and secretary general of the commission. Several Chinese sources in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> said that after being led away <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> was placed under house arrest, but the television appearance seemed to rule that out. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> denied to foreign reporters Friday that <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> was arrested or deposed as defense minister but did not specificly deny he was detained by troops on <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>'s orders. Telephone calls to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> were not answered today. One source, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> held a meeting Friday night of top military commanders to discuss his appointment as first vice chairman, but that the commanders did not express support. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> asked them to stay in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> until a decision can be reached. The source said <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s health is deteriorating rapidly. Military commanders who visited him this week found he was so infirm that he could not speak, the source said. He said his information came from the wife of one commander and secretary of another. A Western diplomat said the reported struggle between <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> is over more than just the military commission's vice chairmanship. `` The general consensus here is that it's the top post, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s position, that is at stake,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> was ousted after losing a power struggle with conservatives who accused him of supporting student pro-democracy protests this spring. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> helped lead the army crackdown on the protesters June 3-4, but <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> was believed to oppose it. The Western diplomat said regional military commanders were opposing <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>'s attempts to elevate himself because of his extensive family connections in the military. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>'s is one of the strongest military families in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> today praised plans for a Solidarity-led government in his native <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and indicated he might travel to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> soon on a mission of peace. The pontiff, traveling to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> for the third time, said he had not yet received a response from Lebanese authorities to his recent statement that he would like to visit the war-ravaged Middle Eastern country. However, he told reporters traveling on his plane: `` We can say a certain interest has been shown.'' He refused to elaborate, but his spokesman, <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON>, said the interest had come from various foreign ministries, which he did not identify. The pope has expressed outrage at the recent fighting in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> between Christian and Syrian-led forces, and last week said he felt an `` imperative'' to visit the country. More than 750 people have been killed since the latest round of battles in the nation's 14-year-old civil war broke out in March Asked whether he was satisfied with developments in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, where a non-communist-led government was expected to take power, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> grinned broadly and said, `` more or less.'' `` All that has been done is very important, a step forward,'' he said. `` It's not easy,'' he added. The pope is an old friend of <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, a Solidarity journalist reported Friday to be Communist President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s choice for prime minister. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s outspoken support of Solidarity is credited with keeping the independent labor movement alive during the seven years it was outlawed. The pontiff last met with <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> on his third trip to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in 1987, <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said. The focus of the trip was the fourth Vatican-sponsored World Youth Day today, which has drawn 300,000 young people from 55 countries to this city, one of the three most important pilgrimage sites in the history of the church. The 69-year-old pontiff donned a traditional brown pilgrim's mantle over his white robes and walked the final 100 yards of the 500-mile Way of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> to show his symbolic participation in the trek from the Pyrenees to <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> Once there, he spoke briefly to thousands of cheering youths and embraced a statue of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> in the cathedral in accordance with another pilgrim custom. Millions of pilgrims have traveled to the northwestern Spanish city in the 11 centuries since the bones of the martyred apostle St. <PERSON> James </PERSON> were reportedly found there. The pope is using the symbol of the <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> pilgrimage to urge young people to spread their faith to places where it does n't exist, and to revive it in <LOCATION> First </LOCATION> <LOCATION> World </LOCATION> countries where religious practice has declined. `` The church of today is preparing itself for a new Christianization, which is presented to you as a challenge,'' he said in a speech at <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>'s airport, where he was greeted by Spanish King <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON>. Of particular concern to the church as it approaches its 2,000 th birthday is the dramatic slide in the practice of religion in traditionally Roman Catholic European countries Both in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> has condemned what he considers First World ills: consumerism and `` secular'' attitudes promoting premarital sex and divorce. This weekend's celebrations include a papal address to a youth rally at a mountain outside <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> today, and a Mass on Sunday. About 160 bishops are attending the celebrations, which were preceded by a week of cultural and religious meetings for youth leaders. The events have drawn young people from countries including communist-ruled <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and Soviet <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>. Most are being housed in tents, turning the city of 85,000 and its environs into a giant campground. Many of those participating in the Youth Day followed part of the old pilgrimage route this week. Police said Friday that a French priest had died of a heart attack while cycling along the route to <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> for the papal visit. After his visit to <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, the pope is to address Catholics in the northern cities of <LOCATION> Oviedo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Covadonga </LOCATION>. The pope may speak about the shift away from church practice in the 11 years since Catholicism was dropped as the state religion, which it was under dictator <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> now has a limited abortion law and another giving the state effective control over subsidies to and curricula of religious schools. Both took effect in 1985, following visits by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> in 1982 and 1984. A security force of about 5,000 Civil Guards and police are on hand for the pontiff's visit.

Now Iowans are betting these waters will deliver them another precious commodity _ greenbacks. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, known more for hogs than high rollers, is moving to revive riverboat gambling, hoping the romance of the past will generate riches for the future _ and it's not alone. Across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s heartland, several states are planning or considering gambling ventures to try to bring dollars, jobs and tourists into struggling industrial cities and small towns hit hard this decade by factory closings, the farm depression and the exodus of jobs and people. `` If we were still doing well and had not turned into the great Rust Belt, you would not see this great influx of gambling in the guise of economic development,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, a key supporter of riverboat gambling in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. `` It's a nice stopgap until we can readjust ourselves and get back on two solid feet.'' Soon there will be wagers in the land of Wild <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickok </PERSON>, the gold rush town of Deadwood, S.D. There's gambling talk, too, in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. That's not to suggest there are n't skeptics and critics. Some argue the stakes are too low to be an economic salvation, the sites too ho-hum or bleak for tourism. Others fear games of chance will erode the American Gothic ethic. `` When gambling comes in, all of the other social crimes increase,'' said <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Primavera </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gambling </ORGANIZATION>. `` It increases loan sharking. It increases drug traffic ... -LRB- and -RRB- prostitution.'' Supporters insist they intend to create family entertainment. `` Those traditional <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> heartland values are ... still going to be there,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Davenport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. The only change, proponents say, is the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> will being doing more to strut its stuff. `` The <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> is well known worldwide,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. `` -LRB- It's -RRB- a gold mine in our backyard and we have n't taken advantage of it.'' `` It's all right to be homespun,'' <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said. `` That's part of the charm of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. But it may be time we get a little more sophisticated.'' And gambling seems a logical step with the increasing popularity of bingo, lotteries and horse and dog tracks. In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, for example, a record $ 205 million was wagered on games of chance last year, including pull tabs, blackjack and bingo. More than 30 states have lotteries and more than 40 have parimutuel betting, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nevada-Las </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vegas </ORGANIZATION> management and public administration professor and co-author of a book on casinos. There's more to come: _ In <LOCATION> Deadwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, there will be poker, blackjack and slot machines, probably in October. Voters this spring approved gambling. City proceeds will go to historic preservation in this once rip-roaring <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> town where <PERSON> Hickok </PERSON>'s last poker game ended with a bullet in his head. `` What we're really doing is returning to our past and saying that's really our future,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, co-owner of a local hotel. _ In <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, a struggling steel capital on <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, voters will be asked in a non-binding November referendum whether they want resort hotels with casino gambling. Supporters of casino gambling in <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, say they are not giving up despite failing to get enough signatures to put the issue on the November ballot. In 1988, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> rejected casinos for the third time in 12 years. _ In <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, some lawmakers want to mimic <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and put riverboats and other floating casinos on parts of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and other waterways. The <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in June rejected such a plan but a task force has since been formed to study the issue so lawmakers can reconsider it in the fall. Many Illinois officials are eager to put paddlewheelers in the water before <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, which does n't start riverboat gambling until April 1991. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> requires county referendums before gambling can begin in each local area. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> has proposed creating a regional agency to monitor riverboat gambling on the states' boundary waters. The lure of big tourist bucks is particularly appealing to <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> towns in both states, which have lost thousands of manufacturing jobs in the last decade. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> has estimated gambling on its rivers and lakes could generate $ 1.7 billion in spinoffs from tourism and new business. There's concern, though, riverboats could cut into the bingo and racing profits. Further, <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> said, `` At some point, you reach a saturation point. If <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> has it, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> ... the impact of it for any individual state is going to be diluted.'' Some experts say <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s riverboat project already is in trouble because of a $ 5 limit per bet, $ 200 cap on nightly losses and 20 percent casino revenue tax that will make it harder to reap a profit. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> `` has produced an unworkable bill that will probably result in naught,'' <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, senior analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said in a report. He added in a telephone interview: `` They're going to throw a party no one will go to.'' Especially, some say, if it's far away. `` People from around the country are not going to travel to <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> to spend $ 5 on riverboat gambling,'' said Professor <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. `` Everything that is good about it lends itself to being small ... -LRB- But -RRB- if it's small it's not going to add much to the economy.'' But local folks insist they're not expecting miracles. `` I do n't think anybody has touted riverboat gambling as the answer to their economic woes,'' <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON> said. `` It's like chicken soup. It ca n't hurt and it looks like it could help. ... It's just another piece of ammunition to lure people.'' That's also what Deadwood hopes to do. `` There's no other way we could think of to raise money,'' said <PERSON> Melodee </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, head of the Deadwood You Bet Committee. `` Deadwood is sitting 45 miles from a major airport, 15 miles from the interstate. No industry is going to come to Deadwood.'' But big cities that have industry and are looking for gambling to reverse their fortunes also face obstacles, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dombrink </PERSON>, associate social ecology professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California-Irvine </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s co-author. `` It's kind of Pollyannish to think a blue-collar industrial city is somehow tailor-made for ... a tourist industry,'' he said. `` ` Tourism is not like a nose job, where one day you can wave a wand. ... It might take a long time for people's perceptions to change.'' But some in <LOCATION> Gary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, believe the scenic lakefront and proximity to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> will make the city an ideal casino site, despite its problems with shuttered stores, a bleak downtown and a shrinking workforce. `` I think it's <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>'s last shot at an economic development project that will deliver in the magnitude the steel mills once delivered on,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> Earline </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, a supporter. `` Nothing else we've looked at will revitalize <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> in the same manner. If casino gambling ca n't do it, nothing can.''

 Only a few countries in the Communist world have benefited from <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform movement. The norm still is old-fashioned Stalinist doctrine and lack of economic and political freedom. Here is a report by an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> correspondent who has reported widely on developments in the Communist bloc.

<TEXT>
 Despite momentous reforms in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, the march toward democracy and personal freedom has made little, if any progress elsewhere in the vast Communist world in the four years since President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took power in the Kremlin. The Soviet reforms, however, and the increasingly obvious failures of state-controlled economies to match Western technology and consumer plenty have encouraged people under <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rule to demand change. The responses of their governments range from tinkering with the economy while leaving political reform alone to outright repression. Huge security networks still are deployed to crush or at least curb free speech as aging leaders from <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> cling to power. The most vivid display of old-style Communist determination to stay in power at any cost has come in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Before the eyes of a world, hundreds, perhaps thousands, of pro-democracy demonstrators were felled by military tanks and gunfire early in June. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, more people have been arrested and dozens executed since. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> are other examples where little has changed since <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> emerged on the world scene. In fact, conditions may actually have deteriorated. `` While in other Socialist countries, they are taking steps toward a more open society, in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> it's going exactly backwards,'' said <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Tscherne </PERSON>, who monitors human rights for the Vienna-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>. Food in shops is scarcer and rationing of bread and other staples more widespread the longer <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> presides over the land once known as the breadbasket of southeastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Senior Communists and well-known writers demanding change face house arrest, jail or mental hospitals; less prominent dissenters disappear without a trace. In <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, harangues Soviet-style reform as a return to capitalism. In an unexplained move attributed by some analysts to internal power struggles, the nation's top general was recently executed after being convicted of drug trafficking; three dissidents face up to four years in jail after reportedly telling foreigners that confessions at the trial were extracted by torture. In rigid <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, desperation over the lack of political and economic reform is driving hundreds of thousands to apply to emigrate West. Thousands more who ca n't stand the years of waiting for legal permission to go are escaping in the biggest human flow westward since the Communists built the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall in 1961. `` We're just second-class citizens here, or worse,'' one East German told Western reporters. `` My parents said, ` go, we'd go too if we were younger,''' said an <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> woman in her early 20s, one of hundreds fleeing across <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s newly porous border with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. Pointing to other youths who did the same, she added, `` We all work in professions where you actually make money in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. But there's nothing to spend it on.'' Other Communist governments that have rejected genuine reforms vacillate between concessions and repression. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, whose Communists traditionally have paid much heed to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, have lent strong verbal support to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s perestroika, or restructuring, and claimed to be implementing their own versions. In both countries, however, reform seems skin-deep, limited to some new freedom in the state-controlled arts and changes billed as improvements in running stagnating state economies. `` Certain surface, let's say, official improvements have been made,'' said <PERSON> Jana </PERSON> <PERSON> Starek </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>. `` Unfortunately, nothing has changed as far as strictly political cases, cases of religious belief and independent civil organizations are concerned.'' In <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, which has perhaps the strongest democratic traditions of any Soviet bloc nation, sporadic anti-government protests and petitions for reform have yielded nothing but more harassment and jail for dissidents and their supporters. In <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, organized dissident groups have emerged for virtually the first time under Communist rule. But activists have quickly found the limits of glasnost, Bulgarian-style, suffering police harassment, imprisonment or forced emigration. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s ethnic Turks are fleeing by the hundreds of thousands to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> after at least nine people died in May protests against an assimilation campaign and authorities began deporting dozens of ethnic <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> activists. In <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, still freer in spirit than the Soviet bloc with which it broke in 1948, ethnic tension is also mounting, fueled by economic chaos resulting from a decentralized political system and state mismanagement of agriculture and industry. Hundreds of ethnic Albanians have been jailed since they protested last spring against constitutional changes they say curbed their autonomy in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. While <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s Communist nations are embroiled in upheaval, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, a nation ravaged by turmoil for decades, seems calmly to be implementing its version of perestroika, known as `` doi moi.'' According to a recent report in the authoritative British weekly The Economist, `` doi moi'' has not halted the flow of boat people risking their lives to escape Communist <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. But it has raised economic production _ and hopes _ without yet firing political unrest. In <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, steeped in traditions of individual liberty, the lifting of the rigid clamp of totalitarianism seems fraught with more danger. The restructuring of a vast, diverse country such as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> seems unable to proceed without the upheaval seen in the Baltic republics, the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> and in Siberian and Ukrainian miners' strikes Fear of such turbulence bolsters <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> governments that have so far rejected change. In <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, for example, living standards are still relatively high and workers living for four decades by the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc motto `` we pretend to work, and they pretend to pay us'' are afraid reform will send artificially low prices soaring and put them out of their cozy jobs. Popular pressure for change could mount if <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> proves that smaller, more developed and more ethnically homogenous nations than the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> can achieve democratic reform without major upheaval. Younger Communists also may prove more willing to countenance change than the older leaders in power now: <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, 76; <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>, 75; <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>, 77; <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, 71; and <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, younger at 62 but at the top since 1959. When it does come, however, change may not be as sudden as it has been in the past breathtaking months in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Interim Communist leaders may preside over a period of more gradual reform before relinquishing or sharing power, argues one Western analyst speaking on condition of anonymity. `` It's not like a trigger that will suddenly produce Poszgays -LRB- <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Poszgay </PERSON> is <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s most reform-minded Communist -RRB- or Gorbachevs in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' he added. `` Precisely because they have held out for such a long time and their people see that change can be painful, these nations might need another tinkering period before they start on their own.''

 The government on Saturday began releasing more than 1,000 prisoners who had been held without charge since 1986 on suspicion of supporting rebel groups. The minister for internal affairs, <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mukiibi </PERSON>, announced the release Friday. He said the 1,086 political detainees would be transported to their home areas. The prisoners were captured during fighting between government troops and the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Uganda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. They are the third group of prisoners to be released since the rebels signed a peace accord with the government in June 1988. On June 20, 1988, 1,671 prisoners were released, and in October 950 more were freed. The latest release would leave an estimated 1,730 political prisoners still in <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>'s prisons. Human rights groups have singled out the government of President <PERSON> Yoweri </PERSON> <PERSON> Museveni </PERSON> for holding the detainees without charge or trial.

 It was Nov. 10, 1938 in <LOCATION> Wittenberg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and 11-year-old <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> sat in his aunt's apartment among the broken glass, china and furniture left behind the night before by a rampaging Nazi mob. Only one friend dared visit the apartment to warn <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> it was too dangerous to return to a school where he was the only Jewish student. The schoolmate, <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindemann </PERSON>, had parents who did n't like <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and he was the only gentile at the school who refused to wear the uniform of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s youth organization That November and the months that followed summon painful memories for the 62-year-old <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON>, but one pleasant recollection has unexpectedly returned. After 50 years, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> and <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindemann </PERSON> have found each other. <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON>, now a patent attorney in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Lindemann </PERSON>, a retired physician living near <LOCATION> Wittenberg </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, correspond regularly, and <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> is considering a personal visit. Playing the central role in their reunion was last fall's 50th anniversary of `` Kristallnacht'' _ the night of the broken glass _ when Jewish homes, businesses and synagogues were destroyed in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> agreed last November to relive his experience in a special service at his synagogue, <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinai </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. While preparing for the event, <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> opened his mailbox one day to find a letter from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The note from <PERSON> Lindemann </PERSON> was short. The East German said he felt compelled to write because of the anniversary. <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> still is n't sure how <PERSON> Lindemann </PERSON> found his address `` His next letter was very lengthy,'' <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> said. `` He told me everything since school. To me, it meant a lot. I have a great need to feel connected to my past.'' `` Dear <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Lindemann </PERSON> wrote last January. `` Those were stormy times. I'm happy you still speak of <PERSON> Wittenberg </PERSON> as your home. Many Germans fall silent when they think about the persecution of the Jews. ... I have felt that since childhood the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> were evil, but my eyes were not opened until 1945. Until then, I knew nothing of the concentration camps, nothing of the killing which took place daily ... `` You had such a difficult childhood. Unimaginable.'' Last month, <PERSON> Lindemann </PERSON> pleaded: `` Please come as soon as possible. It would make me so happy.'' The letters sent <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON>'s thoughts rolling back in time, and he recalled that his friend's visit after Crystal Night was n't the only time <PERSON> Lindemann </PERSON> risked his safety for his Jewish friend. `` <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> and I would occasionally meet in the park after dark, where he would tell me about school. It was dangerous for him, but it meant a lot to me. He was my one connection to the community. Otherwise, we were outcasts,'' <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> said he wants to visit his hometown, the site of the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformation </ORGANIZATION>, where only a dozen Jewish families lived when <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON>'s family owned a shoe factory there. But <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> admitted, `` I do n't know if I could handle it.'' `` I've had a lot of therapy, which is why I have a fairly normal life. I had to do a lot of work to deal with the leftovers of my childhood. When you go to survivors' groups, you see a lot of sad faces.'' <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> has traveled to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on legal business but never tried to cross the border into <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` I felt my past was lost. When people said, ` Why do n't you go back,' my answer would be, ` I do n't know anybody there anymore. They would all be strangers,''' he said. <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> by boat in February 1939, one of the lucky children allowed to go without his parents on a special `` Kindertransport'' to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. His mother _ and his father, who was sent to a concentration camp for several months _ made their way to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> later, before the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> closed the gates to Jewish emigration. In his letters, <PERSON> Lindemann </PERSON> went into great detail on his own life: drafted at 15 into the <ORGANIZATION> Germany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, six months in a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> prisoner of war camp, a stint as a teacher, a career as a government doctor, a kidney illness that has left him with a decent government pension. <PERSON> Lindemann </PERSON> has found another link to <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON>'s past: <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Senst </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON>'s best childhood friend before he went along with peer pressure and joined the <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> youth group. `` <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> is now working for the <ORGANIZATION> Wittenberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> into Persecution of the Jews,'' <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> said, relaying information from <PERSON> Lindemann </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> said he did n't give him my address because he did n't know if it was okay with me. I will write him back and say I want to get in touch.''

 Talk about disposable income. On Saturday, sanitation workers found yet another bundle of money in the garbage, the latest in a rash of trashed cash.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, a crowded country with no tradition of welcoming immigrants, has since the early 1980s granted safe harbor to all Vietnamese boat people. But now it finds itself overwhelmed. `` We are considering whether we should change our policy and introduce screening,'' said <PERSON> Toshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsunozaki </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s human rights and refugee division. `` But of course the biggest problem that arises from screening is what to do with the screened-out.'' Unlike other countries, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has no screening process to distinguish between those fleeing <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> for political reasons and those who simply want a chance for economic security. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> says it will not accept those forced to return home. The boat people, turned away from the shores of their already inundated Southeast Asian neighbors, have begun to navigate a perilous route 1,900 miles across the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> to southern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. But with 1,422 refugees so far this year, compared to 219 during all of 1988, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> says it can no longer handle the flow. The country's only refugee reception center, at <LOCATION> Omura </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION> prefecture, already was at double its capacity with 415 refugees when 137 more arrived in the nearby <LOCATION> Goto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> on Monday. `` It is impossible to receive any more,'' said <PERSON> Hisao </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishino </PERSON>, deputy director of the Omura Refugee Reception Center. `` It's just too much, and the government should do something about it right now,'' he said. In the latest arrival, a <ORGANIZATION> coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> guard </ORGANIZATION> ship carrying 188 boat people was to arrive in <LOCATION> Naha </LOCATION> on the southern Japanese island of <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> on Sunday morning, officials said. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, flooded with about 52,000 Indochinese refugees, is trying to persuade economic refugees to return home. About 150 have gone voluntarily, and the British colony is considering forcible repatriation if the bottleneck continues. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is affluent, but unlike immigrant nations such as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, it is very crowded and not accustomed to accepting immigrants. `` The Indochinese are the first people to be accepted systematically into <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Chikako </PERSON> <PERSON> Saito </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has geographical limitations, but as a member of the international community, it realizes it must share the burden.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency estimates 2 million people have fled <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> since 1975. Most of the recent arrivals here braved bands of pirates who are believed to have killed several hundred boat people in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> this year. <PERSON> Pho </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Son </PERSON>, 34, the leader of a group of 151 who left northern <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on a 60-ton boat, said he decided to aim for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> after he heard on short-wave radio that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> accepts refugees. The 20-day journey, calling at Chinese ports for food and anchoring at small islands for shelter from stormy weather, was difficult, he said. Also difficult, he said, was the discrimination at home because of his Chinese blood. `` Now,'' Son said after two days at <PERSON> Omura </PERSON>, `` all the difficulty has passed.'' He and his companions want to resettle in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. A poor farmer from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gai </LOCATION>, Son says he does n't know what he will do here but expects the Japanese will find jobs for him and his family. `` Most of the refugees arriving here now do n't know much about <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Saito </PERSON>. `` They were headed anywhere. They just wanted to get out of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.'' At the camp, the refugees wear clean T-shirts, shorts and sandals and look surprisingly healthy. They take Japanese and English classes, eat Japanese food and write letters to relatives, some of whom fled <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> ahead of them and have settled in such places as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. Their 9-by-12-foot rooms, with floors covered in tatami mats, are crowded with up to six people. Laundry is strung across the rooms and graffitti is scrawled on many of the walls. Above a framed picture of the American oil tanker that rescued them in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Loi </PERSON> <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hong </PERSON>, 44, and his son, <PERSON> Chau </PERSON> <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hong </PERSON>, 18, have written `` This American ship saved us from death.'' On another wall is written `` liberty.'' Nearby, the word `` communism'' is crossed out with red paint. Hong displayed a photo album with pictures of his brother, a Vietnamese translator, and sister-in-law who live in <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Hong hopes his brother can sponsor him and his son to resettle in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hong </PERSON>'s friend, <PERSON> Hung </PERSON> <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON>, 32, planned to present a petition to the staff asking for the refugees from southern <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to be segregated from the northern people. `` We risked our lives to escape communism and to get here, and we do n't want to live in the same place as them,'' said <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON>, who used to teach English in <LOCATION> Ho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> bears no ill will toward the northern Vietnamese, but thinks he must make clear he is a political refugee to win resettlement in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where already about 800,000 Indochinese refugees have settled. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has resettled 6,257 Vietnamese since the early 1980s. In June it pledged to accept 1,000 more over the next three years, but that plan would be already out of date if most of the 1,400-plus who have arrived this year were to remain in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. In 1986 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> said it was willing to take a total of 10,000 refugees from <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> today nominated Solidarity activist <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> as prime minister in a move that will end the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s 45-year grip on government power. `` The president thinks that the formation of such a government will be conducive to expeditiously overcoming economic difficulties ... and satisfying the needs and aspirations of Polish society,'' the official news agency said. Moments earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency announced that <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> had accepted the resignation of communist Prime Minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, who was unable to form a government in the face of opposition from the Solidarity labor movement. <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> would soon forward the nomination of <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, a former political prisoner with close ties to Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, to the speaker of the Sejm, the lower house of parliament. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, 62, said Friday he was prepared to accept the premiership. He was reported by an associate to be resting today outside of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> must now elect <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>. A parliamentary majority put together by Solidarity and two minor parties _ the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ assures <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s election. Even with a non-communist coalition in charge of the government, the Communists will continue to wield great influence. As president, <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> oversees military and foreign policy. Party members fill the government and courts. Solidarity, mindful of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s strategic concerns, has said it will let the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> retain control of the ministries of defense and interior, which oversee the army and police. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> was described by <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> as a `` longtime <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> activist and former <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> deputy,'' one of the leading activists of Solidarity and the editor of its weekly newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> Tygodnik </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarnosc </ORGANIZATION>. `` In the present situation, the president sees a need to create a government enjoying the necessary support of parliamentary floor groups and to build it on foundations of broad agreement between <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s political and social forces,'' <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said. The announcement came as the communist <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was meeting in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was meeting with union leadership in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. A presidential spokesman said there was `` some division'' within the committee concerning the historic change but that members were expected to back the plan. The policy-making body's approval appeared necessary for the changes to work because the party controls the powerful bureaucracies that run <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, traveling in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, today praised the recent developments, calling them `` very important, a step forward.'' The Polish-born <PERSON> pope </PERSON> is an old friend of <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>. On Friday, the powerful <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> argued for a non-political `` government of experts'' _ an apparent last-minute bid to keep the government from falling under Solidarity's control. White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Friday that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would have no comment on the selection of a new prime minister until the parliamentary process is completed. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was not considering expanding the $ 119 million economic aid package he has announced for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> opened a meeting today at Solidarity national headquarters in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, where some union members were wary about the communist's reaction to the expected government changeover `` The PZPR -LRB- party -RRB- of course will defend itself. It will begin to start provocations. For the party, the greater disorder that there is, the better, because we are appealing for calm,'' said <PERSON> Alojzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pietrzyk </PERSON>, a Solidarity official from the southern coal fields of <PERSON> Jastrzebie </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s nomination caps a dramatic comeback for the veteran activist, who spent a year in jail during <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s martial law crackdown of 1981. As prime minister, he would lead a country with an economy crippled by a $ 39 billion foreign debt, food shortages and widespread public discontent. He would be given several weeks to assemble a Cabinet and present it to the Sejm for a vote. A Solidarity-led government would be of historic significance because it would be the first government in the Soviet bloc not under the control of the communists since Soviet dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> consolidated control of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in the late 1940s. The Soviet government daily <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it is clear that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is headed for its first non-communist government in decades. Perhaps to reassure Soviets there would be some continuity, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> also ran excerpts from an interview <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> gave to West German TV in which he said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> would remain in the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> military alliance. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> journalist trained as a lawyer, was at <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s side when nationwide strikes last year served as the catalyst for the government's decision to open talks with the union, legalize it and allow opposition participation in lections. Those elections resulted in Solidarity's victory in virtually every race its candidates entered. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> was editor of a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> monthly from 1958 until 1981 when he founded <ORGANIZATION> Tygodnik </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarnosc </ORGANIZATION>. It was banned under martial law but resurrected this year after Solidarity was legalized.

<HEAD>Activities of Bloch's Wife Under Scrutiny By Federal Investigators</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal investigators are studying the activities and finances of <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> in search of evidence that could be used in the case being developed against her husband, spy suspect <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, sources say. Mrs. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> has taken a leave of absence from her job as executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Austrian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a group dedicated to improving U.S.-Austrian relations. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> was the No. 2 diplomat at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> from 1980 to 1986. Sources familiar with the case say Mrs. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> is not suspected of any wrongdoing or of being an accomplice. But in the hunt for any motive or evidence of espionage by <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, investigators are looking for signs of unexplained wealth or unusual trips which often accompany spy cases, said the sources, who spoke on condition they not be identified. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, 54, has not been charged with any crime, but was placed on paid leave by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in June. About two weeks ago, Mrs. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> asked the foundation, which receives money from the Austrian foreign ministry, for a leave of absence for an indefinite period, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> attorney who serves as the group's secretary. Mrs. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> made the decision on her own, and was not prodded by officials of the tax-deductible foundation, he said. Several of Mrs. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>'s friends described her as distraught over the investigation of her husband. While <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> has remained at the couple's apartment in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> has stayed with relatives in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, according to her friends. Her office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a room she rents from another consultant, is staffed by a secretary. Mrs. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> could not be reached for comment. She told a newspaper in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> last month, `` We are all very affected and in these difficult times we stand behind him.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> said was a spectacular and `` very hard-working'' employee, was hired as the foundation's executive director in 1988, according to forms on file with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> secretary of state's office in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>. She was paid $ 24,375 last year The foundation was set up in 1984 `` to promote, develop and support cultural, scientific, scholarly and intellectual relations'' between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, its brochure says. A host of famous people are associated with the group including director <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, a trustee; former Secretary of State <PERSON> Cyrus </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>, honorary trustees, and conductor <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, an advisory council member. Although <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> said the foundation has no official relationship with the Austrian government, records show the group received a $ 39,370 grant from the Austrian Foreign Ministry in 1988. The Austrian foreign minister, <PERSON> Alois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mock </PERSON>, is a good friend of the <ORGANIZATION> Blochs </ORGANIZATION>' from their graduate school days in the 1950s. They met at <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bologna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Last June, Mrs. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> stayed at Mock's home in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and attended a dinner party there, a guest told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. And last year, Mrs. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>'s foundation hosted a $ 1,653 luncheon for Mock, records show. Altogether in 1988, the foundation collected $ 167,414, of which $ 120,982 came from corporate and other business grants. <PERSON> Philipp </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyos </PERSON>, a political minister at the <ORGANIZATION> Austrian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, said his country channelled some `` seed money'' to the foundation when it was established. Since then, the government has helped the foundation with its projects, he said. Despite the foundation's good intentions, <PERSON> Hoyos </PERSON> said, the group has not had as much success in fund-raising as some thought initially. <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> said he hoped the foundation would not be unfairly tarnished by the <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> affair, but acknowledged the group might be put in a `` defensive posture'' because of the publicity.

<TEXT>
 A farm town that consists of two bars, a grain elevator, a church, baseball field and 70 people can now boast it's the smallest place <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Cash </PERSON> ever played. Cash took the stage in the alfalfa field behind the County Line Bar on Friday night before nearly 5,000 people, just about all of them from out of town. `` Twenty years ago, they had <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>. Welcome to Cornstalk,'' the singer kwown for such hits as `` I Walk the Line'' and `` A Boy Named Sue'' told the mass of fans, many sitting in lawn chairs and sporting caps emblazoned with feed company logos. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Kampsen </PERSON>, 33, organized the concert in part to please his father, <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>, a longtime Cash fan who sings with a local band called Country Cruisin'. The elder <PERSON> Kampsen </PERSON>, a 65-year-old farmer, got to sing a couple of songs with the Man in Black. `` I've liked him since, it seems like when I was a kid,'' <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Kampsen </PERSON> said. `` I guess I like him because he was a poor man at one time. He sings songs about poor people. Like us.'' Cash's wife, June Carter Cash, opened the show at 8 p.m., and Cash took the stage an hour later. Daughter <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cash </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> sisters <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> also performed. Cash, a severe cold draining his voice, struggled through versions of `` Folsom Prison Blues,'' `` Ring of Fire,'' `` Orange Blossom Special'' and other old favorites, plus a series of gospel songs during his 75-minute performance. `` I've been getting fan mail from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> from people asking ` Where's Regal? We ca n't find it on the map,''' Cash said. And he said he and his family had been looking forward to the Regal show more than any other concert date on this year's schedule. Cash's manager, <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Robin </PERSON>, confirmed that <PERSON> Regal </PERSON>, about 100 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, was the smallest town the singer ever played. `` It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Beirer </PERSON> of Regal. <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> of <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON> said she brought her husband, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, who had never been to a concert before. She called Cash `` the most human of all the country-western singers.'' <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Kampsen </PERSON> said earlier he needed to sell 3,500 tickets at $ 20 to $ 30 each to break even on the show. <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffenkamp </PERSON>, who handled concert publicity, said 4,800 tickets were sold. <PERSON> Kampsen </PERSON> borrowed money from a bank to make the up-front payment to Cash, but would n't say how much he paid the singer. `` The banker thought I was kind of nuts, but he gave me the money anyway,'' he said. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and about 40 others came from <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, on a bus provided by a local radio station. `` We're just a bunch of country hicks who like <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Cash </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` About a week ago, we heard about it and said ` Gee, we ought to go, we're done with harvest.' But we did n't know where it was. We had a 1970 atlas and we could n't find Regal.''

 <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> created the celebrity-filled world he had always wanted at the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministry, but lost it by surrounding himself with advisers who fed his need to be the star of the show, a new book says. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who was driven from the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministry more than two years ago in the midst of a sex-and-money scandal, goes on trial Monday on federal fraud and conspiracy charges. Jury selection begins Monday; opening arguments are expected a week later. The Rev. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, another television evangelist, took over the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministry in March 1987 as a caretaker under an agreement with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> put the ministry under bankruptcy protection three months later after uncovering a spreading web of alleged financial irregularities and millions of dollars in unpaid bills. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> `` survived at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> by creating a universe where right and wrong were relative; he wrote the rules, and if he needed to break one, he found reason to rewrite or ignore it,'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Observer </LOCATION> reporter, writes in his new book. `` <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> brought to <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> a set of absolute standards _ a crucible <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> could not survive.'' <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>'s coverage of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> from 1984 to 1987 led to <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s resignation and a Pulitzer Prize for the newspaper His book, `` Forgiven _ The Rise and Fall of <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and The <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>,'' is scheduled to be published by <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monthly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in mid-September. The book portrays <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> as a boyish charmer whose classmates in his hometown of <LOCATION> Muskegon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, believed was destined for a career in show business. He enrolled in Bible school in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, but dropped out after less than two years when he married his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>, and decided to become a traveling evangelist. A chance to do a Christian children's television show led the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s fledgling <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> and, eventually, to <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> in 1974, where <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> used his gift for fund-raising to turn a failing television station and a storefront studio into a satellite network and the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> theme park in neary <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>. As <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> grew, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> surrounded himself with aides willing to tell him what he wanted to hear, ministry insiders told <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> Executives who worried about <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s spontaneous on-camera decisions to finance projects, or questioned the funding for giant building projects at <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, suddenly found themselves out of favor, if not out of a job. Contractors for the water park at <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> ran into the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> philosophy when they asked why the ministry had n't done a study to determine what size the park should be and how much admission to charge. `` They were told not to press the subject; <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> got his inspiration from God, and that was sufficient cause for <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> to move ahead,'' <PERSON> Shephard </PERSON> wrote. `` PTL seemed confident that the audience for <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s TV program, the stream of visitors to <LOCATION> Heritage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, and the lifetime partners would generate the necessary traffic.'' Lifetime partners were investors in the park. Two of <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s former aides, brothers <PERSON> James </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>, have been convicted of evading taxes on $ 1.1 million in ministry funds they diverted to their own uses, including <ORGANIZATION> Cartier </ORGANIZATION> jewelry, designer clothes and a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> apartment. Scheduled for sentencing Friday, they each face maximum terms of 25 years in prison and $ 1 million in fines. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s top assistant at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, pleaded guilty earlier this month to four counts of conspiracy and fraud. He has agreed to testify against his former boss as part of a plea bargain, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Diehl </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>'s attorney. The Taggarts will consider testifying against <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, said their attorney, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotten </PERSON>. The book details some of the transactions that form the basis of the charges, saying <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> arranged bonuses for themselves to cover such personal expenses as the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION>' three homes. Prosecutors allege that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> pocketed some of the $ 158 million that poured into <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> from 1984 to 1987 under various `` lifetime partnership'' programs. In eight of the 11 programs, contributors were promised free lodging at <LOCATION> Heritage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> in exchange for a one-time donation of $ 1,000 or more. Instead of using all of the money to build hotels and other facilities at <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> to serve the partners, the indictment said, the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> executives spent more than $ 4 million on themselves and used some of it for operating expenses. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> got nearly $ 3.5 million in bonuses from 1984 through 1987 and <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> got $ 550,000 in bonuses while withholding informaton about <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s worsening financial problems from its board of directors, the indictment charged. Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was not charged. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who was listed among those interviewed for the book, has denied the charges against him but has declined to speak further with reporters. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned in March 1987 after being informed by The Charlotte Observer that the newspaper was ready to publish a story of a sexual liaison between former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> church secretary <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in 1980.

<HEAD>Chinese Defense Minister Reappears After Reports of His Arrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s defense minister appeared on national television Saturday despite reports that he was arrested in a power struggle with the President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON>. Senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> has been reported to be ill with cancer, and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> sources say his poor condition has touched off a power struggle between Defense Minister <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiwei </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> turns 85 on Tuesday. The sources had said troops loyal to <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> led <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> from his <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> home on Wednesday after the two argued about which of them should be promoted to first vice chairman of the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Some sources said <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> had been placed under house arrest, but the television appearance seemed to rule that out. The position of first vice chairman was held by former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> until he was stripped of all power in June during a purge resulting from the pro-democracy protests. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> led the crackdown that crushed the protests, while <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> was believed to oppose it. <PERSON> Qin </PERSON>, 75, was shown briefly Saturday in a news report on the funeral of <PERSON> Fu </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhong </PERSON>, a legislator and former colonel-general. The report did not identify him by name, but a later report by the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> listed him among the top officials attending. Some Chinese sources say <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>, 81, and <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> are jockeying for control of the army. The first vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> ranks second only to <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, who is chairman. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> now holds the separate, lower posts of permanent vice president and secretary general of the commission. <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> has been defense minister since April 1988. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, rather than the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, long has been the real decision-maker in military affairs. A Western diplomat said, however, the struggle goes even deeper. `` The general consensus here is that it's the top post, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s position, that is at stake,'' he said on condition of anonymity The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> denied to foreign reporters Friday that <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> was arrested or ousted as defense minister. However, it did not specifically deny he was detained by troops on <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>'s orders. A source in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> met Friday with top military commanders to discuss his appointment as first vice chairman but that the commanders did not express support. The source said <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s health is deteriorating rapidly. Military commanders who visited him this week found he could not speak, the source said. He said his information came from the wife of one commander and secretary of another. The Western diplomat said regional military commanders were opposing <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>'s moves because of his extensive family connections in the military. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> belongs to one of the strongest military families in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. His younger brother, <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Baibing </PERSON>, is director of the army's <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. His son-in-law, <PERSON> Chi </PERSON> <PERSON> Haotian </PERSON>, runs the headquarters of the army's General Staff. But the Chinese source in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> had obtained the support of some elderly retired conservatives and Vice President <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhen </PERSON>. In another development Saturday, a source at the <ORGANIZATION> Australian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said it had sheltered for more than two months a folk singer who was active in the pro-democracy movement. The singer, 33-year-old <PERSON> Hou </PERSON> <PERSON> Dejian </PERSON>, returned to his home in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on Wednesday, and official television showed him chatting with reporters the next day about the military assault on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> pro-democracy protesters on June 3-4. <PERSON> Hou </PERSON>, who helped negotiate safe passage of protesters out of <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, gave the official version of the crackdown in his comments. `` I did n't see that anyone was shot. There was no such thing as tanks crushing -LRB- people -RRB-,'' he said. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people were killed when government troops pushed toward the square to sweep out protesters. The Australian embassy source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Hou </PERSON> appoved of the conditions of his release to Chinese authorities. The source suggested Chinese authorities `` leaned on him'' to make his statements on television.

<HEAD>US Bars Cuban Pianist From New York Latin Festival</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> confirmed Saturday it has rejected a visa request from a top Cuban pianist and his band to play at a Latin arts festival in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a decision termed `` shortsighted, outdated and whimsical'' by the show's producer. The pianist, <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubalcaba </PERSON>, and his band, <PERSON> Grupo </PERSON> <PERSON> Proyecto </PERSON>, were scheduled to appear with jazz great <PERSON> Dizzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> in an open-air concert in Central Park on Monday, a free event which traditionally highlights the annual Festival Latino. <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> has called <PERSON> Rubalcaba </PERSON> `` the greatest pianist I've heard in the last 10 years'' and had sought him for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> show. However, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> turned down the visa request under terms of a 1985 proclamation by then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` which found unrestricted entry of <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government employees to be detrimental to the interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' according to spokeswoman <PERSON> Sondra </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarty </PERSON>. Almost all Cuban artists are paid by their government. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> producer <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Papp </PERSON>, whose Public Threatre organizes the Latin arts festival, called the department's decision `` shortsighted, outdated and whimsical. ... It is counterproductive and ends up as an attack against artists whose presence poses no threat to national security.'' <PERSON> Papp </PERSON> noted that three Cuban filmmakers were granted visas to participate in the same festival. In a letter to Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON>, he wrote, `` When you seem to have no problem granting visas to three Cuban fimmakers and deny eight musicians entry, the rationale seems strained.'' Ms. <PERSON> McCarty </PERSON> could not explain the apparent discrepancy in the way the requests were handled, other than to say `` waivers are occasionally granted. However, we determined that waivers were not appropriate in the case of Grupo Proyecto.'' <PERSON> Rubalcaba </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> met when the trumpeter played at <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s Jazz Plaza festival in 1985 The American jazz artist invited the pianist to perform with him in the film `` A Night in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>,'' which documented <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Despite Caution, U.S. Spearheading Relief Effort for Poland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 While the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is reacting with caution to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s decision to form a non-communist government, efforts are ongoing to provide its faltering economy with nearly $ 1 billion of relief. `` The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> does n't dance in the streets, I'm sorry,'' said department spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>, reflecting the restrained official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reaction to a week of momentous events. Despite the nomination Saturday of Solidarity trade union activist <PERSON> Tadeuz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> to be <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s first non-communist prime minister in more than four decades, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> should expect no further increases in direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. `` We will continue to watch the process and will increase aid as appropriate and as we can,'' presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters at the summer <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. Behind the austere facade, however, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is pushing a multinational effort to provide <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> with nearly $ 1 billion in extra cash this year by pressuring Western banks and governments to reschedule the $ 39 billion debt it owes. The multilateral steps also include <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> decisions, with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> impetus, `` to move forward with two economically viable project loans, one on industrial development and one on agricultural development, which total $ 325 million,'' said <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>. That effort does n't begin to approach the $ 10 billion in Western help that Solidarity chairman <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> sought in a meeting with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last month in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. But it is a start. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> then that he could provide only $ 119 million in direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> sources this week predicted <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will approve the $ 119 million but is unlikely to increase it. `` The fact is that bilateral aid is not what the Poles need. It is splashy and cheers them on, but they really need multilateral aid, help on their debt,'' said an aide to Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> has been one of the most ardent congressional advocates of helping <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and has advised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to take the multilateral road. `` There is a very real limit on the amount of aid that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can provide'' because of its own budget deficits, said the <PERSON> Rostenskowski </PERSON> aide, who spoke on condition he not be further identified. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s $ 119 million aid package is tailored to accelerating the collapse of socialism in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. It earmarks $ 100 million over three years to create and run a <ORGANIZATION> Polish-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> that will channel low-cost loans to Poles trying to start capitalist enterprises. The package also includes 16,000 tons of food this year and an additional $ 50 million worth in 1990, as well as $ 15 million to clean up air and water pollution in <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>, the ancient Polish capital. While the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains that its own financial problems preclude additional help for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, political considerations also are behind the restrained reaction to the events there this week. `` It's too early at this point to know how they -LRB- <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s leaders -RRB- are going to make it work, let alone how it will work,'' said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conservatives were uncomfortable with <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s assurances to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that Communists will retain sensitive cabinet posts controlling the armed forces and the police under the Solidarity-led government and the <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> will not leave the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> military alliance. Key among them is Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, who as the ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, has the potential power to hamper any aid package. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> opposes spending more money on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> until it breaks with the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact or dismantles its communist system, said an aide to him. `` A great deal of glasnost, as far as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is concerned, is for the West to subsidize the failure of the communist system,'' said the aide, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Boney </PERSON>. `` We certainly want to wait until there has been a divorce from communism before we commit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxpayer dollars.''

<TEXT>
 A former police officer who forced a woman to perform a sex act by threatening to have her put in jail was sentenced to 10 years in prison. State District Judge <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanford </PERSON> gave the maximum term Friday to <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoy </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>, 42, for violating the civil rights of a 27-year-old widow he stopped on a highway last year on a possible drinking offense. The sentenced followed widespread public outcry this month when another former officer was initially given probation in a similar incident. <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> planned to appeal. <PERSON> Lanford </PERSON> said a probationary sentence would have infuriated some people while a prison term likely would anger others. `` Politically, there's no right solution,'' <PERSON> Lanford </PERSON> said. `` I'm going to do what a judge is paid to do. Earlier this month, another former <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> officer, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cebula </PERSON>, 29, was granted 10-year probation by a jury that convicted him of raping an intoxicated woman he purportedly had arrested. The probation was widely criticized, and state District Judge <PERSON> Lupe </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> subsequently imposed a lengthy list of probationary conditions, including a 120-day jail stay. Character witnesses and <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McQuillen </PERSON>, had asked <PERSON> Lanford </PERSON> not to imprison <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>. <PERSON> McQuillen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>'s `` bad side'' had been exorcised when he was fired over the case. <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> stopped the victim at 2:30 a.m. on Feb. 9, 1988, soon after she left a bar. The woman testified <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> told her she would be taken to jail where she would risk being abused by lesbian prisoners. She said <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> asked her what she might be willing to do to avoid arrest. When she asked if he was soliciting money, <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> named the specific sex act she could perform to avert a trip to jail. `` He kept harping on her,'' prosecutor <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Smyth </PERSON> said. `` He kept driving around and telling her: ` You're going to go to jail. There are a lot of mean women there.''' <PERSON> Smyth </PERSON> said the woman began submitting but balked again when <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> began undressing. <PERSON> Smyth </PERSON> said <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> then forced her to comply.

<HEAD>Pentagon Pushing to Cut Down on Paper</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Pentagon is quietly moving ahead with a plan to wean bureaucrats, battleships and bombers from unwieldy stacks of printed paperwork and convert them to compact, cost-effective computer disks. The effort comes in response to a weighty problem: a modern <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warship carries 15 to 25 tons of operating, maintenance and repair manuals; the B-1B bomber has generated 1 million pages of how-to documentation. The Pentagon says the campaign could reduce the lifetime cost of major weapons by up to 20 percent by converting masses of printed technical information into computerized databases. The cost for technical data delivered with military hardware ranges from 10 percent to 30 percent of the total weapon system price tag. Add to that the millions of dollars that must be spent, year after year, to keep the manuals up to date. To spearhead the conversion of printed data to electronic form, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in September 1985 launched a program called Computer-Aided Acquisition and Logistics Support, or CALS. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lepisto </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> CALS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, said each of the military services has selected particular weapons to lead the way in carrying out the computerization effort. For the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, he said, these lead systems are the Advanced Tactical Fighter and the B-2 Stealth bomber; for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, the A-12 attack aircraft and SSN-21 Seawolf class attack submarine; and for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, the LHX helicopter and M1-A2 tank. <PERSON> Lepisto </PERSON> acknowledged that there had been some problem weaning military personnel as well as defense contractors from reliance on traditional paper documents. `` We're talking about a major cultural change here,'' he said. `` Some people are overly anxious and want to rush in. And some people feel that better is the enemy of good enough. What we're implementing is a new way of doing business And certainly there are going to be people that want to go either faster or slower.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pechersky </PERSON>, co-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> CALS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, representing hundreds of defense contractors, said, `` We're still in the very early stages This is a massive undertaking. From my own personal perspective, I think we're doing very well.'' `` The first several years have been devoted to trying to get our act together _ to decide what we want to do and how we want to do it. And more importantly, to try and get agreement on some of the early digital -LRB- information -RRB- exchange standards that have to be put in place,'' he said. <PERSON> Pechersky </PERSON>, corporate director of management information systems for <ORGANIZATION> E-Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, said the program is `` evolutionary, not revolutionary. We'll see various implementations of CALS well into the year 2000.'' The CALS program involves development of standardized text and image formats so that electronic data can be readily exchanged between a wide variety of different computer systems within the military and at defense contractors. The Seybold Report on Publishing Systems, a publishing industry newsletter based in <LOCATION> Media </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, has forecast that <ORGANIZATION> CALS </ORGANIZATION> eventually will have a major impact spreading far beyond the defense industry. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, associate editor of the newsletter, observed that `` the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> handles so much printing and so much electronic information that they are the classic 800-pound gorilla. Whatever they do sets a standard.'' `` Every aspect of the publishing industry is coming to grips with this electronic dissemination of information,'' he said. `` And they're sort of mucking around, not quite knowing how to do it, because it's still a difficult technology. `` What the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has done is simply issued a fiat, ` This is how you shall do it.' Having said so, they're going to make it so. Large other chunks of the industry are going to go that way simply because the vendors of electronic systems will have already written the software to do it for DoD,'' <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> may consider herself the queen of hotels, but she's discovered her sovereignty is not recognized in the court of law. For six weeks, prosecution witnesses at her trial on a 47-count federal indictment have portrayed Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> as an abusive boss who evaded taxes by charging personal expenses to her business, extorted kickbacks from liquor suppliers and did n't pay her bills. Even her lawyer conceded she was `` demanding'' and `` abrasive.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, 69 _ who with her husband, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>, heads a $ 5 billion real estate empire _ has said not a word publicly about the stories of greed and arrogance presented by the prosecution, which rested its case Tuesday after presenting 44 witnesses and thousands of pages of documents. Through it all, Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> has done her best to remain remote and regal. Her head held high, she listened, occasionally jotted notes and whispered comments to her lawyers. Though always fashionably dressed, Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> has not flaunted her wealth. She wore tailored suits and simple jewelry like a single strand of pearls and a gold wedding band. Well-trained in courtroom procedure, she often was the first to rise when the jury entered the room. She would look directly at the jurors and give them a friendly nod. How or if Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s courtroom demeanor will affect the jurors remains to be seen. The jurors heard from contractors about their battles to get paid for renovation work at Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> estate, <PERSON> Dunnellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>. She disputed many bills, negotiated lesser payments and ultimately had much of the cost, $ 3.1 million, paid for by Helmsley-owned businesses, testimony has shown. The jurors also will consider a document that claims she charged more than $ 320,000 in personal purchases to the Park Lane Hotel. These charges ranged from $ 32 for insect repellent, a $ 58 `` Itty Bitty Book Light'' and $ 60 in undergarments to nearly $ 3,000 for cuff links and tens of thousands of dollars in designer clothing. The jury also has heard three liquor vendors testify they were forced by Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s top aide, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Turco </PERSON>, to pay hefty kickbacks to keep their accounts at <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> hotels. In testimony July 25, a former <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> executive, <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Meckler </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Turco </PERSON> once held up several envelopes and said, `` This is cash. This is what Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> wants.'' But the jurors wo n't hear Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s version of events. Her lead lawyer, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Feffer </PERSON>, says she will not take the stand. Her two co-defendants, <PERSON> Turco </PERSON> and another former aide, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Licari </PERSON>, also will not testify. The defense will wrap up the trial next week with testimony from two audit experts who claim the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION>, rather than evading $ 681,000 in taxes, actually are owed refunds. Her lawyers say she overpaid taxes for 1983, 1984 and 1985 because she did not properly depreciate a tax-shelter investment. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said Friday that waiting until the trial was nearly over to make the claim `` smacks of a desperate need,'' but it will be allowed. A key part of the defense is that the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> used Dunnellen Hall for business purposes. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, 80, also was charged but was found incompetent to stand trial. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> has surrounded herself with lawyers and family members during breaks in testimony. Security employees escort her to and from her limousine at the beginning and end of each day. She lunches in the courthouse cafeteria. At the beginning of the trial, she ate the cafeteria food but now is brought sandwiches from an outside deli. While avoiding contact with reporters, she sometimes stops to chat with the courtroom artists who draw scenes for television and newspaper reports. `` I'll kill myself if I look like that,'' she once joked, as she looked over an artist's shoulder. The judge imposed a gag order preventing lawyers and defendants from discussing the case with the media and Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> does not answer questions from reporters on any subject. When an advertising company dropped the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotels </ORGANIZATION> account during the trial, Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> was asked for comment. She zipped her lips. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s imperious armor has shown some cracks. She became teary-eyed on several occasions when the death of her son from a previous marriage came up in testimony. She joined in the laughter when <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennehy </PERSON> read from a document that she had charged a $ 21 yearly membership fee for a crossword puzzle club to one of her luxury hotels. And once, she gave a big smile of relief _ when the government rested.

<HEAD>State Department Blamed for Lax Enforcement of Import Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is unable to enforce sanctions banning imports of gold and other products from state-owned enterprises in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> because the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has not identified the banned items, congressional watchdogs said Saturday. Without a list of specific products to work from, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has been largely ineffective in enforcing the import ban passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said. Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., who requested the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> study, said it pointed to a `` shocking lapse by top <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials, who failed to apply elementary enforcement procedures in carrying out the anti-apartheid law. The legislation, which was approved over former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto, banned imports of a variety of goods from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, including products of so-called parastatals _ entities owned or controlled by the South African government. `` The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issued a list of South African government agencies and state-owned corporations that it designated as parastatals but did not identify the products produced, marketed or exported by them,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Because products associated with parastatals have not been identified, Customs can not use trade data, which is kept on a product-by-product basis, to obtain leads on illegal imports from parastatals,'' it added. While direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports of South African gold ceased in 1987, the bullion could still be entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> illegally by transshipment through <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, which market much of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s gold, according to the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>. Between January 1987 and March 1989 British exports of gold to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> totaled $ 175 million and Swiss gold exports to this country came to $ 164 million, the watchdogs said. `` Because it was not widely known in Customs that gold was under the parastatal sanction, it could not use data on trade flows to obtain leads on illegal trade and could not identify possible transshipment of South African gold to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> through third countries,'' the report said. As the result of its inquiry, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> officials said the Customs agency is now investigating whether some gold from <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> is of South African origin and is entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> illegally.

 The civil rights coalition <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> put together more than three decades ago was having a foot-stompin' good time in <LOCATION> Ebenezer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baptist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION> last week Marchers from the movement's high time swayed and clapped to gospel music. Movement royalty _ King's widow, sister and three of his children _ were on hand for festivities that lasted until midnight. But one person was noticeably absent: <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>. He called himself `` the son of a son of a movement'' when he became president of his father's memorial center, but left the center in a huff four months later amid a reported power struggle with his mother, <PERSON> Coretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>. King, 28, the youngest son, has kept a low profile since his resignation Aug. 4 from the <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. Center for Nonviolent Social Change <PERSON> Neigher </PERSON> he nor his mother responded to repeated requests for interviews. The King Center's directors emerged from a six-hour meeting Wednesday with a new job for King, but they have not announced what it is. King has given no indication whether he will accept the job. The directors have said the center's presidency will remain vacant and they consider the matter basically resolved. As the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> convened here last week, there were several who identified with <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s position: that of a young leader who wants his ideas heard in a movement where the old guard is reluctant to surrender control Among them was <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, D-Ga., a leader in the <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Non-Violent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> during the 1960s <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, 49, said such power struggles were a problem nearly 30 years ago. `` The sit-ins and the Freedom Rides in <ORGANIZATION> SNCC </ORGANIZATION> were also a revolt against the old leadership,'' he said. `` What made it different in that period was we had been provided a role, and a place at the table. `` You can not take the dream ... to participate, put it in a bottle and put a cap on it. We should open the doors, make young people feel welcome.'' `` One thing about <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> _ he welcomed the involvement of young people,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. `` He praised the vigor they could bring to a struggle.'' Civil rights leaders, many of whom have acted as surrogate fathers to <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s children, said they are concerned about <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s welfare. `` I do plan to talk to him,'' said <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors and a longtime King family friend. `` I think some mistakes were made on both sides. `` I think he's amenable to working it out. He loves the center and I'm sure he wants to be involved in the vital work the center does.'' But another King aide, <PERSON> Hosea </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, said, `` He ai n't going back in there.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said King left because the center's leaders, by giving him the role of `` president-in-training,'' showed they were unwilling to give him power to change things `` They killed the boy's spirit. He sees now how costly it is, how tough it is to be a true leader,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` They talking about training. What kind of training does he need?'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> asked. `` Old age is the inability to accept change. And that is just the problem that <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> ran into.'' The Rev. Tony Minor, 30, could readily identify with what <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> experienced. Minor, the <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION>'s youngest chapter president, pulled together a conference chapter in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, that, after eight months, has 150 members _ mostly people under 35. A graduate of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s alma mater, <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, Minor spent five years as an aide for <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, learning how to move his ministry into the community and listening to stories about the movement days. Minor said the <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION> has made room at the top for youth before, and he does n't mind waiting for his day in the sun. `` The challenge is for younger leaders to respect and support veterans who have been around,'' he said. `` Those veterans should, in turn, adopt the young leaders, teach them, support them.'' But <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said, `` Young leaders must not back up or submit to old leaders like me.'' `` They've just got to come up and push old leaders on out of the way,'' he said. `` Old leaders must realize ... we should voluntarily allow the young leaders to take over and meet today's challenge. `` If we do n't do that, then what we have suffered for will perish.''

 Police used whips and dogs to disperse hundreds of blacks, including Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, during mass protests Saturday at two whites-only beaches. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> was carried shoulder-high onto the first beach targeted by the demonstrators and later appealed to protesters at the other beach to leave when he saw them being beaten with whips by police. `` We have proved these are God's beaches,'' he said. The Black Sash civil rights group said several protesters sustained open wounds from the whips. The group said its monitors at the second beach `` watched with horror'' as officers charged families eating picnic lunches and used a helicopter to blow sand on them. About 15 journalists covering the first protest, at The Strand beach east of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, were detained for two hours. Nearer to the city, a black constable was killed by a group of youths, police said. According to reports that local newspapers received from a human rights lawyer, four black civilians also were injured and about 35 people arrested in clashes that broke out when protesters were stopped from boarding buses to the beach. Those reports could not be confirmed. Learning that The Strand had been sealed off with roadblocks, several hundred blacks went to <LOCATION> Bloubergstrand </LOCATION>, a segregated beach just north of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, who had strolled along The Strand beach before he and fellow demonstrators were dispersed, arrived at <LOCATION> Bloubergstrand </LOCATION> to see police whipping protesters. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> climbed onto the back of a pick-up truck and successfully persuaded the protesters to withdrew. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>'s press aide, said some white onlookers yelled insults at the archbishop. Police also arrested at least 25 anti-apartheid demonstrators in <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, and banned a major rally that had been called for Sunday in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> to declare that outlawed opposition groups were back in operation. Police Commissioner <PERSON> Hennie </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> warned organizers of the escalating nationwide campaign of defiance that `` lawlessness and anarchy will not be tolerated.'' Leaders of the campaign announced several days ago that blacks would have a picnic Saturday on the segregated white beach at The Strand. Late Friday, police and soldiers cordoned off a three-mile stretch of whites-only beachfront and erected signs saying the beach was closed because of a police dog-training exercise. Roadblocks were erected, and some blacks arriving in buses to join the protest were turned back. But <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> and about 300 other protesters reached the beach area, and the archbishop was carried onto the sand on the shoulders of some of the crowd before they were dispersed by police equipped with whips and guard dogs. Some of the group then went to a neighboring town, <LOCATION> Gordon </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, leader of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, held an impromptu news conference. `` It is incredible that the government is prepared to use arms on people who wish to have a picnic,'' he said. `` Instead of getting rid of beach apartheid, they protect it with policemen, dogs and guns.'' The detained journalists, many of them representing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British news organizations, were allowed to go free after film and videotapes were confiscated. Police said the journalists had failed to obey an order to leave the area. In the port city of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, 16 activists were arrested as they stood outside a beachfront hotel protesting the presence of an international all-star rugby team. The team's five-match tour to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has been approved by international rugby officials, but militants have depicted the visit as a breach of the sports boycott imposed to protest apartheid. Police said nine people were arrested in downtown <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> after scores of blacks chanted in the streets during a protest against the arrest Friday of anti-apartheid activist <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Valli </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON>. Several demonstrators carried placards with the initials of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which was banned last year. Organizers of the defiance campaign had planned several rallies on Sunday to proclaim that the anti-apartheid coalition had `` unbanned'' itself. One rally has been banned and similar action was expected against the others. The campaign began Aug. 3, when blacks sought treatment at white hospitals, and has spread as the Sept. 6 parliamentary elections approach. The state radio Saturday said police must `` respond imaginatively'' in order to counter civil disobedience without triggering violence.

 The pro-Iranian group <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> of favoring Lebanese Christians over Moslems and hinted that new attacks may be mounted on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> targets. Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s main Lebanese ally, ordered a general mobilization in his 200,000-member Druse community to prepare for a major battle against the Christians, Moslem sources said. Police said two people were killed and nine wounded in clashes between Syrian troops and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> forces along <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Christian-Moslem dividing line and three other fronts in the central Lebanese mountains and in north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> The new casualties raised the overall toll to 781 killed and 2,118 wounded since fighting broke out March 8 between Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s mainly Christian army units and Syrian troops backed by <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Spradic exchanges have broken a general lull prevailing since the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> appealed Tuesday for a cease-fire. In its statement published by <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspapers, <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, accused <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and the pope of favoring Lebanese Christians in the 14-year-old civil war with Moslems. `` The French naval buildup in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, the Pope's fanatic and biased stands, and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s moves at the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Security Council are part of the arrogant campaign aimed at taming the Moslems,'' it said `` This campaign will only lead to failure because the era of the crusaders' invasion is gone following the spread of the spirit of martyrdom that forced the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- Marines and the French to retreat in 1983,'' it said. That was a reference to the twin suicide truck bomb attacks on Oct. 23, 1983, against the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> base and the headquarters of <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> paratroopers in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The bombings killed 241 American servicemen and 58 French soldiers and led to withdrawal of an international peace force. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is believed to be an umbrella for underground extremists holding 16 foreign hostages, including eight Americans, in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The longest-held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985. In a separate interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> newsletter, an unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> official was quoted as saying <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should immediately release an influential Moslem Shiite cleric abducted by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> commandos last month. The kidnapping prompted one group to announce it had killed an American hostage, Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, in retaliation. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> dispatched the aircraft carrier <ORGANIZATION> Foch </ORGANIZATION>, the destroyer <PERSON> Cassard </PERSON>, and the destroyer <ORGANIZATION> Duquesne </ORGANIZATION> to the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> in recent days while its envoy, <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Decaux </PERSON>, discussed the crisis with Lebanese officials. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who serves as army commander and leader of a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, was quoted Saturday as saying he would like to see French forces get involved. `` I would like a French military intervention, but I do n't want to compromise <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> with a <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> request. Up until now, we have exhausted much of our human and material resources, and we need help to continue the resistance,'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> was quoted in an interview in the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> weekly Journal du <PERSON> Dimanche </PERSON>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 20,000 troops are outnumbered by Syrian's 40,000 soldiers and its allies. The Syrian soldiers came under terms of a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. French officials say the movement of their forces in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> was designed to help evacuate the estimated 7,000 French citizens if necessary. They say <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> has no intention of intervening militarily. One source close to the <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s group said his militia's military police toured a Druse enclave in the <LOCATION> Chouf </LOCATION> mountains in recent days `` instructing all physically fit men aged 16-40 to report to party offices. The source spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> also has been critical of the French naval buildup. He said at a news conference Saturday: `` <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> still supports the Maronites.'' He was referring to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>' strong links to the Christians before <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s independence in 1943. `` If they insist -LRB- on intervening -RRB-, then let the whole of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and the whole of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eest </LOCATION> go up in flames,'' he said. The pope has expressed outrage at the recent fighting in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and last week said he felt an `` imperative'' to visit the country.

<HEAD>Rafsanjani Drops Hard-line Rivals From New Cabinet</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> defied half the lawmakers in parliament on Saturday by nominating a Cabinet that would remove his hard-line rivals from power and replace them with allies. The attempt to oust rivals who probably would oppose his political and economic policies raised criticism in parliament, which must approve all 22 ministers in the new Cabinet individually. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> is viewed as a pragmatist, seeking more private investment and links with the West to obtain the technology and financing to rebuild the economy shattered by eight years of war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Three major hard-liners not included in the new Cabinet are <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON>, the interior minister; <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>, the prime minister; and <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Rey-Shahri </PERSON>, the minister of intelligence. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, Oil Minister <PERSON> Gholemreza </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> and Minister of Islamic Guidance <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Khatami </PERSON> will all keep their posts, the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said in a reported monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON> is a middle-ranking cleric who was appointed interior minister in October 1985 after serving as ambassador to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> from 1981. He is considered the head of the hard-line faction in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Earlier Saturday, the <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, a government-supervised newspaper close to <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON> would be ousted, prompting 138 deputies in the 270-seat Majlis, or parliament, to sign a petition demanding he be kept on. In the petition, the deputies acknowledged the men were rivals, but said: `` The presence of powerful personalities in the future Cabinet is inevitable.'' The deputies urged <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> to appoint <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON>, noting the `` sensitivity of the arrogant world'' _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ to the issue. The petition was read in parliament Saturday and carried by Iranian news agency. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> warned during his inauguration speech Thursday that a fight was brewing over his appointments, but said he wanted to eliminate political infighting to concentrate on overhauling the economy and feeding <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s poor. The new president was elected in a landslide July 28. The <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION>, the main Iranian opposition group, said in a telex to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that Saturday's parliamentary session was chaotic. The Baghdad-based group said <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> rushed the nominations to parliament when he heard the petition was being written. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, a middle-ranking cleric, emerged as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s strongman after the June 3 death of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, architect of the 1979 Islamic revolution. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s ideological rivals support a centralized economy and believe confronting the West feeds the revolution's Islamic fervor. <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON> and his allies have spearheaded efforts to export the revolution through extremist groups such as <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The strength of <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s government, especially its ability to rebuff the hard-line faction, ultimately will decide the shape and speed of new economic and foreign policy initiatives. The fight will determine whether <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will sign a peace treaty with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and pressure pro-Iranian groups in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to release 16 Western hostages, including eight Americans. The key position in the battle, the interior minister, controls <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s police forces; its revolutionary committees, which enforce Islamic laws; and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s 24 provincial governors, many of them his appointees. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> would replace <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON> with <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Nouri </PERSON>, a leading figure in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Revolutionary Guards, the most fervent branch of the military. <PERSON> Nouri </PERSON> is a <ORGANIZATION> Majlis </ORGANIZATION> deputy for the central city of <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION> and chairman of the Planning and <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He was <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s representative with the Revolutionary Guards, with powers to appoint and dismiss its commanders Also a middle-ranking cleric, he was named by <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> in April 1989 to the committee that amended the 1979 constitution. <PERSON> Rey-Shahri </PERSON>, the intelligence minister, will be succeeded by his deputy, middle-ranking cleric <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Fallahian </PERSON>, the Iranian news agency said. <PERSON> Fallahian </PERSON> has been a key official in the security apparatus, particularly in the campaign against the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION>. Both nominees are considered <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> allies. Constitutional changes approved by the voters July 28 eliminated the post of prime minister, concentrating executive power in the presidency.

 Israeli forces shot and killed two Palestinians on Saturday, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> asked <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to investigate the shooting death of a Palestinian-American boy whose body was found in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Also Saturday, a committee representing lawyers who appear in military courts said it will end on Monday a month-long strike even though it did not achieve its goal: better treatment of Palestinian defendants. The army confirmed two Palestinians were killed by soldiers Saturday, but it denied it was involved in the death of the Palestinian-American. The deaths raised to 537 the number of Palestinians who have been killed in their uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> since it began in December 1987. Thirty-eight Israelis have also died. Arab reports said an 18-year-old Palestinian was shot and killed Saturday by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> security agents in a market in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>. They said Palestinians began stoning a patrol when men dressed in plain clothes with cameras around their necks pulled out guns and opened fire. <PERSON> Radi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> was fatally wounded in the chest and four Arabs were shot and wounded, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The market, located near the Church of the Nativity, is frequented by tourists. The church marked the spot where <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> is believed to be born. An army spokesman said a patrol opened fire after it was attacked with stones and bottles and confirmed one Palestinian was killed and four wounded. In the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shaaban </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Seksek </PERSON>, 50, was fatally wounded by army gunfire in the town of <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION> during a clash between stone-throwing protesters and soldiers, the army spokesman said. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulate </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has asked <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to investigate the death of <PERSON> Amjad </PERSON> <PERSON> Husain </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibreen </PERSON>, a 15-year-old Palestinian - American who was born in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> The spokesman, <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Jibreen </PERSON>'s family reported him missing Thursday after he failed to return from prayer services in <LOCATION> el-Bireh </LOCATION>, a town in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> said consular officials visited the family and asked the military for information on his death but had received no conclusive answers. <PERSON> Jibreen </PERSON>'s cousin, <PERSON> Ayman </PERSON>, said the teen-ager was involved in a demonstration against Israeli troops after prayer services and fled to the hills surrounding <LOCATION> el-Bireh </LOCATION> to avoid arrest. He said <PERSON> Amjad </PERSON>'s body was discovered Saturday moring by a shepherd in the hills near <LOCATION> el-Bireh </LOCATION> and was quickly buried before funeral arrangements could be made. The army routinely takes the bodies of Palestinians shot in protests to examine the circumstances of death. <PERSON> Jibreen </PERSON> said he saw the body after it was discovered and that it appeared that his cousin was shot at close range. `` There were burns on his body, some of his teeth were knocked out, and there was a bullet in his chest,'' he said. He said the family contacted the army Thursday, a day after <PERSON> Jibreen </PERSON> failed to return home, and were told the military `` had no information on him.'' `` But Friday afternoon they said he had been arrested,'' <PERSON> Jibreen </PERSON> said. `` Now they are telling us they have never heard of him.'' <PERSON> Jibreen </PERSON> said he believes his cousin was shot by the army shortly after his arrest. <PERSON> Amjad </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibreen </PERSON> moved to his mother's home town of <LOCATION> el-Bireh </LOCATION> in 1983. His father, <PERSON> Wathak </PERSON>, lives in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The 220-member <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday that it will end its strike despite having achieved few gains. The committee is composed of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> lawyers, but it has four Israeli members. `` I think we have achieved nothing,'' said committee member <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayad </PERSON>. Commitee leader <PERSON> Bahij </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamami </PERSON> said, `` Our purpose was to protest and tell the word that there is no justice in <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> courts.'' He said the committee had demanded the army promptly report arrests or detentions to families, translate charge sheets from Hebrew to Arabic and provide better treatment of prisoners. The lawyers committee also held a two-month strike beginning in January, and said it produced few results. During the strikes Palestinians either represented themselves or sought the counsel of the few lawyers who are not members of the committee. Many major cases were delayed until the end of the strike. The army says 9,136 Palestinians are currently in <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> jails for uprising-related offenses.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Saturday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is prepared to coordinate `` as expeditiously as possible'' the extradition of suspected Colombian drug dealers after the assassination Friday of a leading <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> presidential candidate near <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. `` We in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not forget that others are paying very high costs for the unchecked rampage of the international criminals trafficking in cocaine and undermining the lives of law-abiding citizens,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a statement issued from <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> where he is vacationing. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> said Friday night he was reinstating under state-of-emergency powers an extradition treaty between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and his country that was voided on a technicality in April 1988 by the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Barco announced the measure after Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, a leading candidate to succeed <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s president, was shot just before he was scheduled to give a campaign speech in <LOCATION> Soacha </LOCATION>, about 20 miles south of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. At least 10 others were wounded in the shotgun attack, which police blamed on drug lords. Hours earlier, a provincial police chief who had led a campaign against drug lords was shot by five gunmen less than 200 yards from his home. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is appalled by what it called the `` latest round of vicious attacks by the Colombian drug cartels against innocent Colombians.'' `` These brazen attacks against Colombian judges, law enforcement officials and politicians dramatically demonstrate that unwavering international cooperation is essential if we are to win the war against the narcotics Mafias,'' the statement said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called Barco's reinstatement of the extradition treaty a `` courageous move'' and said he welcomed it in the fight against `` narcotraffickers.'' `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is ready to coordinate the extradition of these criminals as expeditiously as possible,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I have instructed the departments of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and Justice to begin working on this immediately.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said he is `` considering alternative ways to do more for the Andean countries'' in the national drug strategy he is scheduled to announce on Sept. 5. `` I am ready to meet with President <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> at the earliest convenient moment to consider a coordinated approach to this problem,'' he said. `` <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> must know that we stand by its efforts to move aggressively against these criminals who seek to destroy both our societies.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not specify the alternatives under consideration for helping <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. But his national security adviser, <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said they include providing `` some help to shore up their efforts against, really, what are private armies inside their country.'' `` As you can see, the whole of the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government is under attack now by the drug cartels,'' Scowcroft said in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and <PERSON> Novak </PERSON> program.

 Tens of thousands of people demonstrated in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> on Saturday to demand that Communist authorities free jailed members of an independent group and accept its political demands. <PERSON> Nazim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ragimov </PERSON>, a journalist and interpreter, said 600,000 protesters jammed <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> province. <PERSON> Aidin </PERSON> <PERSON> Amirbekov </PERSON>, a member of the group, the <ORGANIZATION> Azerbijani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, said 200,000 attended. There were no immediate reports on the rally in state-run media. <PERSON> Ragimov </PERSON>, speaking by telephone from <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>, a city of 1.7 million on the <LOCATION> Caspian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> officials reported to the crowd on talks they held with <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, <PERSON> Abdul-Rakhman </PERSON> <PERSON> Vezirov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ragimov </PERSON> quoted the group's leaders as saying Vezirov only accepted one of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> demands during talks that ended Friday. The journalist said the party chief agreed to back efforts to disband a special committee created by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in February to administer <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a mostly Armenian region of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. The dispute over <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> has inflamed relations between <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, which has controlled the district since 1923. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> claims that far from being neutral, Moscow-based authorities are pro-Armenian and that the committee they created has led to a loss of Azerbaijani sovereignty. <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> leaders said <PERSON> Vezirov </PERSON> rejected their other demands, including annulment of the results of this spring's legislative elections and the freeing of <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> militants such as <PERSON> Naimat </PERSON> <PERSON> Panakhov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fuat </PERSON> <PERSON> Agayev </PERSON> who were detained during mass political rallies in <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> late last year. <PERSON> Ragimov </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> members and supporters will meet again Sept. 2 and declare a general strike if their demands have not been granted. A protest strike called Monday by the grassroots group over the same issues led to the walkout of about 1 percent of <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>'s 1 million workers, according to journalists at <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>'s state-run Azerinform news agency.

<HEAD>Gandhi Sees Bigger World Role for India</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> said Saturday that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> must play a bigger role in world affairs with the superpowers shifting from Cold War politics to more dialogue. In an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> also said he feared a hasty withdrawal of Indian peacekeeping troops from <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> could lead to partition of the island between the Sinhalese majority and Tamil minority. He said he expected his own national elections, due no later than January, to be held `` more or less on schedule.'' While he declined to be more specific, he indicated early elections were unlikely. `` I feel <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> must play a bigger role and will play a bigger role, and the global equations are changing. People are coming out of their old mindsets,'' the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> leader said during the interview. `` That's where countries like <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> can play a much bigger role, like we have done in the non-aligned -LRB- movement -RRB-, like we have done in disarmament _ really bringing the opposition poles together, getting nations to think more in terms of one world, not our bloc and their bloc.'' <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> has maintained his country's strong ties with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that date back to the days of his grandfather, <PERSON> Jawaharlal </PERSON> <PERSON> Nehru </PERSON>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s first prime minister, and his mother and predecessor, Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. But he also has broadened ties with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, especially in trade and technology. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> is the world's second-most populous nation with 880 million people. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has 1.2 billion people. During the interview, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> said the withdrawal of the 40,000 Indian soldiers from <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> still was under discussion with the <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> government, which has demanded a speedy pullout. `` What's worrying us is that if we come -LRB- back -RRB- without something else taking our place and things get out of control, it will lead to the division of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>,'' he said. He said <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has asked <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, whose armed forces barely total 40,000, how it proposes to deal with security after an Indian withdrawal. `` Just moving out and leaving a vacuum is not really a solution,'' he said. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, spurred by the sympathies of its own Tamil minority for Tamil secessionists in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, sponsored a 1987 peace accord to end a separatist revolt in the north and east of the small <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island. The largest Tamil rebel group rejected the plan, and Indian soldiers sent to enforce it were soon bogged down in a guerrilla war against the same Tamil militants <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> once supported. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, who turns 45 on Sunday, looked relaxed and confident during the interview as he sat in the private cabin of the Indian air force <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 that carried him and his entourage on a two-day tour of south <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. The trip, which was a campaign tour in everything but name, was taking him across <LOCATION> Karnataka </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Andhra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> states to make 13 speeches in 28 hours. During the interview, he repeatedly blasted the political opposition, especially the fractious alliance called the <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dal </ORGANIZATION>, or National Front. Its president, <PERSON> Viswanath </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratap </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, was once <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s finance minister and later his defense minister. In jam-packed sports stadiums, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> told crowds that the opposition sought to divide the country along lines of religion and caste and oppress women and poor people. In the interview, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> predicted his party would do `` very well'' in the upcoming national elections. But he would not estimate how many seats it would win. His victory in December 1984 gave his party an unprecendented 415 of the 544 seats in the policy-setting lower house of Parliament. A poll published in the Aug. 31 issue of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> Today, a respected national news magazine, projected <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would win 314 seats in the next elections.

 A woman who was hit in the arm by a stray bullet while dining in a 31st-floor apartment says she's uneasy the police have n't got a clue to where the shot came from. `` I understand the police are terribly busy, and there's a lot of crime going on,'' <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Downward </PERSON> said last week. `` But someone out there has a gun ... that they are shooting randomly.'' Ms. Downward was eating in a friend's top-floor apartment on chic <LOCATION> Rittenhouse </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> on Aug. 3 when she was hit. `` I had just taken a bite of grilled tuna when I heard a crack,'' she said. `` I had the fork in my hand, and when I tried to put it back on the plate, I realized my arm was not working properly. `` I looked down and saw a hole in my forearm about the size of a dime,'' she said. `` There was no blood, just a hole. I felt like I was part of a Salvador Dali painting.'' Police said the bullet went through a screen, a window, and a Venetian blind before it struck Ms. Downward in the right forearm. It was traveling on a level trajectory, which perplexes investigators because there are n't any buildings nearby where a gunman could have fired a level shot into the window. `` We have no idea where this bullet came from,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirchner </PERSON>. `` If you look out, the only thing in that area that's really tall is the Arco burn-off tower'' two miles away. There were n't any shooting reports that coincided with the incident, <PERSON> Kirchner </PERSON> said. Ms. Downward said police initially thought the bullet came from a high-powered rifle, but later said it may have from another kind of gun. Doctors have n't removed the slug for fear of causing more damage to her arm. `` If the doctors ever decide to remove the bullet, we can run ballistics on it,'' <PERSON> Kirchner </PERSON> said. `` Then, one day, a gun could turn up and we could match it.''

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of East Germans escaped into <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> on Saturday by storming a border gate that had been opened for a picnic celebrating <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> unity, officials said. The East Germans pushed through the gate as it was being opened and as Hungarian border guards were preparing to stamp the papers of participants in the event, the <ORGANIZATION> Austrian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Police said only that hundreds of East Germans who were not supposed to participate in the event pushed through the gate that is normally closed. The <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said up to 300 East Germans pushed through initially, and a total of 500 crossed into <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> during the day while the gate remained open. In <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, the Hungarian <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the border guards could only have stopped the East Germans from crossing by using weapons, said the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION>. However, `` they decided not to use weapons or force,'' <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said in a brief dispatch. The event called for participants to cross the border into <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, return with Austrian guests, and then picnic in a formerly restricted Hungarian zone. The restrictions were lifted Aug. 1. The event was sponsored by <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s foremost Communist reformer, <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Hapsburg </PERSON>, a West German member of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and one-time heir to the former Austro-Hungarian monarchy. He is a leader of the Austrian branch of the <LOCATION> Pan-Europa </LOCATION> movement, a private group promoting European unity. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, one of the most liberal countries in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc, in May began dismantling the barbed wire fencing and electrical warning devices on its border with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. At least 1,600 East Germans are estimated to have crossed illegally into <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> since then. Once in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, they seek documents from the West German Embassy in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> for travel to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. According to West German law, all East Germans have a right to West German passports. Some refugees say they are seeking political freedom, and others are fleeing poor economic conditions in their Communist homeland. West German diplomats have been issuing West German passports to East Germans in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, and witnesses said many of the East Germans who fled Saturday already held West German passports. About 300 East Germans have sought refuge at West German diplomatic missions in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> closed its embassy and consulate in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> on Monday, citing the inability of its diplomats to deal with the stream of East Germans wanting to flee to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> and seeking asylum on West German diplomatic property. The West German mission in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> was closed two weeks ago after 131 East Germans seeking guarantees that they can go to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> sought refuge there. Another 500 East Germans are living in a tent city set up in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, and opposition figures estimate that several hundred more have overstayed their visas and gone underground.

 Heavy rain unleashed mudslides that buried a car, temporarily trapped eight others and caused flooding that chased 55 tourists from their rented cabin, park officials said Saturday. The mudslides took place about 8 p.m. Friday on a stretch of road below slopes denuded by the huge forest fires that swept the park in the summer of 1988. One car was buried, but its occupants escaped uninjured, said park spokeswoman <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON>. Eight vehicles were stranded for about 2 -LCB- hours in <PERSON> Gibbon </PERSON> <PERSON> Canyon </PERSON> after 13 mudslides took place, the spokeswoman said. They were on a stretch of road 15 to 25 miles inside the park from the west entrance that was hit by mudslides earlier this month. Thunderstorms that dumped up to 4 inches of rain on the park sent water 3 feet deep through a cluster of cabins in the Mammoth area near the north entrance, forcing evacuation of 55 guests, Ms. <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON> said. No one was injured in either incident. Workers expected to have the road cleared by Sunday, but considered keeping it closed to traffic as a precaution, the spokeswoman said.

 Representatives from <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s new military government and the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday night began talks aimed at ending their 6-year-old civil war. The talks are the first between the rebels and the government of Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Bashir </PERSON>, who seized power in a June 30 coup. Representatives of both sides spoke with reporters before beginning the closed-door talks. Col. <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalifa </PERSON>, leader of the Sudanese government delegation, said his team came to talks aiming to `` to arrive at a final and mutually acceptable settlement through sincere and constructive dialogue.'' <PERSON> Lam </PERSON> <PERSON> Akol </PERSON>, who headed the rebel delegation, said the guerrillas had `` come here to hear with an open mind the proposals by the government to solve the problem in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Akol </PERSON> is a member of the rebel high command. The talks come five days after a speech by rebel leader <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garang </PERSON> in which he threatened to use a popular uprising to overthrow the new military government unless it stepped down and opened the way for a direct election. <PERSON> Garang </PERSON> also demanded the release of political prisoners and the lifting of a ban on political parties that <PERSON> el-Bashir </PERSON> imposed after the coup. Following the speech, <PERSON> Khalifa </PERSON> was quoted as saying <PERSON> Garang </PERSON>'s statement would not affect the peace talks and underlining the government's resolve not to `` pursue a course of action and reaction. After seizing power, <PERSON> El-Bashir </PERSON> said one of his first priorities would be to find a peaceful solution to the civil war. But he scrapped a tentative peace accord signed in November by the rebels. <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s northern government is Arab-leaning and Moslem donminated; the rebels come from the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> and ethnically African south. The guerrillas took up arms in 1983 seeking greater autonomy and economic and administrative reforms for the south. Hundreds of thousands of southern Sudanese have died during the war, primarily of famine.

 Helicopter pilot <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Graves </PERSON> says he feared prison guards would kill him when two inmates' wives commandeered his chopper and forced him to land at the <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> Correctional Facility. `` Imagine what it feels like to be flying, and all at once you have two pistols on your head, and they tell you that you're going to land at a prison ... your biggest fear is being shot by the prison guards,'' <PERSON> Graves </PERSON> told reporters Friday. `` You do n't know if they're going to let you get out of there alive. You figure once you land they're going to kill you,'' <PERSON> Graves </PERSON> said. Authorities said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON>, 41, and <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 26, ordered Graves to pluck their husbands from the prison yard. The four later transferred to a van and drove as far as <LOCATION> Holdrege </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, about 400 miles away, where they were captured after a shootout with authorities. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Pence </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> office, said Graves is not a suspect in the escape attempt. <PERSON> Graves </PERSON> said he filled in on the flight for another pilot who canceled the night before. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> interviewed Graves for three hours for any information he might have about who was involved in the escape and where the foursome was headed, Pence said. Pence said the women could be charged with air piracy, a federal crime. The women had reserved a 1969 Bell 206-A helicopter from <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Centennial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, telling company officials they wanted to take photographs of real estate. The women were picket up at La Junta. `` They pulled out the guns after we were in the air for 10 minutes, and they said, ` You're going to land in that prison,''' <PERSON> Graves </PERSON> said. After plucking <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 30, and cellmate <PERSON> Freddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON>, 21, from the prison yard, <PERSON> Graves </PERSON> flew the helicopter out and landed about 30 miles north of <LOCATION> Ordway </LOCATION>, near an abandoned farmhouse along <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> Highway 71. The escapees tied Graves up and put him face down in a shed, with a handkerchief protecting his face from the dirt, <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON> <PERSON> Yowell </PERSON> said. It took Graves about half an hour to cut himself free with a pocket knife, <PERSON> Yowell </PERSON> said. Searchers in another helicopter spotted him waving the handkerchief at them. Graves had been flying for Helicopter Airways for about three months after a five-year Army stint. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Meisinger </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, said a woman identifying herself as <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> contacted him Aug. 10 about renting the helicopter to take her and another woman to see real estate near La Junta. <PERSON> Meisinger </PERSON> said he scheduled to pick up the women on Wednesday, but he scrapped the flight because of bad weather and rescheduled it for Friday morning. <PERSON> Graves </PERSON> said he was awakened at 6 a.m. to fill in for another pilot who canceled the night before.

 Prisoners at the <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facility </ORGANIZATION> cheered when a helicopter swooped over the prison's baseball diamond and plucked up two inmates. Since then, the medium-security prison has been buzzing with talk of the short-lived escape and surprise at the unlikely pair of inmates that tried it. `` They're talking about it _ ` Just like the movies,' ` It was cool,''' said inmate <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON>, serving a life sentence for the murder of a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> police officer. `` Most of these guys are happy to see -LRB- prison officials -RRB- get beat. They're happy to see someone leave, escape, whatever. It added a little drama.'' Cellmates <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Freddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON>, no relation to <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON>, sprinted and dove into the chopper when it came down into the prison yard Friday morning. There were few inmates in the yard at the time. The men and their wives, who authorities say had hijacked the helicopter, later transferred to a van and drove as far as <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, where they were captured Friday evening in a shootout with police. One fugitive was slightly wounded. <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON>; his wife, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON>, 41; <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>; and his wife, <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON>, 26; were being held Saturday in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> was described as a onetime prison volunteer who met <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> during the course of her service and married him by proxy. Prison Superintendent <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON>, who watched the escape from the bulletproof-glass window of his office, said he was surprised <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> would have attempted it. `` When I looked at their time and their crime, I have a difficult time understanding what's going on,'' said <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON>. He said he `` would expect that from a much more desperado-type of inmate. The one guy -LRB- <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> -RRB- was serving 12 years and the other guy -LRB- <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> -RRB- four years.'' The escapees were described as an unlikely duo _ a 21-year-old with only one major crime on his record and a 30-year-old with a dozen years of serious offenses. <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> had minor brushes with the law in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION> until an armed robbery last year sent him to <LOCATION> Ordway </LOCATION>. He would have been eligible for parole in two years. In the robbery at a 7-Eleven store, he panicked before he got the money and took only a sandwich, authorities said. While awaiting sentencing in <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>, he tried unsuccessfully to escape. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> had been in and out of prison for a dozen years on convictions including sexual assault, theft and forgery. He also admitted to heavy cocaine use before being sent back to prison for a third time last year. He would not have been eligible for parole until 1996. Despite the festive mood at the prison Friday, some inmates worried they will suffer from tighter security measures in the wake of the escape. `` It was fun to hear and know it did happen, -LRB- but -RRB- it is just going to make things tougher in the institution,'' said <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Aversano </PERSON>, serving 10 years for theft and walking away from a halfway house. `` That's the way is usually works. Somebody screws up. It makes it tougher for everyone.''

 Two Colorado prison inmates and their wives, captured in a shootout after the women hijacked a helicopter for a daring breakout, will likely face charges in two states and federal courts, officials said Saturday. Investigators into Friday's escape from the medium-security <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> Correctional Facility near <LOCATION> Ordway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, said one of the women involved met her husband while working as a prison volunteer and married him by proxy. The escapees, <PERSON> Freddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON>, 21, and <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 30, and their wives, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON>, 41, and <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 26, surrendered Friday evening after a nine-minute gun battle in this small south-central <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> town 400 miles from the prison. `` This will be the talk of the town for a few days, but then things'll get back to normal,'' said <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>, night manager of the Dale Hotel. `` I could n't believe it,'' said <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>, who watched the gunfight and capture from the roof of his six-story hotel. `` It was like watching a TV movie. I know that other people were watching from their windows, too. We have n't had anything like this in town for years.'' <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kautzky </PERSON> said the foursome likely will face federal charges of air piracy, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> charges, and then extradition proceedings for likely charges in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. Three of the four were being held in separate jails Saturday. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> underwent surgery for a bullet wound to the finger and was being held at <ORGANIZATION> Good </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Samaritan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kearney </LOCATION>. Authorities in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> say the women comandeered the helicopter after hiring it from <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> says the helicopter pilot, <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Graves </PERSON>, is not a suspect in the escape. After the escape, the four abandoned the 1969 Bell 206-A helicopter and transferred to the rented van. Graves, who was tied up and left in a shed, managed to cut himself free with a pocket knife and was found by searchers. `` They pulled out the guns after we were in the air for 10 minutes, and they said, ` You're going to land in that prison,''' <PERSON> Graves </PERSON> said later. <PERSON> Graves </PERSON> said his biggest fear was that he would be shot by prison guards; prison officials said Friday that the guards held their fire during the escape in part because of fear for the pilot's safety. <PERSON> Kautzky </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> worked as a volunteer at the <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> prison in <LOCATION> Ordway </LOCATION> and at the Fremont Correctional Facility in <LOCATION> Canon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where she met her husband, <PERSON> Freddie </PERSON>, before he was moved to <LOCATION> Ordway </LOCATION>. She was also working on a degree from <ORGANIZATION> Regis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, he said. `` Under Colorado law, you can get married by proxy and that's apparently what they did,'' he said He did not know when there were married, or what her duties as a volunteer were. The <ORGANIZATION> Regis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> switchboard operator says no one is available this weekend to provide information about students or confirm <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> was enrolled. <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON>' father, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON>, said his son married <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> three months ago. The elder <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION>, said Ms. <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> visited his son every Friday and Saturday at the <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> prison. `` I hope they did catch him because I do n't want him to get in any trouble. God, he's the only son I've got,'' the father said as he watched news of his son's capture on television Friday night. <LOCATION> Holdrege </LOCATION> police officers and <LOCATION> Phelps </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's deputies fired on the van during the chase that covered roughly an eight-square block area of this town of 5,600. The four were set to be arraigned Monday, although <LOCATION> Phelps </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said Saturday he is still pondering charges. They federal and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> charges, he said, would come `` only after were through with them'' in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. He added that he was strongly considering filing attempted murder charges for the shooting at police Sgt. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Rust </PERSON>, who had bullets lodged in the air cleaner and the dashboard of his car. `` That one in the dashboard was only inches from going all the way through, and it would have gone all the way through Rust,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. Rust used his police car to ram the van twice. That action is credited with slowing the vehicle moments before Police Chief <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, positioned near his pickup truck, placed four shots through the windshield of the suspects' van. `` I think they were surprised to see me there,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a veteran of the <ORGANIZATION> Lancaster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s nine-member force recently received approval for the purchase of two semi-automatic weapons. `` We definitely could have ended this a lot sooner with one of those,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` But people criticized my background in <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION>, a city of 200,000, and said we'd never need them in <LOCATION> Holdrege </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` You know the old saying ... never say never,'' he added with a grin. <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> was serving a four-year sentence for robbery and would have been eligible for parole in September 1991. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was sentenced for sexual assault, theft and criminal impersonation in a bad check charge; his parole eligibility date was October 1996.

 Drug lords declared they would keep killing government officials following the assassination of leading presidential hopeful <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>. Tens of thousands of mourners on Saturday flocked to <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>'s coffin. `` Now the fight is with blood,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION> in a brief communique broadcast by the <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION> radio network and printed by the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>. The cartel, the world's largest cocaine ring, is believed responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We do want peace. We have screamed for it, but we will not beg for it,'' the statement said. It was signed `` The Extraditables,'' a reference to the traffickers likely to be extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The statement did not specifically claim responsibility for <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>'s death but said the group would keep killing officials. Police blamed the drug lords, who had offered a $ 500,000 reward for his death and had tried to kill him Aug. 5 in <PERSON> Medillin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Galan </PERSON> was shot and killed Friday in <LOCATION> Soache </LOCATION>, 12 miles from <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, as he prepared to address 10,000 people at a campaign rally. In the attack by at least seven gunmen, local councilman <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Penalosa </PERSON> was killed and at least six others wounded. The gunmen escaped. Police said Saturday they had detained three suspects but did not name them. Hours earlier, drug lords shot and killed a provincial police chief, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>. Responding to the killings, President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> on Friday announced a harsh crackdown. He said in a nationwide television and radio address he would use his powers under the nation's state of siege to re-establish a treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to extradite suspected traffickers. The state of emergency was declared in 1984 because of drug trafficking and guerrilla activity. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> threw out the extradition treaty in April 1988 on a technicality. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Saturday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is prepared to coordinate `` as expeditiously as possible'' the extradition of suspected Colombian drug dealers. `` We in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not forget that others are paying very high costs for the unchecked rampage of the international criminals trafficking in cocaine and undermining the lives of law-abiding citizens,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a statement issued from <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where he is vacationing. Barco consistently has refused to negotiate with the drug lords, who have never made their demands known. In his speech, he cautioned Colombians they should be prepared `` to experience more pain and sufferings'' in what he called the `` war against the nation'' unleashed by drug rings. The government sent an elite police command to the drug-bastion city of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, and the army was placed under alert. This means the army can be called any time into action anywhere in the country. <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, 46, presidential candidate of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was leading by wide margins in opinion polls for planned presidential elections in May 1990. A journalist who later became a politician, <PERSON> Galan </PERSON> favored extraditing drug traffickers, saying it was instrumental to their defeat. Aware of threats against him, <PERSON> Galan </PERSON> wore a bullet-proof vest while attending public meetings. The vest shielded him from three bullets but a fourth killed him, according to a forensic As news of <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>'s death spread through the country, crowds estimated at hundreds of thousands came out on the streets shouting `` justice, justice,'' and demanding action against the drug cartels. <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>'s body was carried to the national capital building in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> accompanied by tens of thousands of mourners, many with tears in ther eyes. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> and his top ministers appeared to pay their respects to the candidate's family. `` Galan lives in the hearts of 30 million Colombians,'' some shouted. `` Death sentence for drug traffickers,'' others said. The government has decreed a three-day mourning period for <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, who will be buried Sunday. <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>, 46, police commander for <LOCATION> Antioquia </LOCATION> province where <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> is located, recently had given up his official bodyguards and asked that they instead be assigned to protect judges. He directed the local campaign against cocaine trafficking and led raids that resulted in the seizure of tons of the drug and the arrest of several dealers. At his funeral Saturday, Police General Director Gen. <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON> pledged: `` We will wipe out from our soil, now and forever, the infamous criminals involved in the stigmatizing drug trafficking activities.''

 A federal appeals court Saturday stayed the execution of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> just three days before he was to die by lethal injection for three 1974 torture-killings dubbed the `` hi-fi murders.'' A three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> issued the stay for <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, the nation's longest-standing death inmate, after failed appeals in federal and state courts and the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pardons </ORGANIZATION>' rejection of his plea for clemency on Friday. Defense attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> had been informed shortly after the order was issued at about 10 a.m. `` He was very grateful and was very relieved. He still considers this matter very solemnly,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. The three-judge panel, which had convened here for a hearing later Saturday, issued the stay based on Andrews' latest writ of habeas corpus despite a federal magistrate's Thursday recommendation that procedural rules barred the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> from hearing it. The document did not include a reason for the stay, but said a more detailed order would follow later. The order was signed by Judge <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> on behalf of fellow judges <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldock </PERSON>. Special state prosecutor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, who had gone to the federal courthouse to get the order, declined to discuss it except to say, `` I have some thoughts, but I really do n't want to make a comment at this time.'' <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Jonesboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, has been on death row for nearly 15 years for the slayings of two women and a man during a robbery of the Hi-Fi Shop in <LOCATION> Ogden </LOCATION>. Five people were forced to drink liquid drain cleaner and were then shot; two of them survived. His co-defendant, <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Selby </PERSON>, admitted he shot the victims after <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> left the store. <PERSON> Selby </PERSON> was executed in August 1987. In his writ, <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> had argued that his rights were violated at trial by inadequate defense counsel, that a judge's failed to instruct the jury it could find him guilty of a lesser offense, and that a mistrial should have been declared when a juror found a note in a restaurant during a lunch break saying, `` Hang the niggers.''

 When the list of Solidarity candidates was posted for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s historic elections for parliament two months ago the name of one top Solidarity adviser was missing. <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, among Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s closest advisers since the independent union was founded in August 1980, had declined an offer to run. Now <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, a lawyer and journalist, is poised to become <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s first non-Communist prime minister since World War II after his nomination by Communist President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> on Saturday. During the election campaign his associates wondered why <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> had turned down a political career in favor of editing <ORGANIZATION> Tygodnik </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarnosc </ORGANIZATION>, the Solidarity weekly. And now the question is why, after his apparent reluctance to enter the political arena, was <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s choice? <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> proposed two additional names to <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> on Thursday _ historian <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON>, the Solidarity floor leader in parliament, and legislator <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON>, a free union activist for 25 years. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> described the choice as `` a terrible dilemma.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said Saturday that <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON> `` deserved it for his struggle'' but was not acceptable to Communist leaders because of his years of aggressive opposition. `` <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> is the best among us, it is true. ... He deserved it,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said, but it was critical that <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> continue to lead Solidarity's parliamentary delegation. `` Thus having a general look at the whole arrangment, I decided that such a solution is best for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s selection. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> understands the two other pillars of power in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> _ the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> church and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He founded the influential Club of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligentsia </ORGANIZATION> in 1957 and served in parliament during the 1960s in a Communist-sanctioned delegation under the church's protection. <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Ambroziak </PERSON>, a lawyer who works with <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> at the Solidarity newspaper, said the nominee is an experienced negotiator who listens to a range of views and shuns hasty decisions. `` He is very close to <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> but he will be his own man,'' <PERSON> Ambroziak </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s choice was unexpected by some Solidarity leaders. `` I am very surprised because <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> was against this idea of a Soidarity-led government at this time,'' said <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Bujak </PERSON>, head of the union's <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> region. In a July 14 editorial in his newspaper, <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> warned against a hasty move by the Solidarity to take responsibility for the government and its economic problems. `` What will be good tomorrow may be fatal today,'' he wrote. Shortly after the 1980 shipyard strike broke out, which was to lead to the creation of Solidarity, <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> and <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> rushed to the port city of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> to deliver an appeal signed by more than 60 intellectuals urging authorities to find a non-violent solution. The two men became advisers to the strikers. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> was jailed during the December 1981 martial-law crackdown on Solidarity. Released after a year, <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> became <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s assistant. He participated in negotiations this spring with communist authorities that led to the restoration of Solidarity's legal status. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s links to the Catholic church are even longer. After World War II and the Communist takeover he engaged in the struggle to preserve the church's independence. He established the intellectuals club and then founded Link, a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> monthly that is still being published. He is a personal friend of Polish-born Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, and after meeting with <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> on Friday he was received by Polish Primate <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>, with whom he prayed. Although he served in parliament from 1961 to 1970 as part of the church-linked delegation, his decision not to run for parliament this year seems to have worked in his favor. `` <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> is out of the parliamentary club so he is not engaged in parliamentary intitiatives,'' said <PERSON> Bogdan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lis </PERSON>, a Solidarity senator. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s dealings with Communist legislators while he was in parliament may have made him more acceptable to party officials. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> is expected to attend a meeting Sunday of the leaders of the Solidarity union and its parliamentary delegation to plan forming a government.

<HEAD>Sheriff Suspends Two, Newspaper Report Chronicles Corruption Cover-ups</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s sheriff on Saturday pressed for the firing of two of his officers as a newspaper reported allegations that the department had suppressed investigations of mob murders and internal corruption for years. The two officers, who are accused of robbing a drug dealer, were suspended Friday after reporters sought comment from Sheriff <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Grady </PERSON> for an article on the alleged corruption published in early Sunday edition of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. The report said sheriff's officers have concealed evidence, thwarted efforts to interview witnesses and hidden their own relationships with suspects and victims in murder investigations dating back 15 years. Telephone calls from The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> to the sheriff's department for comment on the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>'s report went unanswered Saturday On Friday, Sheriff's Police Lt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 55, a 22-year veteran of the department, was suspended for his alleged participation in the 1986 robbery of a suburban drug dealer. Deputy <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Geanes </PERSON>, 39, a six-year employee of the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION>, also was suspended for alleged involvement in the scheme. <PERSON> O'Grady </PERSON> will press the county State's Attorney's office to file criminal charges against the men and will go before a merit board to seek their dismissal, spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Currie </PERSON> said Saturday. A telephone call to a residence with the listing of <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Geanes </PERSON> in south suburban <LOCATION> Calumet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> went unanswered Saturday. At the <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> residence, a man who identified himself as <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s father said the officer was not available for comment. The sheriff's department, with headquarters in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, runs the county jail and has a 500-member police force to cover the 177 square miles of unicorporated <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and forest preserve land. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, no one has been convicted of an organized crime murder in <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in more than two decades. The sheriff's department has run the investigations of most of the estimated 70 organized crime murders in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area in the last 25 years. The case in which the two men have been suspended began to unravel Feb. 2, 1987, after <PERSON> Dwayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, a street-level drug dealer and police informant, was shot twice in the head. His body was dumped in an isolated area. For 1 -LCB- years, high-ranking sheriff's officials prevented investigators from aggressively pursuing the case, the paper said, quoting unidentified sources. The allegations include accusations that <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, along with sheriff's officers and jail guards, set up a robbery and extortion ring that preyed on suburban drug dealers, the newspaper said. Rather than expose allegations that fellow officers and jail guards were suspects in the case, high-ranking sheriff's officers hid evidence and sanitized files, the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> said, citing interviews and department records. <PERSON> O'Grady </PERSON>, elected sheriff in 1986, said he first heard of the cover-up allegations in the middle of 1988. By <PERSON> O'Grady </PERSON>'s account, some high-ranking officers gave investigators the impression they should `` tread slowly'' in efforts to solve the murder. `` I was so concerned about the investigation that I let the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> know about it,'' <PERSON> O'Grady </PERSON> said. `` I was n't happy about the case then, and I'm still not happy about the case's status.'' The newspaper quoted an unidentified drug dealer as saying that four or five men who identified themselves as sheriff's police swarmed around him one night and took his money and drugs. Many of the cover-ups alleged in the article took place during the administration of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Elrod </PERSON>, county sheriff from 1970 through 1986. <PERSON> Elrod </PERSON>, who had little to do with day-to-day operations, told the newspaper he knew nothing of the corruption alleged in the article. `` I had no inkling,'' said <PERSON> Elrod </PERSON>, now a <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge.

 <LOCATION> WARSAW </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> _ President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> on Saturday nominated Solidarity activist <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> as prime minister, paving the way for a historic break in the Communist monopoly on leadership in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. A statement released by the official news agency said the president decided the new Solidarity-led coalition government was necessary to help solve <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s crippling economic problems and end widespread public discontent. `` The president thinks that the formation of such a government will be conducive to expeditiously overcoming economic difficulties ... and satisfying the needs and aspirations of Polish society,'' the <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>, or lower house of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. The Sejm speaker will receive the nomination Monday, and the assembly will meet Wednesday. Approval is virtually assured because Solidarity and its coalition partners, two minor parties, have a majority in the body. The new government will be the first in the Soviet bloc not led by Communists since Soviet dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> consolidated communist control in the late 1940s. `` I am terrified,'' <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> said in an interview on Polish state television. But `` I think ... we can do a lot, that we can release the forces in ourselves. I think that it will not be easy, but it is possible.'' A jubilant <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said: `` It is an incredible success for our struggle. But now let us see it in practice. ... This is just the beginning.'' Speaking in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> home, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who has led Solidarity since it was founded in 1980, said he now feels free to leave the world of politics to others and to devote himself entirely to union affairs. Once approved, <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> will have several weeks to form his Cabinet, which will include Solidarity, Communists and non-Comunists. Mindful of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s strategic concerns, Solidarity has said it will let the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> retain control of the ministries of defense and interior, which oversee the army and police. In addition, local governments and the court system will remain controlled by party members. Solidarity also has promised that the change will not endanger <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s participation in the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact military alliance. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, while expressing concern last week, has said it considers the formation of a government an internal Polish affair. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s nomination marks a once-inconceivable victory for the the East bloc's first free trade union, which was banned by <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> after the 1981 martial-law crackdown. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> himself was imprisoned for one year. Solidarity, whose success in June parliament elections pressured the government into the unprecedented action, immediately promised <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> its `` full support.'' `` This should produce a major breakthrough in Polish public life by doing away with the present policy of ` nomenklatura,''' the system in which only party members are appointed to most senior jobs in government and the economy, the movement said in a statement. However, some union leaders expressed apprehension about Solidarity assuming responsibility for governing so quickly after its April 17 legalization. `` I thought it would be healthier for us to have these things happening a little bit later, because in the meantime we would gain a certain experience,'' said union spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON>.'' I think it is very risky.'' Saturday's government announcement came as the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> met in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> met union members in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> was said by associates to be resting outside of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s appointment is a stunning triumph for <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, the Solidarity founder who put together the plan for a Solidarity-led coalition government with the help of minor parties once affiliated with the Communists. The government statement called <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> a `` longtime <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> activist and former <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> deputy'' as well as `` one of the leading activists'' of Solidarity and editor of its weekly newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> Tygodnik </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarnosc </ORGANIZATION>. `` In the present situation, the president sees a need to create a government enjoyin the necessary support of parliamentary floor groups and to build it on foundations of broad agreement between <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s political and social forces,'' the statement said. An earlier <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> communique announced <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s acceptance of Communist Prime Minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>'s resignation. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, approved as prime minister by the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> on Aug. 2, wanted to put together a `` grand coalition'' led by the communists but with participation of Solidarity. Instead, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> assembled his own parliamentary majority with the minor Peasant and Democratic parties and asked <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> Thursday to allow formation of a Solidarity-led government. In June legislative elections, Solidarity won nearly all seats for which it was allowed to run under an accord that also resulted in the labor movement's legalization. With that hold in the government, the opposition was able to build its parliamentary coalition to challenge the Communists. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, opening the union's meeting at Solidarity national headquarters, praised his adviser <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON>, who had been among Solidarity's three candidates for prime minister, and said <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> would continue to function as his political adviser. Some union members were wary about the communist party's reaction to the expected government changeover. `` The -LRB- party -RRB- of course will defend itself. It will begin to start provocations. For the party, the greater disorder that there is, the better, because we are appealing for calm,'' said <PERSON> Alojzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pietryk </PERSON>, head of Solidarity for the southern coal fields of <PERSON> Jastrzebie </PERSON>. Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, an old friend of <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s, smiled broadly when asked Saturday if he was satisfied with developments in his homeland. `` More or less,'' he said. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> were restrained in their coverage of the developments. In <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, the most vehement opponent of recent East bloc reforms, the Polish developments were not even reported in the media.

 Fourteen rockets hit <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> today, injuring 18 people on the 70th anniversary of the nation's independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON>, who gave the casualty figure, said the 14 rockets struck mainly residential areas across the city. Saturday is normally the first day of the working week in <LOCATION> Moslem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, with bazaars bustling and thousands of people on the streets of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. But because of the independence holiday and rumors that U.S.-backed guerrillas fighting to overthrow the Soviet-supported government were planning massive rocket attacks on the city, streets were almost empty. The government did not mark the anniversary with a ceremony, despite reports that President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> would appear at an official function. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> has been hit almost daily by rocket attacks since late June and the guerrillas have claimed responsibility for some attacks. No one claimed responsibility for Saturday's attack. The rebels say they aim for military targets, but unofficial estimates say 98 percent of the rockets have hit non-military targets including schools, homes, crowded bus stops and bazaars. One rocket today went through the roof of the home of a family in <LOCATION> Karte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parwann </LOCATION>, just blocks from the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which was closed before the Feb. 15 withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. It went through two floors, landing in the living room and showering shrapnel on a woman who suffered injuries to the back and right arm. Young boys and girls wailed hysterically and the brother of the injured woman said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was responsible for the deaths of innocent Afghans. `` They're killing us. Why are they killing us?'' he asked, refusing to give his name. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> sources say 335 people were killed and more than 900 injured in rocket attacks and a car bombing between June 25 and Aug. 12. Virtually all were civilians. The Afghan government on Thursday accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of supplying the rebels with new, more deadly rockets that explode in the air and shower small warheads over a wide area. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said the rockets, which he did not identify, had <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markings. A promised trip Friday to see pieces of the new missiles was canceled. Deputy spokesman <PERSON> Naquib </PERSON> <PERSON> Sameer </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> garrison commander had destroyed the pieces because they were too dangerous. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have promised new arms shipments to the mujahedeen but have not revealed the types of weapons. Published reports say they include cluster bombs and Spanish 120mm mortars to crater airport runways. The government's commemoration of King <PERSON> Amanullah </PERSON>'s treaty with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1919 giving <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> its independence was almost non-existent. Red, black and green Afghan flags hung limply on flagpoles in the afternoon heat and tanks were positioned at major intersections for the first time in more than a month. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> gained its independence at the end of the third Anglo-Afghan war, at a time when this rugged land-locked country was a buffer between the two superpowers of the day, czarist <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> has compared the struggle in the nation's 11-year-old civil war with the fight by <PERSON> Amanullah </PERSON> to liberate the country.

 The nomination Saturday of Solidarity's <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> as prime minister brought cheer to customers in a long line at a gasoline station `` I am really happy. We wanted <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> from the beginning. I trust Solidarity and <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> is an honest Catholic,'' said a station attendent. `` Ca n't you tell I work for Solidarity? It is great! I have been happy since the union was founded in 1980,'' said a man waiting in his car. He said he was employed by Solidarity as a driver in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, the birthplace of the free union. There was a Solidarity pennant in the car window. The next man in line was an auto mechanic from <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` What do you think of a Solidarity prime minister,'' he was asked in Polish. `` I do n't understand,'' he replied in Russian. `` What do you think of a Soilidarity prime minister,'' he was asked in Russian. `` It is very good, it is progress,'' he said, pointing to a Solidarity button stuck to the dashboard. `` Do you keep that button there when you are in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>?'' he was asked. `` Well, no,'' he replied with a grin. Others in this city, where the Soviet bloc's first independent union was established in 1980, were pleased that Communist President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> had nominated the first non-Communist to head a Polish government in four decades. `` It is very good news because we can hope that finally something will get better. It is still bad, but now all those <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> monopolies will disappear,'' said a surveyor. A high school student said, `` It takes me by surprise. The only thing that we expected is that the prime minister could not be from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> because society could not have accepted that.'' Some people expressed surprise at the choice of <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>. They said they thought Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> would have selected <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON>, the leader of the union's parliamentary delegation. `` It is good the prime minister is from Solidarity, but I expected <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> because he is better known in society,'' said an engineer. And there were those who had not heard of the momentous decision. `` I've been listening to music all night,'' said a taxi driver waiting in the gasoline line.

 A fire destroyed a plastics recycling plant Saturday, forced the evacuation of 600 people and threatened to trigger an explosion at a chemical storage center before being brought under control. Thirty-nine firefighters suffered minor injuries, including smoke inhalation and inhalation of ammonium hydroxide fumes, said city emergency management spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayo </PERSON>. An explosion at the nearby Unocal-Amsco storage and distribution center, which is filled with flammable chemicals, would have caused widespread destruction, said city Fire Superintendent <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>. Had it not been for a new sprinkler system at the center, `` there would be no Carteret,'' <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> said. The fire at the S & amp; A Plastics Recycling plant, whose owners had been cited for improperly storing flammable material, broke out at 5:20 a.m. and was declared under control four hours later, <PERSON> Mayo </PERSON> said. Firefighters kept watch over the plant's smoldering remains throughout the day. The fire also extensively damaged the neighboring <PERSON> H.F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> steel works, <PERSON> Mayo </PERSON> said. About 600 residents were evacuated from homes in a 20-block area for fear of an explosion at the chemical plant, <PERSON> Mayo </PERSON> said. They were allowed to return around 2 p.m. Cartaret, an industrial city of nearly 21,000 people, is six miles south of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, where a fire at a scrap metal and recycling company Aug. 7 damaged a stretch of Interstate 78. Plastic drums of ammonium hydroxide stored at the <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> center melted and spilled the chemical. Booms were thrown across a nearby creek to keep contaminated water from flowing into the Arthur Kill waterway. About 200 firefighters battled the blaze. A <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> boat in the Arthur Kill pumped water from the waterway to the firefighters. The sprinkler system at the Unocal plant was n't completely installed, but firefighters were able to hook pipes up to a pumper truck and spray the plant to cool it, <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> said he cited S & amp; A Plastics in 1987 for storing flammable and combustible material outside the building. He said he fined the business $ 1,200, but cut the penalty in half after the violation was addressed. Saturday's fire started outside the building in the same place where S & amp; A had been cited for storing plastics and cardboard boxes, <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> said. State and county environmental officials did n't find evidence of toxic materials at the scene, <PERSON> Mayo </PERSON> said, although the acrid smell of burning plastic wafted through the town.

 What would you swap for a 1953 <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mantle </PERSON> original? The <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 110,000 for one Saturday as the <ORGANIZATION> Topps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> emptied its archives and put 35 years worth of rare cards, proofs and pictures on the auction block. `` Collection fever is at an all-time high. There was tremendous stuff in our files which had never been seen,'' <ORGANIZATION> Topps </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Liss </PERSON> said, explaining the company's decision to hold the auction. The No. 1-priced lot involved No. 7 in <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> pinstripes, an original 1953 painting of <PERSON> Mantle </PERSON> used to create his cards for that season. The <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> had a winning bid of $ 110,000, said <PERSON> Liss </PERSON>. The painting had been expected to bring $ 50,000. The artwork for <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> from that year went for $ 80,000 to <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION>, while the <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> painting brought $ 71,000 from an unidentified bidder. `` What we really wanted was <PERSON> Mantle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> together. Our must-buys were <PERSON> Mantle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mays </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION>. The hotel chain intends to show the paintings around the country for a year, then resell then and donate the proceeds to charity, <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> said. Paintings of <ORGANIZATION> Whitey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- $ 32,000 -RRB-, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Feller </PERSON> -LRB- $ 30,000 -RRB- and <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Campanella </PERSON> -LRB- $ 15,000 -RRB- were sold to the Rarities Group of <LOCATION> Marlboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, a collectibles company. <PERSON> Liss </PERSON> said 1953 was the only year <ORGANIZATION> Topps </ORGANIZATION> used portraits instead of photos for its cards. `` I really wanted to buy them all, but we wound up as underbidder on a lot of them. It's tough to bid against <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rue </PERSON>, Rarities sports memorabilia buyer. He did take home a nice consolation prize: an autographed <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mantle </PERSON> jersey presented to the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> star when his number was retired. The price: $ 30,000. The two-day sale marks the 51st anniversary of <ORGANIZATION> Topps </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> company that helped make the bubble-gum card an American institution. The auction was intended to clear about 75 percent of the company's archival holdings and collect an estimated $ 1 million. Unique lots up for auction include other original artwork and pictures used to create the cards; uncut sheets of baseball cards containing 60 to 120 cards; and several collector's item cards with wrong team or player names. <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbrenner </PERSON>, famed for his frequent changes of managers, is responsible for several of the collector's items. Unreleased <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> team cards with managers <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> -LRB- 1980 -RRB- and <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Howser </PERSON> -LRB- 1981 -RRB- were up for bid; both managers were driven from the dugout by the boss before the season started. In addition, there is correspondence between <ORGANIZATION> Topps </ORGANIZATION> and recent Hall of Fame inductees <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Bench </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Yastrzemski </PERSON> about their cards, and <ORGANIZATION> Topps </ORGANIZATION> card contracts signed by <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mantle </PERSON>. Strips of 60 cards went for anywhere from $ 250 to $ 2,750 in early bidding among an unusual auction crowd which opted for T-shirts and baseball caps rather than suits or ties. Several in the crowd chomped hot dogs during the bidding, which was done in a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> gym. `` This is my first one of these,'' said <PERSON> Dom </PERSON> <PERSON> Fallucci </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, a card collector who was stunned by the escalating prices. `` I bid on one card, and then it went to $ 500, then $ 600. I put my hand back in my pocket,'' <PERSON> Fallucci </PERSON> said. He left the auction with `` the donut hole _ zero. I got a bagel and coffee down the street, that's it.'' <ORGANIZATION> Topps </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to donate part of its earnings to three charities: the Children's Museum of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the Special Olympics and the Baseball Alumni Team. The auction was scheduled to continue Sunday, football and basketball card memorabilia going on the block along with pen and ink drawings from the Bazooka Joe cartoons and original artwork from `` E.T.,'' `` Star Wars'' and `` Indiana Jones'' cards.

 Historic change and daunting challenges in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> were bannered in the Western press Saturday but given decidedly less coverage in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. A grinning Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> called the developments `` a step forward.'' `` All that has been done is very important,'' the pontiff, visiting <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, said of the nomination of his friend, Solidarity activist <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, as prime minister. `` It's not easy.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> also welcomed the nomination. `` We trust that this development will help <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s progress towards democracy and result in a government which reflects the wishes and hopes of the Polish people,'' a statement said. Coverage in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> was restrained. In <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, where the government has been hostile to liberalization in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the events were not reported at all. Many Soviet newspapers carried a report from the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency quoting Polish Communist leaders as complaining about the `` confrontational actions of the leaders of the opposition.'' One of the few commentaries to appear in Soviet papers was in <LOCATION> Moskovskaya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pravda </LOCATION>, where East European specialist <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Tretyakov </PERSON> stressed the dangers of letting <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s government crisis drag on. `` The prolonging of the process of forming the government does not further social consolidation, the establishment of order and the removal of the country from its state of crisis,'' <PERSON> Tretyakov </PERSON> wrote. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency took a more positive vein: `` Government crisis enters calmer waters,'' it said. Reports in the Hungarian news media also were supportive. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> carried factual reports but no commentary on the developments in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> was the lead story in most French papers Saturday, with the pointed exception of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s L'Humanite, which put its report on page 10. An editorial in the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said `` the choice of a prime minister from Solidarity's ranks is beyond any possible contest one of the most important events since <LOCATION> Yalta </LOCATION>. But the road leading <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to democracy remains long.'' <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON>, in a front-page editorial, said a Solidarity-led government `` will have only a short honeymoon.'' Some Italian newspapers played up the role of the Catholic church. `` Close Follower of the Pope Will be Premier in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>,'' said the headline in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> L'Unita </ORGANIZATION>. In a front-page commentary in <ORGANIZATION> Corriere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Della </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milan </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Arrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> said the `` rules of behavior'' under Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> were now more evident. `` But much remains unknown: do these rules really apply for all the countries of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Not only for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, but also for <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> ... And for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>? In reality, we do n't know,'' <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s conservative <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> said gradual change was `` the only way peacefully to overcome the huge economic and political problems <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> faces.'' The Scotsman newspaper of <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION> said: `` Democratic the government might be ... but the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> still provides the bureaucracy that oils the state as well as the local government machines. In <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, the government-owned <ORGANIZATION> Al-Gomhouriya </ORGANIZATION> reported a `` historic political coup in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' and the conservative, English-language Saudi Gazette hailed `` a milestone of enormous significance.'' A front-page commentary in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>'s respected conservative daily <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presse </ORGANIZATION> said `` the situation is unstable and unpredictable, in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as well as in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` Cold and stormy autumn days could quickly follow the hot summer,'' it said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government reacted cautiously to the developments in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. `` We will continue to watch the process and will increase aid as appropriate and as we can,'' presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters at the summer <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. Asked about the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s cautious reaction, spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said, `` The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> does n't dance in the streets, I'm sorry.'' In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, Polish immigrants celebrated the news of the appontment of a Solidarity activist. But they were wary of the intentions of Communist authorities. `` From what we know of the Communists, they do n't give up power without a struggle,'' said <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Prusek </PERSON> of the Polish community on the city's northwest side.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stripped to his trousers and dove into the chilly <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> on a family dare Saturday after presenting his speedboat for a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> safety inspection. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, here for a 2 -LCB- - week vacation, netted $ 11 for the plunge and minute-long swim _ funds scraped together and presented to him by two grandchildren Later, the president's motorcade got stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic on the way home from a golf match and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hopped out to kiss a bride in a horse-drawn carriage. The president made the unexpected dive from his dock after his 28-foot speedboat, `` Fidelity,'' underwent its annual safety check. After receiving a safety inspection sticker for the boat, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made a short public service announcement filmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. `` Life jackets save lives. It's best to know before you go,'' he said. At that point, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s eldest son, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 42, dared his father to jump into the drink, a small cove off the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> that laps against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 11-acre compound at <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s Point. `` How'd you like to be on prime time television?'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked 8-year-old twins <PERSON> Jenna </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s daughters. `` Better make sure you get a life jacket,'' suggested one member of the nine-member <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auxiliary </ORGANIZATION> team that inspected <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s boat `` Do n't need a life jacket,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, plunging into the water bare-chested. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pocketed $ 11 from <PERSON> Jenna </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> and then told reporters: `` You ca n't report it unless you put something in the pot.'' When a photographer offered $ 20 if he'd jump in again, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked `` seriously?'' and began unzipping a jacket he had donned upon exiting the water. However, he did n't repeat the stunt. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the water temperature had to be over 60 degrees _ chilly by swimming standards _ but the president said it was `` a good signal for the bluefish coming in.'' The safety inspection, which is not compulsory for boat owners, includes a check of life jackets, boat horn, navigation lights and safety equipment such as flares. In advance of the inspection, presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said: `` If he flunks, there's a lot of people gon na flunk.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wore a life jacket for the public safety ad but seldom is seen wearing one on his frequent boat outings. Still dripping wet from his impromptu swim, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> posed with members of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> team and with <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> on his dock. Later, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s motorcade got caught in traffic at a checkpoint where cars are stopped before they can drive past the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> home, and the president came upon a carriage carrying newlyweds <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Sola </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Saugus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, looking a bit tired after 18 holes of gold, got out to greet the delighted couple and kiss the bride. As the couple exited the checkpoint, a presidential aide caught up with them and gave them two decks of cards and a key ring bearing the presidential seal, saying the gifts were from <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.

 Pop singer <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON>, who appeared at the <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> rock festival here 20 years ago, gave a repeat performance Saturday for about 10,000 people who came to commemorate the epic event. `` Twice in one lifetime, what more could you want?'' <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON>, 42, asked the audience during her 45-minute appearance at the farm once owned by the late <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Yasgur </PERSON>. The crowd had been waiting all week for a performance by a musician who appeared at the original Aug. 15-17, 1969, <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> Music and Art Festival, which drew more than 400,000 young people. Sporadic showers sent thousands scurrying for cover, and some left. Rain turned the original <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> into a muddy mess, but concertgoers two decades ago endured it to hear and see their idols. <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON>, whose full name is <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Safka </PERSON>, sang from a makeshift stage Saturday. She appeared the night before at a show billed as a <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> reunion concert being held at a <LOCATION> Catskill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> hotel. But the last of the three-day `` Remember Woodstock'' concerts at the resort, which featured such <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> veterans as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON>, was canceled Saturday after drawing less than 400 people in two days. `` I think she -LRB- <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> -RRB- wanted to be here because the vibes are here,'' said <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoppey </PERSON>, who was helping coordinate this weekend's entertainment at the original <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> site `` This is where it's happening,'' he said. Until <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON>'s performance, the closest thing at the original site to a 1969 performer was <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON>, father of late guitarist <PERSON> Jimi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON>. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON> appeared Friday and signed autographs, <PERSON> Hoppey </PERSON> said. An estimated 20,000 people converged on the site Friday night. The celebration has attracted old hippies, their younger counterparts, college kids and the curious. `` I'm fascinated by it,'' <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Helhowski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Milford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said as he videotaped the event. <PERSON> Helhowski </PERSON>, 55, and his wife had planned a camping vacation at <LOCATION> Swan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> months ago, unaware of its close proximity to <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tess </PERSON> <PERSON> Tenbus </PERSON>, 32, who grew up 15 miles away, was selling copies of newspaper articles detailing the events of 20 years ago. One copy, a front-page blowup of the Aug. 17, 1969, <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> was a reminder of what could happen if the rains continue. `` Hippies Mired in Sea of Mud,'' read the tabloid's headline. One thing different from the original concert, other than its size, was the overall lack of garbage. `` Everyone is picking up their trash,'' said <PERSON> Tenbus </PERSON>.

 A car loaded with fireworks accidently exploded Saturday in a supermarket parking lot, killing eight people and injuring 27 others, an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. Early reports said the explosion was a car bomb set off by Basque terrorists, but the ministry spokesman, <PERSON> Agustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Valladolid </PERSON>, said late Saturday that the car was filled with fireworks to be exploded at a wedding celebration. `` We do n't know what sparked the blast,'' <ORGANIZATION> Valladolid </ORGANIZATION> said by telephone. The explosion sent shrapnel flying and killed two people in the car, which had been on its way to a wedding, <ORGANIZATION> Valladolid </ORGANIZATION> said. All of those who died, including a 7-year-old girl and her mother, were Spaniards, he said. It was not known if any foreigners were among the wounded. Earlier, a paramilitary <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman erroneously said the explosion was a car bomb attack by the Basque separatist group <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION>, which seeks independence from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> for the three-province northern Basque region. <ORGANIZATION> Valladolid </ORGANIZATION> said the confusion arose because two men called two local newspapers just before the blast and announced that <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> would set off bombs in <LOCATION> Alicante </LOCATION>. The store is located in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, a suburb of <LOCATION> Alicante </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Alicante </LOCATION> is a major <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> summer resort.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, speaking after a rock-music performance, warned some 400,000 young people Saturday about pitfalls of materialistic life. `` Living in the permissiveness of the modern world ... it is easy and attractive to breathe this contaminated mentality and to succumb to the passing desire,'' the pontiff told youths from 55 countries. They gathered on <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gozo </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> for the 4th Vatican-sponsored World Youth Day. As the 69-year-old pontiff watched, young dancers and singers performed numbers to show that greed, selfishness and the pursuit of comfort could be unattractive. Many people in the crowd kept time with the music, waving banners and scarves. They applauded the performance by a singer in a gold lame jacket who represented selfishness. The pope's appearance and the performances were a highlight of the pontiff's three-day visit to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. He arrived Saturday and will visit the mining region of <LOCATION> Asturias </LOCATION> and the mountain shrine of <LOCATION> Covadonga </LOCATION>. On the flight from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> spoke with reporters about the nomination of Solidarity journalist <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> for prime minister of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, a personal friend of the pontiff, is expected to organize <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s first non-communist-led governmen in more than 40 years and the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> was asked if he was satisfied with developments in his homeland. `` All that has been done is very important, a step forward,'' he said. He also indicated he might go to war-ravaged <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on a mission of peace. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said he had not received a response from <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> authorities to his recent statement that he would like to visit <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> but added: `` We can say a certain interest has been shown.'' He did not elaborate but his spokesman, <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON>, said the interest had come from various foreign ministries. Last week the pontiff expressed outrage at the fighting between Lebanese Christian and Syrian-led forces and said he felt it `` imperative'' to visit the country. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s third visit to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> is part of an effort by the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> to stem the tide of secularization. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leaders also seek the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s assistance in reversing the decline in church attendance in this country, which once was a bastion of the faith. The pope, in his remarks to the young people, denounced hedonism, drug abuse, divorce, abortion and artificial birth control saying they were `` in clear contrast with the law of God.'' <PERSON> Marisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, said she came to <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gozo </LOCATION> `` to hear what the pope had to say to young people. ... I think it's excellent that young people show they're behind the holy father. Earlier in the day, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> donned a traditional brown cape and holding a pilgrim's staff, he walked along the final 300 feet of the Way of St. <PERSON> James </PERSON>. Legend has it that the body of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> washed ashore in <LOCATION> Galicia </LOCATION> in northwestern <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in a stone boat and the remains were discovered in a tomb near <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> in the 9th century.

<TEXT>
 Magazine publisher <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> celebrated his 70th birthday Saturday, welcoming nearly 1,000 guests to <LOCATION> Tangier </LOCATION>'s `` party of the century.'' Resplendent in a Forbes clan kilt, <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> stood in a receiving line shaking hands with each of his guests, many of whom were flown to <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the weekend. A fleet of buses brought the guests from their <LOCATION> Tangier </LOCATION> hotels to the <LOCATION> Mendoub </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chateau </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>' residence, and they lined up to go through security checks and draw lots for their assignments to one of six tents. At one time the line of guests extended for about 150 yards and it took some 40 minutes to pass through the gates. Hundreds of Moroccan dancers and singers entertained the guests waiting in line. Officials of the monarchy of <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> cooperated in organizing security and the city's main street was closed to all but party traffic for hours before the festivities began. Uniformed armed guards and plainclothes men were on duty early at the 15-acre garden of the chateau. The chateau, purchased in 1971 from a former royal governor of <LOCATION> Tangier </LOCATION>, is on a cliff overlooking the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> and the Straits of <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>. The midsummer haze on Saturday veiled the view of the European mainland. Most of the guests, whose names constitute a list of the wealthy and famous in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, were flown here in three jet planes, including a supersonic Concorde, from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Friday. <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> took more than 100 American and European reporters and photographers around the garden Saturday for a last-minute view of the arrangements, including six elaborately furnished tents set up for tasty Moroccan specialties, belly-dancing and fireworks, and dancing until dawn. While walking through the grounds, reporters asked <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> how he could give such a lavish party, estimated to cost more than $ 3 million, amid the poverty of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>. `` You do n't defend it,'' <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> replied. `` We probably all do things in our lives that are not essential. I do n't feel guilty about it. I feel grateful we can do it.'' His four sons and his daughter, <PERSON> Moira </PERSON>, posed for photographers with their father. Theoretically, the children were the hosts of the evening, but <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said, `` You ca n't really describe it as a surprise party. My children are giving me the party, and I'm paying for it.'' He said he had no clear idea how much it would all cost because `` the bills are not all in.'' But he said the most costly item was the three jets to fly most of the guests to <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>. `` The catering costs considerably less than it would in the West,'' he said. Catering manager <PERSON> Abdelkrim </PERSON> <PERSON> Timsamani </PERSON> said the total catering bill would come to less than $ 750,000. A total of 100 sheep, 600 chickens and 1,500 eggs went into the dishes prepared for the guests. With four exceptions, the guests had to draw lots to determine who sat in which tent. <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> assigned himself the largest tent with the other exceptions _ the two sons of <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> II and actress <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. Miss <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> appeared briefly with <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> at the end of the press viewing. She has been a frequent companion since his 39-year marriage ended in divorce in 1985.

 A <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner with 114 passengers aboard lost hydraulic power Saturday shortly after takeoff, and its pilot had to lower the landing gear by hand when it returned to <LOCATION> Lambert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, an airline official said. In other incidents, a <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet experienced a loss of oil pressure after leaving <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> and another <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> aircraft lost power in one of two engines en route to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, officials said. All three planes landed safely, as did an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet that was diverted to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> after losing one of its hydraulic systems. In <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, Flight 203 to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> made a safe landing about 30 minutes after its 9:40 a.m. takeoff, said <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>. The pilot of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 reported a loss in hydraulic power to the main landing gear, <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said. `` He manually lowered the gear, and landed routinely,'' <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said. The 114 passengers were placed on other flights. The airplane was back in service about 3 -LCB- hours later after workers replaced the hydraulic line, <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said. On Friday, a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jet returned safely to <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> after one of its engines failed. A piece of the engine fell through the roof of an auto-body shop, narrowly missing the store's manager. A <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 returned to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> after it started losing oil pressure in an engine shortly after taking off on a flight to <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, an airline spokesman said. The flight, which had 400 passengers and 14 crew members aboard, returned at 8:25 a.m., <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> said by telephone from <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, where the airline is based. A <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 757 flying from <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> landed at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after one of its two engines shut down, <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> said. Fifty-six passengers and crew were aboard the plane. An <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 flying from <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, with 83 passengers and a crew of seven aboard was diverted to <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> after the hydraulic system that controlled the plane's landing gear failed, officials said. The pilot was able to switch to a backup system, and the plane landed safely shortly after 2 p.m. The loss of the hydraulic system was caused by a valve malfunction, said airlines spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>. On July 19, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 lost its hydraulic system and its pilot was unable to use the landing gear when he brought the plane down in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Unexploded World War II Bomb Leads to Closing of Leningrad Park</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Summer Garden park of <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, lovingly laid out by <PERSON> Czar </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> the Great more than two centuries ago, has been temporarily closed because a World War II bomb has been found on its grounds, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday. The undetonated German bomb was dropped during the 900-day siege of <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> in 1941-44, the official news agency reported Saturday. The bomb lies several yards under the park's Central Alley, and was found during a search for the remains of a Nazi bomber, it said. The Germans shelled <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> with more than 100,000 high-explosive and incendiary bombs during the siege, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Some failed to detonate immediately, and chances of an explosion increase as the metal corrodes, according to <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. The bomb in the Summer Garden can not be removed, but will have to be detonated where it lies, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Ninety statues and five sculptures will be removed from the park, holes bored around the bomb and liquid nitrogen pumped into the ground to freeze the metal and contain the blast, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Sand and cement will also be piled atop the ground to contain the force of the blast, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. It said the bomb would be detonated Aug. 27, and that for the moment the Summer Garden has been closed to visitors and cordoned off by police. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> the Great laid out the Summer Garden in 1706-12, soon after he founded the new imperial capital, which he named <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>. The city was renamed <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> after the revolution that brought the Communists to power in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> in 1917.

 A congressman from President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s coalition called for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> to be phased out during a nine-year period. The lawmaker, Rep. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Venecia </PERSON>, also said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> should help this country prepare for the economic impact of closing the bases during that time. The congressman called his plan a `` middle-ground approach'' designed to satisfy growing Filipino demands for the bases to be closed while giving the Americans time to relocate the strategically important installations elsewhere in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Venecia </PERSON> outlined the idea in a resolution submitted Wednesday to this country's House of Representatives. A copy of the resolution was released Saturday. Under the proposal, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would pay the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> about $ 750 million a year for nine years. Part of the payment would go toward construction of a munitions factory for the Philippine military and a $ 150 million debt reduction plan. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Venecia </PERSON> also proposed that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> make a separate, one-time payment of $ 750 million for converting the facilities for use by civilians. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, the Subic Bay naval base and four smaller facilities under an agreement that expires in 1991. The two countries are to begin talks this year on extending the agreement. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> refuses to say whether she will support an extension. Any agreement must be approved by two-thirds of the 23-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where opposition to the bases is strong amid growing resentment of the American presence. In October, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreed to pay $ 962 million over two years to keep the bases here until 1991. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Venecia </PERSON> says his proposal is in line with a growing global trend towards demilitarization. `` The withdrawal of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military facilities from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> would thus be a part, a vital part, of a univeral process of adjustments to the requirements and challenges of the new century,'' his resolution said.

 Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> was eulogized Saturday as a martyr for the cause of world hunger, and mourners were urged to honor his memory by carrying on his work. `` <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> is gone, but his values and his work will live after him in our memory and in our commitment,'' House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said at a funeral Mass at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anne </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` We can all do something by which to remember <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> and to honor his life and work,'' the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Democrat said. `` We can commit ourselves to reward and serve those values and commitments that marked <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON>'s life and led to <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON>'s death.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, 44, was killed with 15 others Aug. 7 when their plane crashed in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> while carrying them to a camp for Sudanese refugees. A private burial is planned for the six-term <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat when his remains are returned to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, probably some time this week, according to family friends. Hundreds of people crowded under the ornately carved arches of the central <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> church Saturday and hundreds more gathered outside as politicians and clergymen praised <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s work on behalf of the starving in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and elsewhere. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Alison </PERSON>, and other family members attended the service, along with numerous dignitaries. The Mass followed Friday's memorial service, which drew 5,000 people Bishop <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiorenza </PERSON> of the Diocese of <LOCATION> Galveston-Houston </LOCATION> read a message delivered through the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, the message said, `` is well aware of Representative <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s great humanitarian effort to relieve the starvation of the Sudanese refugees in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. His holiness is likewise grateful that his admirable concern helped to bring the plight of these unfortunate people to the world's attention.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spoke forcefully during a service that mixed the elements of a traditional Roman Catholic Mass with jubilant gospel singing and the jazzy strains of a saxophone and electric bass. There were shouts of `` Amen!'' and bursts of applause throughout the Mass, and the crowd once roared to its feet when <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> asked them to applaud the late congressman. `` Mickey is not in that box,'' he said, motioning toward an empty coffin, `` just as <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> was not in that tomb. `` And because <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> is not in that box and because <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> is not in that tomb, death has not freed us of the burden of <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON>'s mission,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said `` The challenge that we have today ... is for those of us who remain to protect the integrity of <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON>'s mission. <PERSON> Jakcson </PERSON> eulogized <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> again in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> at a `` family reunion'' of blacks from <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. The event was one of five held across the country over the weekend to emphasize unity among blacks. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told a crowd estimated at 125,000 that <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> went back to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> `` again and again and again, until <PERSON> God </PERSON> called him home,. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> died feeding the hungry and rebuilding bridges between <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, D-Calif., said <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> was a `` beloved member'' of a small family _ the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> _ and spoke solemnly of its loss `` Along with <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> we lived in a world of words. Where words have great significance, where words have great power, where words even have the implications of life and death,'' <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON> said. `` Yet, at this moment, words are so incredibly inadequate to communicate to all of you here this incredible loss for an extraordinary member of our family.'' <PERSON> Fiorenza </PERSON>, a longtime friend of <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s, said: `` He was driven to do this -LRB- work -RRB- at tremendous personal sacrifice and personal risk, but he was driven by their suffering and motivated by an extraordinary compassion. `` This great city has lost an illustrious son. But what is more important, every Houstonian, especially the poor, has lost a good friend.''

 <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s foreign minister met with <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> officials Saturday to discuss the plight of Western hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by pro-Iranian extremists, diplomatic sources said. The Pakistani official, <PERSON> Yaqoub </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, met with President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> after a closed-door session with his Syrian counterpart, <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharaa </PERSON>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Syrian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. It gave no details. But diplomatic sources said <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, who flew in earlier Saturday from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, briefed <PERSON> Sharaa </PERSON> on the results of his talks in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on the hostage issue. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Sharaa </PERSON> told <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> about efforts <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> had exerted on behalf of the hostages. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has 40,000 troops in Moslem regions of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> was expected to fly to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to discuss with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the results of his efforts.

While <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s new president, <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, was quoted by the official media as saying his country would work for the release of Western hostages if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> adopts more a friendly stance toward the Islamic republic. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> also told <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should pressure <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to release <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, 33, who was abducted July 28 from his home in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> commando unit. <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> is the local leader of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, is <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s proxy force in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

 Army troops searching for a band of leftist guerrillas mistakenly opened fire on a civilian defense patrol, killing nine people and wounding three, newspapers reported Saturday. The civil patrol, made up of 70 peasants, had been looking for the same guerrillas in an area near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cristobal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verapaz </LOCATION>, 170 miles north of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, when soldiers began firing Thursday, the newspaper reports quoted the survivors as saying. Defense Minister <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramajo </PERSON> said `` apparently it was an error.'' `` The army is trying to get to the bottom of this matter,'' Gen. <PERSON> Gramajo </PERSON> said. About 800,000 villagers organized into civil patrols by the army rotate shifts watching for guerrillas and at times go into the mountains to search for them. Villagers and human rights groups complain that the duty interferes with the peasants' farm work and family life. Tens of thousands of peasants were killed and more than 100,000 others fled the country in the late 1970s and early 1980s during an army campaign to eliminate the rebel movement, which has been fighting 29 years against military and military-backed governments.

 At least 51 people were killed in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s ethnic warfare in a two-day period, and the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> advised <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> citizens working in some areas to leave the country. Military officials said Saturday that 37 of those killed since Thursday were slain in central and southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> in attacks involving Sinhalese extremists. Most of the other killings occurred in northern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, where separatists in the Tamil minority have been battling for six years for their own homeland. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has been providing funds for six agriculture and rural development projects in central <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, and a <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said the government has advised German workers at those projects to return home. <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Otto-Hallensleben </PERSON> said she did not have the number of Germans told to leave the country but the `` six projects represent around one-fifth of the number of West German projects funded in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. `` The agencies feel if the workers can not perform satisfactorily they should return ... but they will come back if the situation improves.'' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is the first country to advise its nationals to leave <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> since the ethnic conflict intensified in recent weeks. Earlier this month, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said Americans should avoid unnecessary travel to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. It is estimated that the Tamil revolt has claimed 11,000 lives, mainly in northeastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, since 1983. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> brokered a peace agreement in 1987 that called on the Tamil guerrillas to stop fighting in exchange for limited autonomy in the northeast. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> sent more than 40,000 troopers to enforce the cease-fire. But the largest Tamil guerrilla group rejected the plan.

 Police arrested 11 demonstrators Saturday and confiscated clubs, knives and shackles to prevent violence at a rally marking the second anniversary of the death of Nazi <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>. About 300 right-wing extremists and neo-Nazis gathered to mark the Aug. 17, 1987, death of <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, a deputy to <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>, who killed himself at <LOCATION> Spandau </LOCATION> prison in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> at age 93. <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> had spent more than four decades in prison and never repented his crimes after conviction at the Nuremberg trials in 1947. The late Nazi is buried in a cemetery in this Bavarian town near the border with <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, and his gravesite was presumed to be the rallying point for right-wing extremists. But police sealed off the area and arrested 11 men carrying illegal weapons or wearing Nazi-like uniforms, a police spokesman said. The others were allowed to rally. <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> politicians held a counter-rally on Friday night, and party parliamentarian <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> <PERSON> Stiegler </PERSON> told about 500 participants that `` right-wing extremists have no rights to demonstrate.''

<TEXT>
 Authorities from four European nations Saturday boarded an offshore rock' n' roll radio station in international waters on the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and forced it to close, Dutch television reported. The crackdown on Radio <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> followed complaints that the privately owned station disrupted ship-to-shore radio communications on one of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s busiest shipping lanes, according to the television report. Radio <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON>, an English-language rock station broadcasting mainly for British and Dutch listeners, was one of three stations using the <ORGANIZATION> Ross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenge </ORGANIZATION> transmitter ship anchored in international waters off the Dutch coast, the report said. Dutch, British, French and Belgian authorities went aboard the ship Saturday while Radio <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> was on the air and impounded record players and transmission equipment, the report said. Radio <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> was using the offshore transmitter to avoid restrictive media controls in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. Under maritime law, authorities do not normally have the right to board ships in international waters. The television report said authorities regarded it as legal to board the <ORGANIZATION> Ross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenge </ORGANIZATION> because the ship was n't flying a flag and could therefore be considered stateless. Included in the report was a fragment of <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caroline </ORGANIZATION>'s last broadcast, with an unidentified disc jockey saying `` It's the saddest day of my life ... Radio <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON>, we love you too much to leave you forever.''

 The Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on Saturday appealed to thousands of blacks gathered at a `` family reunion'' to register to vote and to help fight drug abuse. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who arrived here after addressing a funeral mass for Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, spoke to an estimated 125,000 people, most of them blacks, from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> at Sawyer Point Park Center. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> encouraged everyone in the crowd to register to vote, adding that blacks have died for the right to cast ballots. `` If you stand here today unregistered to vote, you're throwing a rock at their tombstones,'' said the former Democratic presidential candidate. He also made a plea for those in the crowd to enlist in the war against drugs. `` Our families are being destroyed by drugs,'' he said. `` You can not reconcile family with drugs.'' A Saturday morning parade downtown preceded the afternoon gathering. The turnout for the gathering was more than double the 50,000 expected, organizers said. The `` reunion,'' one of five held across the country to emphasize unity among blacks, offered advice on overcoming problems faced by black families and attempted to strengthen ties beyond the immediate family. `` What we have here is a vast wealth of acquired knowledge from our elders,'' said <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, a 23-year-old college student who heard <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s speech. `` We have people here that can teach and it's a crime that anyone should miss it.'' The reunion, to conclude Sunday, is the fourth of five such events across the nation this summer. Earlier reunions took place in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The last is scheduled in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for next month.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said Saturday that the 8-month-old dialogue with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is deadlocked and the stalemate could fuel the Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> told a news conference that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> adminstration insists that the Palestinians accept <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s election plan for the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> `` They want us to accept the <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> plan, which is nothing but a plot aimed at ending'' the 20-month-old uprising in the territories, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said. The lack of progress in the U.S.-PLO talks could result in the uprising becoming a `` nationwide rebellion ... and we may take another step after the rebellion,'' he said without elaboration. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan calls for the <LOCATION> Palestininans </LOCATION> to elect representatives who then would negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> some form of limited autonomy for the territories. But <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will not deal with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, saying it is a terrorist organization. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has rejected the plan, claiming it is designed to abolish Palestinian aspirations for a homeland. It also has said any elections in the territories should be held after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> withdraws and under international supervision. In December, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ended a 13-year ban on dealings with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> renounced terrorism and recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, was then authorized to open talks with the organization, and the two sides held a fourth round Monday. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> for a meeting Friday with <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> on the conflict in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> between Lebanese Christians and Syrian-led forces. There were unconfirmed reports that the three leaders agreed to press for an emergency Arab summit to discuss <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> called on the Arabs to send a peacekeeping force to stop what he called the `` slaughter and crimes against the Lebanese.'' He said <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is responsible for the latest round of violence in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, which erupted in March and has claimed more than 780 lives. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has supported anti-Arafat Palestinian groups. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was asked if he expected any foreign intervention in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and replied, `` There is a vacuum now in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and if they -LRB- the Arabs -RRB- do n't fill it, others will.''

 A minor earthquake rumbled through northwest <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and a <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> town Saturday evening, shaking houses and rattling nerves, authorities said. `` It sounded like a big explosion and then the ground shook for two or three seconds,'' police officer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Coon </PERSON> said in the northwest <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> city of Muscle Shoals, which is five miles southeast of <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>. `` You could feel it coming.'' The quake, which occurred at 7:03 p.m. and was centered 15 miles south of <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, measured 3.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, said Wavery Person, a geophysicist with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earthquake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>. Earthquakes in the area are infrequent, Person said <PERSON> Coon </PERSON> said people within a 15-mile radius of Muscle Shoals reported feeling the quake.

No injuries were reported, but police officials said they were inundated with telephone calls from worried residents. <PERSON> Coon </PERSON> said that after the quake hit, the phone began `` tearing off the wall.'' `` People said it shook their house and their windows real bad,'' he said. The quake cracked bricks on a house and caused a crack in the basement of another home in <LOCATION> Colbert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which includes Muscle Shoals, said county emergency coordinator <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. An earthquake of 3.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale can cause slight damage, and a quake of 4 on the scale can cause moderate damage.

 A longtime <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> leader won re-election Saturday to head the civil rights group's <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> chapter, making him the only state president to win office after a felony conviction, officials said. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, who is appealing a 1988 federal extortion conviction, said his winning another two-year term indicates the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancemennt of Colored People is `` ungodly proud'' of his leadership. `` Just a month ago I was re-elected to the national board of directors, and I think that's the litmus test,'' <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said. `` Of course, this test in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> was a true demonstration of the people's choice.'' <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> turned back a bid by the Rev. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Battle </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>'s Metro-Birmingham Chapter. Battle ran on a platform of bringing unity to the state chapters and of increasing membership. `` We have a lot of inactive branches,'' <PERSON> Battle </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> is at the bottom of all of the states as it relates to membership.'' Battle was defeated by an 81-35 vote of <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> delegates at the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> state convention.

 Zoos, exhibits and reptile breeders all over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> are bidding for a 20-foot python found under a home after reportedly having slithered around the neighborhood for years.

 Nothing in his 23 years as an air traffic controller for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adminstration </ORGANIZATION> prepared <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> for what he experienced July 19 when he and seven others helped guide a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 to an emergency landing in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, last month. `` I do n't know how you can ever train for a situation of this magnitude,'' said <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>, 47, the air traffic manager at <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gateway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` When you witness something like that, the emotions and so on that you go through ... you'll never forget,'' he said. Cool heads prevailed in the control tower but tensions grew as seven air traffic control personnel guided Flight 232 after it lost its hydraulic control, he said. `` The tension had run very high and, of course, the tower became very quiet'' as the disabled plane dove toward the airport, <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> said at a Friday news conference during which the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> released the tape recording of the conversation between the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> control tower and Flight 232. `` I think it kind of turned to jubilation from the standpoint that it appeared to us that Capt. <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> and his crew had got the airplane to the airport,'' he said. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> said that when the plane made a crash-landing, `` I think most of the folks up there -LRB- in the tower -RRB- were just thanking the good Lord that that airplane made it to the airport where all the emergency help was.'' Of the 296 people aboard the DC-10, 111 were killed when the plane en route from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> crashed and burst into a ball of fire. `` I know there's some tension that built right away at the point where the crew came over to us and told us about their hydraulic problems,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Zielezinski </PERSON>, area supervisor in the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> tower. `` The more people on board to help coordinate things and keep things smooth in the tower was going to be to our advantage,'' said <PERSON> Zielezinski </PERSON>, 36, who has worked as an air traffic controller for 11 years. Immediately after the landing `` there was not a controller in that tower who was not back doing his job and doing it very professionally,'' said <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>. `` At no time was there ever a sign that anyone failed to do their job,'' he said. One week after the DC-10 crash, <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> and his colleagues were faced with another emergency landing when a twin-engine turbo-prop plane owned by <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> lost its left engine. `` In light of what had happened one week to the day previous to that, the folks in the tower cab ... the adrenalin pumped a little harder. But they -LRB- the controllers -RRB- had a job to do and it was done very professionally and it had a happier ending.'' The plane landed safely. Since then, tensions in the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> control tower have subsided, <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> said. `` We're getting pretty well back to normal. What is normal after something like that happens?''

 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> released plans Friday for winter operations in <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> and said `` capabilities'' to carry out more oil-spill cleanup work will be available in the spring. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> has cleaned more shoreline miles than it anticipated last spring when its plan for cleanup of the March 24 oil spill in the sound was announced, <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s general manager in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, said at a news conference. He said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> is prepared over the winter to respond to problems and will continue scientific studies. Weather permitting, the company plans to put key scientific personnel on heavily affected beaches every two weeks during the winter so that remaining effects of oil spilled from the Exxon Valdez can be examined. The ship struck a reef in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> and spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said the level of resumed operations in the spring is unclear. The company has been under pressure from the state to make an unequivocal commitment that crews will be on the job again in 1990, but <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> has said only that it will abide by reasonable requests from the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't know what its going to look like in 1990,'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said. `` I honestly do n't know what it will look like in the spring. I think the capabilities to do things will be here, but I do n't know what we'll have to do.'' Scientific studies over the winter will `` help us to understand what we can realistically expect to find here next spring.'' Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> called <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s winter plan inadequate. The company made `` a major effort to clean oil from the surface of beaches affected by the spill, but winter efforts should be strengthened,'' he said. `` There's still a lot of oil below the surface, there's a lot of oil on the beaches and there's a lot of oil in the water,'' the governor said. `` We think that oil ought to be cleaned up as best as it can.'' <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Commissioner of Environmental Conservation <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON> described the winter plan as `` a blizzard of numbers. You can calculate numbers all day long, but that does n't get the beaches any cleaner.'' The state's proposals include continued treatment of shorelines after <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s pullout, most of which will occur by mid-September. Small, well-equipped crews could work in sheltered areas until the onset of severe weather, state officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s spill response has involved more than 13,000 people, more than 3,000 of them beach clean-up workers. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> plans to keep about 300 employees in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> during the winter, but the organization's headquarters will be moved from <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>. Six Exxon community liaison offices and seven claims offices will remain open over the winter. Demobilization began Friday. `` The first five of 1,700 container loads are on their way to <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said. `` We're in the process of moving surplus material out of the yard right now.'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s largest city is the only place with enough warehouse space for work such as the cleaning and repair of oil-containment boom. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s objective is to leave shorelines `` environmentally stable,'' but its ability to finish the job could be hampered by weather and if the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> does not approve use of the chemical compound COREXIT 9580. Critics of the compound say too little is known about its effects. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday again sought the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s permission to use the substance on heavily oiled beaches. As of Tuesday, more than 900 miles or shoreline along Prince <PERSON> Willaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> and the Gulf of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> had been treated, he said. According to <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, 80 miles along the sound and 80 miles of gulf shores still require treatment. State officials have said many of the treated beaches remain badly contaminated and need more work. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said three `` major vessels'' assigned to the spill will be withdrawn by Nov. 1. Oil-containment boom will be kept on hand in case fish hatcheries in the sound need protection, he said. Other aircraft and vessels will be stationed elsewhere in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> report released Friday criticized <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear plant operators for delaying a shutdown, despite the urging of <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> officials, when a valve failed during low-power testing. Plant operators reacted in an `` unacceptable'' way to the equipment failure, although the malfunction was not a significant safety lapse, the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> reported. It said pre-test staff training apparently was inadequate. The commission's staff also rejected a motion by <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> opponents to reopen hearings on the plant's low-power license because of the June 22 testing incident. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> attorney general's office, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> on Nuclear Pollution and the <ORGANIZATION> Seacoast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Pollution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> have asked that the license be suspended and authorization for a full-power license be withheld until a hearing can be held. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> has opposed the plant on behalf of state communities within 10 miles of the plant's safety zone. The plant stopped the tests when a steam valve malfunctioned in a non-nuclear part of the plant. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> said control room operators failed to follow procedures, waiting nearly five minutes after the part failed to shut down the plant, although an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> inspection team present urged them to do so. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>, in a report issued by its regional office in King of <LOCATION> Prussia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said the equipment failure and delayed shutdown `` did not significantly challenge the plant margin to safety. However, the operational practice exhibited by the personnel in the control room was unacceptable.'' The report said the operating staff otherwise performed well and it called control room supervisors `` highly competent individuals.'' In an 81-page report sent to the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> top executive <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> in July, plant officials admitted they initially underestimated the seriousness of the incident. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said in a statement Friday that his earlier report was consistent with the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s findings. He reiterated that plant officials accept full responsibility for `` unacceptable and inappropriate personnel performance.'' He said the plant management has taken `` major corrective actions'' since the incident. One <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> executive was fired, other employees were reprimanded and some others were given new assignments after the incident. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> reported that the valve apparently was not given a final test before the low power trials began. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> scheduled two hearings to discuss the findings: a public meeting Sept. 6 at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, and a closed enforcement conference Sept. 7 at the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> office in King of <LOCATION> Prussia </LOCATION> to determine whether <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> operators violated commission regulations. The staff opinion rejected opponents' contention that stopping the low-power tests was equivalent to starting a proceeding to suspend the license, and said halting testing did not involve a fundamental flaw in <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>'s operational training or its low-power testing program. The opinion was signed by <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Reis </PERSON>, deputy assistant general counsel of the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s reactor licensing branch in <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, Md.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> late Friday denied two appeals from the nation's longest-standing death row inmate, who faces execution on Tuesday for his role in the 1974 torture-slayings of three people. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>' petition to the state's high court, which included claims that he had a biased, all-white jury, and was victimized by false testimony, was rejected by five justices as without merit. Earlier Friday, the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pardons </ORGANIZATION> refused on a vote of 2-1 to commute his sentence to life in prison, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> denied <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>' request for a stay of execution. The high court also ruled against <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>' appeal of the pardons board's denial of clemency. Barring a stay of execution from one of several still pending appeals in federal court, <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, 34, will die by injection Tuesday morning, shortly after midnight. For nearly 15 years he has been on death row. His co-defendant, <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Selby </PERSON>, was executed in August 1987. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> and <PERSON> Selby </PERSON>, both airmen at <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, were convicted of killing two women and a man during the robbery at the Ogden Hi-Fi Shop. One woman was raped by <PERSON> Selby </PERSON> before he shot the five victims in the head. Earlier Friday, pardons board Chairman H.L. <PERSON> Haun </PERSON> said he and panel member <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON> decided that although <PERSON> Selby </PERSON> fired the shots that killed the three and wounded two others, <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>' help in forcing the victims to drink a liquid drain cleaner and his knowledge they would be killed made the death sentence appropriate. The aggravating circumstances of the crime known as the `` Hi-Fi murders'' far outweighed any mitigating factors, <PERSON> Haun </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Haun </PERSON> said <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> and <PERSON> Selby </PERSON> forced their bound victims to drink the drain cleaner and when they did not die `` quickly enough'' decided to kill them. `` Mr. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> waited outside -LRB- the store -RRB- while this took place, but he left his loaded pistol for Mr. <PERSON> Selby </PERSON> to use,'' he said. `` Mr. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> knew of Mr. <PERSON> Selby </PERSON>'s intent and shared in it.'' Two men survived, including <PERSON> Orren </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, whose son was one of those killed. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> testified at <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>' and <PERSON> Selby </PERSON>'s commutation hearings and was present Friday. Defense attorneys were expected to appeal <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>'s decision to the 10th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, where they already have a pending appeal of his rejection of <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>' companion civil rights appeal. A third 10th Circuit judge arrived Friday to complete the panel needed for a hearing on the appeals set for 2 p.m. Saturday, said court clerk <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoecker </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. In the appeals, <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> contends his constitutional rights were violated by being forced to accept as a public defender an inexperienced attorney, and a judge's failure to instruct the jury it could convict <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> of second-degree murder. The appeals also raised again the argument that a mistrial should have been declared for <PERSON> Selby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> when a juror found a note bearing the words, `` Hang the niggers.''

 The man former Housing Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> once called his `` right hand'' is refusing to cooperate with congressional investigators, citing his right against self-incrimination in snubbing a subcommittee's subpoena that he testify. <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s one-time executive assistant, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee Friday that he was asserting his Fifth Amendment rights because the conduct of panel members convinced him he would not receive a fair hearing. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said attacks last month by several panel members after he failed to appear as scheduled `` made it clear that the subcommittee members have prejudged me and have no intention of affording me a fair and evenhanded hearing.'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Banoun </PERSON>, lashed out at subcommittee Chairman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, other panel members and its staff, saying in a separate letter that all had made knowingly inaccurate statements about <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> during televised hearings, which <PERSON> Banoun </PERSON> called a `` charade.''

<HEAD>Fire The Workers But Keep Them Working</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 It's nothing for which Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> can take a bow, but the gentleman's tendency to complicate once-simple matters has helped spur an innovative, creative, opportunistic industry. Oddly, the spurring was done not through any great enterprise or financial infusion by the old codger, but by bludgeoning existing businesses with such onerous paperwork burdens they had to do something or die. As a result, employee leasing is swiftly becoming one of those phenomena they call a wave of the future. It had 5,000 employees six years ago. Today, it has at least 500,000. By 1992, it probably will reach 4 million. Its fast growth can be attributed partly to the busy governmental bureaucracy, to the complicated regulations emanating from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and state offices that drive small-business people to distraction, if not madness. Faced with this reality, some businesses `` fire'' their employees. The discharged workers stay in place; they join a leasing company. The leasing company pays them. Their old company pays the leaser. In return, the leasing company processes the payroll, signs the checks, reconciles the checking account, handles the <ORGANIZATION> IFCA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> FUTA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> SUTA </ORGANIZATION> taxes and the W-2 forms, figures the insurance claims, deals with Sec. 125 benefits deductions and Section 89 and COBRA compliance and administration ... These details have been known to drive little companies out of business. They are the talk of any conference of small-business people. The small-business press anguishes over them, the common complaint being that fulfillment of all the requirements leaves no time for running a business. In this way did Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>, quite inadvertently, provide inspiration and support to the leasing industry. In effect, he created a new area of demand that demanded the abilities of a specialist, which is the employee leaser. Altogether, there are about 500 employee leasing companies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, half of them in the populous states of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Most are very small. The largest, <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staffing </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, has 400 clients and 11,000 employees in 23 states. Some have cooperative arrangements. Those in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Encino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> involve 30,000 leased workers. Typical of emerging industries, franchising is a factor. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, Action chairman, looks for growth not just from frustrated business people who want to rid themselves of paperwork but from what he views as a trend to greater entrepreneurship. `` There's been a direct correlation between our growth and the phenomenal increase of small business during the 1980s,'' he says. The early 1980s recession drove many people to try their hand at business. More recently, he says, corporate downsizing, with resulting layoffs, has spurred activity. While the industry views the four million businesses of fewer than 50 workers as its prime market, it might eventually target larger companies also. `` There are administrative nightmares for larger companies too,'' says <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, whose customers have included divisions of <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION>, Ramada and Greyhound. Among the nightmares are regulations and compliance that differ state to state. Those federal regulations, however, are the big factor. For example, COBRA, the Consolidated Omininbus Budget Reconciliation Act that says terminated workers may continue their health insurance; and <ORGANIZATION> IRCA </ORGANIZATION>, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which creates new legal obligations for employers. One of the very toughest is Section 89 of the 1989 tax act, which compels corporations to prove they are conferring benefits equally on all employees. Ask a small-business person about that one and you'll receive more than a bland response. Some prefer to pay the penalties rather than fill out forms. It often takes a specialist _ more accurately, a firm of many specialists in different areas _ to handle such burdens. Small business especially, and some big ones too, say they have better things to do with time and manpower. Such as surviving.

<HEAD>Gay Atlantans Emerging as Political Force</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> has long been a magnet for homosexuals in the Southeast who felt they'd never be accepted in smaller towns. `` It's a little island of enlightenment in a sea of bigotry,'' said <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, a lobbyist for several <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> gay groups. They've never been forced to take to the streets to fight for equality here, but with an estimated 300,000 homosexuals in the metropolitan area, the gay community has become a well-organized, potent political force. Nowhere has that been more apparent than in the race to succeed Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. `` I think gay and lesbian people here are becoming a real political power, probably getting close to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, administrator of the Atlanta Gay Center. <ORGANIZATION> Fulton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON> and former Mayor <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the two leading Democratic candidates in the Oct. 3 election until <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON> dropped out this month, vigorously campaigned in the gay community. Both had detailed platforms on gay issues, promising to seek funds for housing for people with AIDS, to appoint gay men and lesbians to city posts and to establish police task forces to combat unprovoked assaults on homosexuals. The city's gay population has never before been courted so openly, said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Laymon </PERSON>, executive secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gay </ORGANIZATION> and Lesbian Organizations. `` We do have the numbers now. The political situation has changed. They have to pay attention.'' Even those who oppose affirmative-action programs inclusion of homosexuals agree that <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s gay population has developed some muscle. `` I think it's anti-family and it's anti-God,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON>, chairwoman of <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Awareness </ORGANIZATION>, which has fought to repeal a city ordinance amendment giving gay residents protection from discrimination. <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> has become a `` haven'' for homosexuals, she said. Unlike <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the rise of gay power here came not with a surge of militancy, but rather gradually. Gay activism surfaced in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in the early 1970s and by the time <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s homosexual population reached significant numbers much of the work had already been done `` By 1980, attitudes about equality had already changed or moderated across the country,'' <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said. `` There probably was n't a great need to get out and march. We're able to achieve much more with a lower-key approach.'' He cited <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s status as a center of the civil rights movement and its Southern gentility for the lack of confrontation over gay issues. `` A lot of gay and lesbian people tend to be from the smaller towns in the South They still have a lot of that traditional Southern mentality.'' <LOCATION> Midtown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, a hodgepodge of high-rise office towers, comfortable neighborhoods, nightclubs and shopping centers, is the center of gay life. But it's a lifestyle that has been quietly woven into the city's society. `` We're invisible,'' said <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Awareness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> GAPAC </ORGANIZATION>. `` We do n't just care about gay issues. We're interested in all of the issues that everybody else is.'' Still, many gay activists say their greatest victory was the 1986 addition of sexual orientation to an anti-discrimination ordinance. It has survived one repeal effort; CPA is trying again to have the amendment thrown out. Mrs. <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> said she does not believe a sexual preference group should be considered a minority, particularly in affirmative action programs. She does believe that heightened gay political power bodes ill for the city. `` It concerns me where the city is heading. When the morals of the city start falling apart, we will suffer the consequences,'' she said, adding that the suburbs will become conservative in reaction to gay clout within the city. Many gay men and lesbians own prosperous businesses _ with money to contribute to politicians _ and are active in one or more of the dozens of gay and lesbian organizations that rate politics high on their agenda. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign spokesman <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuster </PERSON> said the gay population is `` very important'' in building a successful coalition with <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s black majority to win a citywide election. And many politicians no longer fear a backlash if they openly support gay issues. `` Although there is a lot of homophobia, it has lessened considerably,'' he said. <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON> recently reached out for the gay vote with a proposal to include gay-owned businesses in a study of <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s affirmative action program <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Hough </PERSON>, a specialist in Southern politics at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said the proposal shows the role gay voters _ especially white ones _ play in predominantly black <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` By appealing to the margins, to the single-issue groups, you can solidify your white support,'' he said. `` In a close race, it can make a big difference.'' The prominence of gay issues in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> shows the differences between city and country in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, where no gubernatorial candidates mention gay rights as an important platform plank, he said. `` Anyone who had ambitions of statewide office in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> ... would downplay gay rights issues in any race.'' <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said gay men and lesbians have simply become part of the fabric of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, coming of age along with the fast-growing city. `` A high percentage of the gay people in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> now have 15-plus years of being involved in the community. All that is paying off now.''

<HEAD>Confusing Week For Wall Streeters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Signs of economic strength are keeping the stock market in a state of unease and leaving the much-awaited new record high for the Dow Jones industrial average out of reach. The forecast throughout Wall Street in July was that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would move more aggressively to ease credit conditions to head off a possible recession. Revised forecasts now point to the likelihood that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will not relax its credit policy and that interest rates, which have fallen substantially, could stabilize. July statistics on industrial production, homebuilding and retail sales released recently suggested a modest revival in economic activity. Although the upward blips in the data were not extraordinary they were enough to wipe out the two previous months of declines, analysts said. Views of an economic revival were further substantiated on Friday with the release of July consumer price inflation. The Labor Department's Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 percent, but excluding the two most volatile components _ food and energy _ the index was up 0.4 percent. The report produced mixed reaction among economists as to whether the numbers meant inflation is building or receding and helped add to the market's confusion. `` We do not think the inflation picture is worsening,'' said economist <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> DRI-McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, forecasting company. `` We believe the situation has stabilized and probably will improve some.'' But economist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Solloway </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said taken together the latest reports do not suggest an easing of inflationary pressures. `` The inflation number is not all that good. We could well see the overall inflation rate heading higher,'' he said. The market began the week on a cautious note. Sellers were n't aggressive and buyers refrained from participating, reflecting investor indecision about which way the market would go Their unease was compounded by the failure of the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average to decisively pierce its all-time high of 2,722.42 reached Aug. 25, 1987, despite flirting with a record breaking rise earlier this month. Less than two months after the 1987 peak, the market tumbled in the worst panic of history. `` In the backs of their minds was the 1987 stock market crash,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON>, manager of market analysis at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` They're not going to get caught in the same scenario as 1987.'' With the market drifting early in the week but refusing to move down too dramatically, many participants remained sidelined, unable to find what they considered bargains. Volume was light in contrast to the previous week's activity in which about 1 billion shares traded hands in the busiest week in more than a year. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 148.84 million shares a day, down from 200.81 million a day in the previous week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up to 2,687.97, a gain of 3.98 points on the week. The average had climbed 30.54 points in the previous week. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> stock Exchange composite index advanced 0.37 to 192.64; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market inched .51 lower to 461.97, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> value index declined 1.46 to 379.18. While improved economic growth would usually be good for stock prices, analysts said investors remained captives of the bond market. Interest rates were foremost in the minds of bondholders, who bid prices down much of the week. `` What the data shows is that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has gone as far as it's going to go for the time being - the next two to four weeks,'' said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, senior vice president, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` There's too much life left in this economy so the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> wo n't lower interest rates.

<HEAD>How Safe Is A Bond After A Takeover? New Service May Tell</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Corporate bonds are supposed to be a relatively safe investment, but how secure are they if the company that issued them is hit by a hostile takeover? That's the kind of information a credit-rating company hopes to make available to investors though a new service. Last month, <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> began ranking the protection industrial bonds provide in the face of a takeover or corporate restructuring. These threats, called `` event risks'' in bond parlance, can cause bond prices to plunge. S & amp; P is evaluating the protective language in a bond's indenture, or the written agreement between a bond issuer and bond holder. It is the first such ranking by a major credit rating service. The danger to bond prices from corporate upheaval was pointed out graphically earlier this year when <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was taken over by the leveraged buyout specialist <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s bonds, once rated as high-grade investments, plummeted to the junk-bond category due to the huge amount of debt the food and tobacco company acquired through the takeover Their price soon dropped through the floor. S & amp; P's ranking of the `` protective covenants'' contained in bond indentures judges how well a bond will maintain value in the face of a sudden and dramatic decline in its rating. The rating agency devised a scale of E-1 to E-5, with bonds rated E-1 providing the most event-risk protection and those rated E-5 providing insignificant or no protection. A common type of protection, sometimes called a `` super put,'' requires the issuer to redeem a bond at face value, which is called a put, or raise the bond's interest rate if a credit-damaging event occurs. S & amp; P cautions that its ratings are not a judgment on the likelihood that a company is a candidate for a takeover or restructuring. The event risk rating is separate from S & amp; P's ratings of corporate creditworthiness. So far, S & amp; P has ranked about 25 bonds for their event-risk protection, said <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hessol </PERSON>, a managing director at the ratings agency, which is a division of <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. For bondholders, what it's found is n't encouraging Of the 25, only one received the top ranking, and the event-risk protection in many was n't found to be worth much, <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P said. The rating agency was particularly unimpressed with a common feature of covenants that triggers the protection if at least 30 percent of a company's stock is repurchased by management within a 12-month period. S & amp; P says the 30 percent repurchase threshold is too high, giving the company the latitude to significantly weaken credit quality by taking on more debt to buy back stock. The bond offering that received the top ranking was issued by <ORGANIZATION> Enron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> energy concern. It promises to increase the interest rate if the issue is downgraded for any reason by S & amp; P or <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the other major credit-rating company. S & amp; P says the reaction to its new service has been extremely favorable. `` My phone did not stop ringing for a month,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hessol </PERSON> said last week. `` We think there was a hunger for information on this subject.'' But not everyone was pleased. `` There were a small number of -LRB- bond -RRB- issuers who felt we were putting them in play or implying they were takeover targets by virtue of the fact we were evaluating their bond indentures and were n't very impressed with the value of the protection,'' she said. But `` once issuers understood what we were doing and what we were not doing, most of them were comfortable.'' <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in a recent commentary on the S & amp; P rankings, said it was surprised at the agency's low opinion of the protection provided by the super puts. But it welcomed the ratings, saying they `` should provide more and better information for use by industrial bond investors.'' <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s says it has no plans for a similar ranking of event-risk protection. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s already includes a judgment of protective language in credit ratings if it believes the bond issuer is a candidate for a ratings-damaging event, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulvaney </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s senior analyst. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s ratings are adjusted downward if it believes a company is vulnerable to event risk. `` In cases where we find indentures that have significant protection, we may assign a slightly higher rating,'' <PERSON> Mulvaney </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Government Wins and Loses In Latest Insider Trading Drama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Another chapter in the <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> insider trading epic is history, leaving a new entry on the government's felons list but a bad taste in many mouths over the heavy-handed behavior of federal prosecutors <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, a leading Wall Street strategist who bet huge sums of money on speculative takeover stocks for himself and his venerable employer <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, agreed this past week to quit and plead guilty to one felony fraud count for insider trading in <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> shares more than three years ago. At the same time, the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office, which has orchestrated an aggressive prosecution of Wall Street corruption stemming from the <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> scandal, announced without explanation that it was abandoning a probe of two other prominent traders arrested with <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> in February 1987. Those arrests, executed with extraordinary publicity by then-U.S. attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, stunned an industry unaccustomed to police raids, search warrants and handcuffs. It has since become a splotch on the prosecution career of <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, who is running for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> mayor based partly on his record of convictions in securities cases and other white collar frauds. A few months after the <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> trio was indicted, prosecutors dropped the charges because a judge would n't give them more pretrial preparation time. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said he would bring new charges soon but never did, leaving the three no opportunity to exonerate themselves. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> and his successor, <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON>, have said the government may have acted prematurely in the <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> trio arrest and prosecution, but have offered no apologies. The government's behavior in that case reflects what many defense lawyers have called a display of sloppiness and arrogance that has needlessly ruined careers and reputations in the government's anti-fraud crusade Perhaps more important, it suggested the weakness of evidence against <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> and co-defendants, <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> trader <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wigton </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> trader <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tabor </PERSON>. The case was based largely on the confessions of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, a former mergers specialist with <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON> who was implicated in fraud by <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, the notorious speculator now serving a federal prison term for insider trading. Defense lawyers have said the case against <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> boiled down to his word against <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>'s over whether the pair conspired to use inside information in the trading of Beatrice stock. So it remains unclear why <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, after maintaining innocence and with an apparently strong defense, chose to strike a deal and plead guilty this past week. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said in a resignation statement that he wanted to spare his family the publicity of a trial and that he already had subjected them, his employer and himself to an ordeal. But some lawyers have suggested he was motivated more by guilty verdicts in two other cases that also stemmed indirectly from the <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> scandal, verdicts that showed the evident willingness of juries to treat defendants in securities crimes harshly. In June, a federal jury found stock speculator <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> guilty of securities fraud in four failed takeover attempts. Last month, six securities professionals, including a friend of <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>'s, were found guilty of fraud and the much more serious charge of racketeering, which carries enormous penalties. In other business and economic news this past week: _ Government statistics suggested the economy is n't as weak as previously believed, nor is it growing rapidly enough to accelerate inflation The June trade deficit narrowed to a 4 -LCB- - year low and consumer prices rose only 0.2 percent in July _ The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> tightened its control by adopting rules aimed at quelling penny-stock scams peddled to unwitting investors over the telephone President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, nominated a key adviser on the thrift crisis, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>, to become the new <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> chairman. _ The oil industry faced a new onslaught of litigation over the March 24 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> tanker spill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> The Alaskan government contended all oil companies operating in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> were negligent in their joint responsibility to prevent spills. _ It was a bad week for Eastern airlines strikers but a good one for air passengers and <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> shareholders Eastern showed signs of strengthening its operations despite the prolonged walkout; several major airlines extended a round of fare discounting into the fall; and investor <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>'s efforts to buy <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> for more than $ 6 billion drove its stock to record levels.

<HEAD>Rally Brings Speculators Back To Copper Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>

 A two-week rally in copper futures prices has speculators anticipating a run at record highs for the third year in a row as the market shifts into its seasonal period of peak demand. Spot prices would have to rise more than 40 cents to surpass the all-time high of $ 1.6475 a pound set last December on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> but this is a market with a proven ability to outdo itself The previous record high of $ 1.46 a pound was set in December 1987. `` The market is looking at all the factors and saying the possibility is here for something serious to take place,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON>, a metal-markets analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Copper for spot delivery on the <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION> settled Friday at $ 1.2465 a pound compared with $ 1.1735 a week earlier and $ 1.13 the week before that, representing a two-week gain of about 10 percent. Prices climbed as high as $ 1.2680 on Thursday but declined Friday following news of <ORGANIZATION> Cyprus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minerals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to restart a damaged copper smelter in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> within the next two weeks. Most other commodity markets showed little change in the past week. Copper's rise is rooted in persistent supply tightness caused by labor strife at mines in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> _ two of the largest producer nations _ and by equipment failures, sabotage and transportation problems in some of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and African countries that contribute heavily to the world supply. Prices fell sharply earlier this year and had been trading in a range between $ 1.05 and $ 1.15 since mid-May. The current steep ascent began on Aug. 9, the first of seven straight days of rising prices, when it appeared Peruvian miners were ready to strike. The strike began on Monday and has not been settled. Another supportive factor is the expectation of increased demand, which typically occurs in the fall and winter as makers of copper wire and machine parts replenish their supplies. Finally, copper prices are responding to recent economic data indicating the economy is stronger than many experts had expected. The stronger the economy, the stronger the demand for copper as a component of new offices and homes.

<HEAD>Confusing Week for Wall Streeters</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Signs of economic strength are keeping the stock market in a state of unease and leaving the much-awaited new record high for the Dow Jones industrial average out of reach. The forecast throughout Wall Street in July was that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would move more aggressively to ease credit conditions to head off a possible recession. Revised forecasts now point to the likelihood that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will not relax its credit policy and that interest rates, which have fallen substantially, could stabilize. July statistics on industrial production, homebuilding and retail sales released recently suggested a modest revival in economic activity. Although the upward blips in the data were not extraordinary they were enough to wipe out the two previous months of declines, analysts said. Views of an economic revival were further substantiated on Friday with the release of July consumer price inflation. The Labor Department's Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 percent, but excluding the two most volatile components _ food and energy _ the index was up 0.4 percent. The report produced mixed reaction among economists as to whether the numbers meant inflation is building or receding and helped add to the market's confusion. `` We do not think the inflation picture is worsening,'' said economist <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> DRI-McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, forecasting company. `` We believe the situation has stabilized and probably will improve some.'' But economist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Solloway </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said taken together the latest reports do not suggest an easing of inflationary pressures. `` The inflation number is not all that good. We could well see the overall inflation rate heading higher,'' he said. The market began the week on a cautious note. Sellers were n't aggressive and buyers refrained from participating, reflecting investor indecision about which way the market would go Their unease was compounded by the failure of the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average to decisively pierce its all-time high of 2,722.42 reached Aug. 25, 1987, despite flirting with a record breaking rise earlier this month. Less than two months after the 1987 peak, the market tumbled in the worst panic of history. `` In the backs of their minds was the 1987 stock market crash,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON>, manager of market analysis at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` They're not going to get caught in the same scenario as 1987.'' With the market drifting early in the week but refusing to move down too dramatically, many participants remained sidelined, unable to find what they considered bargains. Volume was light in contrast to the previous week's activity in which about 1 billion shares traded hands in the busiest week in more than a year. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 148.84 million shares a day, down from 200.81 million a day in the previous week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up to 2,687.97, a gain of 3.98 points on the week. The average had climbed 30.54 points in the previous week. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> stock Exchange composite index advanced 0.37 to 192.64; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market inched .51 lower to 461.97, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> value index declined 1.46 to 379.18. While improved economic growth would usually be good for stock prices, analysts said investors remained captives of the bond market. Interest rates were foremost in the minds of bondholders, who bid prices down much of the week. `` What the data shows is that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has gone as far as it's going to go for the time being - the next two to four weeks,'' said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, senior vice president, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` There's too much life left in this economy so the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> wo n't lower interest rates.

<HEAD>Penny Stock Fraud: Battling the Boiler-Rooms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A man you've never met, touting a company you've never heard of tries to sell you a stock you never wanted. Sometimes it's an honest broker pushing a low-priced but high-risk legitimate stock, but often the call is from a `` boiler-room'' bank of telephones staffed by smooth-talking sales people preying on the anxieties or greed of unsophisticated buyers. `` A high pressure salesman might say if you do n't buy now, you're going to miss the boat,'' says <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferri </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> `` The only boat you're going to miss is the Titanic.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION> oversees over-the-counter stocks and the brokers who deal in them. A rising tide of fraud involving penny stocks _ inexpensive but risky securities that usually are n't traded on any stock exchanges _ has worried securities regulators and industry officials across the country. Penny stocks in themselves are n't illegal. But the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based organization of state investment regulators, calls the fraudulent sale of these securities the biggest threat facing the average investor. Three weeks ago, 14 people and two companies were charged in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with an alleged $ 10 million penny stock scam in which the companies' share prices were artificially raised before being sold at large profits. The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> alleged in a civil complaint that the companies were only shams created to peddle stock. One company's stock, first offered at 15 cents per share in 1985, rose to a high of $ 6 per share through announcements of bogus mergers and other scams that drew in millions of dollars from investors around the country. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> earlier this year, state authorities moved to revoke the license of a Denver-based penny stock brokerage, which allegedly bilked thousands of investors including an 80-year-old woman who lost about $ 30,000. Penny stock fraud is `` the fraud du jour,'' says <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuchs </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s deputy comptroller. `` Nationally the problem has become epidemic,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiatt </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> Division. While his state does n't have a lot of wealthy investors, `` a disproportionate number of customer complaints about broker dealers in our state derive from the penny stock market,'' he said. `` I would say it's rapidly coming to the forefront of our activities,'' said <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON>, chief investigator for the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Division of Corporations in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. In the 23 years he's been on the job <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> said his division had seen about six penny stock fraud cases. `` We've got that many or more pending right now, most in the last few months.'' Officials say the very nature of penny stocks makes them prone to scam artists. Trading for a few cents up to a few dollars, penny stocks usually are issued by new companies ranging from energy developers to makers of would-be wonderdrugs. They often have an untested or unevent earnings history. Because most penny stocks are not listed nationally, information about them is hard to obtain and fraudulent claims are difficult to dispute. `` Information is power and you do n't have it with penny stocks,'' said <PERSON> Ferri </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. He said unscupulous brokers offering stocks in unsolicited telephone calls known as `` cold calling'' might be pushing legitimate stocks but not for the price at which they are actually trading. The stocks are n't usually carried in newspaper stock listings and buyers have no way of knowing their real price. Another scam consists of constantly selling stock, buying it back and selling it again at increasingly higher prices, like a pyramid scheme, until the last buyers are left holding stocks that are only worth a fraction of the price they paid. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> has created a penny stock task force and recently approved rules that will make it impossible for unscrupulous brokers to conduct penny stock sales with new customers over the phone. The new rule, effective Jan. 1, requires buyers to approve the first three transactions with a new broker in writing and requires the broker to determine the buyer's financial status and the suitability of the stock purchase. <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerson </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> attorney assigned to the task force, said the agency still is compiling nationwide statistics about penny stock fraud. But she noted that in the first half of the fiscal year that will end Sept. 30, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> received 2,462 complaints about penny stock fraud compared with 1,510 for all of last year. Regulators and industry officials caution investors to be wary when considering penny stocks, especially when offered through solicited phone calls. `` Hang up on them,'' advises <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Fuchs </PERSON>. `` Investigate a company thoroughly before you commit money.'' `` I would ask for a prospectus before I bought anything,'' said <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON>. `` Consumers have to do their homework,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Ferri </PERSON>, who advised checking up on whether the broker is reputable. `` The front line in this war is the consumer and too often people get victimized because they do n't let common sense rule the moment.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, one of two former billionaire sons of wildcat oilman H.L. Hunt who is under protection from creditors, has filed a reorganization plan in bankruptcy court that would pay less than half of the $ 300 million in back taxes the government claims he owes. Meanwhile a Peruvian mining company filed a plan with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> saying it would settle for $ 90 million of the $ 132 million it lost on <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>'s failed silver speculation. The filings were on Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>'s largest creditor, previously has said it would settle for about $ 150 million, but <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>'s most recent plan would pay the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> $ 120 million _ half from the proceeds of a liquidating trust and half from earnings after he emerges from bankruptcy. All competing plans in the bankruptcy case envision selling off <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>'s assets, estimated at between $ 80 million and $ 125 million. The differences come in how the pie is split. <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>'s plan would give unsecured creditors 37 percent, or roughly $ 30 million, of the liquidating trust. `` This plan gives the unsecured creditors the biggest pot,'' Hunt attorney <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartin </PERSON> told The Dallas Morning News. `` The only issue is whether the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> will agree to the plan.'' <ORGANIZATION> Minpeco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>, which won a $ 132 million judgment against <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> and two of his brothers because of their silver dealings, filed its own plan Thursday, saying it would settle for $ 75 million to be paid over six years, plus an additional $ 15 million from <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>'s share of the proceeds from the trust. <PERSON> Minpeco </PERSON> also would pay Hunt a 3 percent management fee for acting as an adviser in the liquidation of his assets. The filing is the latest result of a split in what had once been an informal creditors committee of <LOCATION> Minpeco </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> and Manufacturers Hanover, however, dispute <PERSON> Minpeco </PERSON>'s preferential claim on the assets of <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> or <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, who also has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Because <PERSON> Minpeco </PERSON> already has been paid about $ 80 million by other silver defendants, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> and the bank claim the other damages Minpeco is owed are largely punitive damages, interest and attorneys fees and are subordinate to the claims of unsecured creditors. <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, meanwhile, has until Aug. 31 to file a reorganization plan acceptable to creditors. After than, the creditors may be allowed to file their own plan. The Hunts filed for personal bankruptcy last year after <ORGANIZATION> Minpeco </ORGANIZATION> won a lawsuit claiming it had lost money because of the brothers' attempt to corner the silver market At the time of the filing, <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, said they had assets of about $ 196.38 million and debts of $ 887 million, including the $ 300 million <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> claim. <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON>, said they had assets of $ 258.83 million to cover $ 1.2 billion in debts, including $ 600 million to the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>.
