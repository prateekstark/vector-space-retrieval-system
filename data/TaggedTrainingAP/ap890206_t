 American <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>, a well-known supporter of Nicaraguan rebels, remained in custody for drug and weapons charges Monday after a court denied his request for release on bond. The <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Alajuela </LOCATION> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Monday that it rejected <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>'s request to be released on $ 12,500 bond. Judge <PERSON> Maximo </PERSON> <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON>, head of the court issuing the ruling, refused to comment on the decision. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>, 69, has been held since he was arrested Jan. 13. Officials also said he was being investigated on charges of spying for the U.S.-backed rebels, known as the Contras. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> remained in custody a Costa Rican hospital where he was taken Jan. 24 after suffering a heart attack in his jail cell. <PERSON> Matias </PERSON> <PERSON> Quesada </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, said Monday that <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> was recuperating and in stable condition. <PERSON> Elda </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>'s attorney, claims her client is the victim of political persecution and that his arrest was unconstitutional. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> resident, has lived in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> for 20 years. He has denied any drug trafficking connections. He said in 1986 that authorities twice raided his home in unsuccessful attempts to find evidence of gun-running and drug smuggling. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> has acknowledged permitting the Contras to use his ranch property for their activities before the Iran-Contra case broke in 1986. In the case, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials sent arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for money to be sent to the Contras. Witnesses testifying before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on illegal arms shipments to the Contras have said <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>'s ranch was a way station for gun smugglers and cocaine traffickers. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> was not among 13 men indicted in Spetember in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on charges of running an illegal arms network for the Contras. Reports said <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> was granted immunity by the special prosecutor in the case. Convicted cocaine pilot <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Betzner </PERSON> has testified that <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> once met his plane when it landed on the ranch to exchange Contra arms for Colombian cocaine.

 Actress <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> has signed a divorce agreement that will end her stormy marriage to heavyweight boxing champion <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, her attorney said Monday. They plan to file for divorse in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and the divorce should be final within 45 days, said lawyer <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> <PERSON> Felder </PERSON>. A no-fault divorce _ in which both parties agree that they should be divorced _ can be obtained in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> by either husband or wife following an overnight stay in the country, said <PERSON> Felder </PERSON>. Residency requirements are more stringent in other places, he said. `` Theoretically, either one of them could go there tomorrow and get it,'' he said. However, he said, because both of them have prior commitments, the Dominican divorce will not be sought until at least 30 days from now. <PERSON> Felder </PERSON> described the agreement, which <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> signed last week and Ms. <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> signed Sunday night, this way: `` Basically, she will keep what was hers, including all of her jewelry, and he will keep what is his.'' <PERSON> Felder </PERSON> declined to discuss the settlement in detail. Asked who would get the couple's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> mansion, he said, `` She never wanted it.'' In a statement Ms. <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> released through her publicist <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>, she said she and her family would be rooting for <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> when he fights British boxer <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> on Feb. 25. She also said: `` In view of the fact that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> has honored our personal agreement not to further publicly discuss our matter, nor the terms of the agreement, I will do no less. This is the last statement I will have on our personal lives.'' Earlier Monday, <PERSON> Felder </PERSON> said he would know by the end of the week whether Ms. <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> had signed the agreement, but later in the day he acknowledged that she had signed it Sunday evening. He said he originally did n't want to confirm the agreement had been signed because of a technical glitch in the paperwork, but he later decided to confirm that Ms. <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> had signed the agreement to clear up conflicting reports. Ms. <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> appears in the TV series, `` Head of the Class.''

 Hundreds of new pupils have entered the battered classrooms of <ORGANIZATION> Pace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, signaling the rebirth of a private high school that was once a showpiece of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment in black education. When Pace opened in 1982, the $ 6-million, tan brick building gleamed like a well-endowed institution in a wealthy <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> suburb. Despite the grassy, 22-acre campus separating it from <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>'s dirt streets and shabby bungalows, the school now seems to belong to an inner-city slum. Offering commercial studies as an alternative to <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>'s rundown state schools, Pace suffered during the 1984-87 period of nationwide black unrest and school boycotts against apartheid. Militants advocating `` people's education'' tagged Pace as elitist. Politics and violence distracted the students and few passed their exams. The school closed for several months. Principals came and went, vandals invaded the building, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies that had built the school withdrew their support, the staff served without pay, and enrollment shrank. As the new term began Jan. 25, the roof leaked and the telephone did n't work. Toilets and lockers were broken. Books, chairs and teachers were scarce. Two derelict cars stood in the driveway. Weeds had grown waist-high in the tennis courts. A handwritten note taped on a classoom door recalled an extracurricular struggle: `` Do n't push us, turkeys, ` cause you'll never get away with it.'' But Pace has human assets: <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> <PERSON> Kambule </PERSON>, 68, the new principal, and <PERSON> Lekgau </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathabathe </PERSON>, 63, chairman of a new school board composed entirely of <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> residents. Both were school principals in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> in 1976, and from their schools came leaders of student riots against Afrikaans-language instruction imposed by the white-minority government. Both resigned to support the student protest, <PERSON> Kambule </PERSON> becoming a university mathematics teacher, <PERSON> Mathabathe </PERSON> joining a food-processing company. <PERSON> Kambule </PERSON> retains a reputation as an insirational teacher who gets results, and his arrival at Pace in mid-1988 was particularly welcomed by Sowetans. `` Parents have confidence. Children started coming back from private schools in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kambule </PERSON> said in an interview. `` I'm budgeting for the full number of 600 students and I've had to send hundreds away.'' Some of Pace's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporate backers have divested and left <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, but those that remain are showing renewed interest. `` We no longer have any say in running the school but we have recommended to our members that they become involved financially again,'' said <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` One company has already appointed a fund raiser for Pace.'' Students are required to pay only half their annual fees of 3,000 rand -LRB- $ 1,250 -RRB- and company donations are expected to make up the balance. <PERSON> Mathabathe </PERSON> said Pace needs 60,000 rands -LRB- $ 25,000 -RRB- a month to stay open, and much more to renovate the building and increase salaries. The school increasingly has encouraged community involvement. Civic groups use the gymnasium, and the auditorium is rented out for church services, wedding receptions and taxi drivers' meetings. But <PERSON> Kambule </PERSON> emphasized that Pace's goal remains the same: to provide a superior education to blacks seeking middle-management business jobs. The first Pace students to take final high school exams under <PERSON> Kambule </PERSON>'s direction numbered only 55 but 31 passed, by far the best percentage of any <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> school last year. `` I'm interested in children setting out on their own for the future, through education,'' <PERSON> Kambule </PERSON> said. `` I tell them, ` Do n't call me principal, I'm your employee, I'm in your service. But there's lots of discipline.'' He appears to have ended Pace's political isolation from <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>'s young militants `` People have been asking for alternative education. I explain that this is an alternative school,'' <PERSON> Kambule </PERSON> said. `` Politics in the school are n't over. The revolution is still on. But they should n't treat us like they treat a government school.'' <PERSON> Kambule </PERSON> said he allowed a youth group to use the auditorium last year to celebrate the birthday of the imprisoned black leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. `` They came to me afterward and said, ` We did n't think you'd let us.' I replied, ` Why not? It's your school.'''

<TEXT>
 The president, the military and the Virgin of <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION> used to be off-limits for Mexican political cartoonists. Now only the generals and the Virgin are taboo. The best of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s cartoonists say what others ca n't _ or wo n't. Their razor-sharp commentaries sparkle on gray pages awash in windy pro-government prose. `` They are in the vanguard of free expression in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Monsivais </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s most outspoken, acerbic social analysts. `` They get away with things I never could.'' The political ferment of 1988, a year of unprecedented losses at the polls for the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, sparked a wave of graphic daring. More than one artist has depicted <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s diminutive, jug-eared, balding new chief executive, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, as a Disneyesque rodent named <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON>. `` They are tough, very tough,'' <PERSON> Monsivais </PERSON> said approvingly, although President <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> seems to be getting a bit more cartoon respect than he did as candidate and president-elect. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, head of the New York-based Cartoonists and <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Syndicate </ORGANIZATION>, agrees that something special is afoot. `` <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has a fantastically high number of exceptional cartoonists,'' said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, who syndicates many of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s best. `` They are high-caliber graphic artists. It makes their work very, very effective.'' <PERSON> Rogelio </PERSON> <PERSON> Naranjo </PERSON>'s razor-sharp pen has been on the cutting edge for years. Day by day, stroke by ironic stroke, <PERSON> Naranjo </PERSON> has chiseled away at the pretensions, foibles, hypocrisies and taboos that have buttressed a one-party government for 60 years. He's honed a sixth sense for what he can get away with in his 22 years of political cartooning. `` It's like a mystical thing in my work. I navigate the line that divides what is possible and what is n't,'' he said. When it comes to government policy, now `` there are very few limits.'' Government austerity programs and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s crippling foreign debt provoke some of the bitterest commentary. <PERSON> Naranjo </PERSON> resorted, literally, to gallows humor, depicting a plump man representing the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> picking the pocket of a starved, barefoot and hanged worker. <PERSON> Bulmaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Castellanos </PERSON>, who draws under the monicker Magu, showed <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, architect of an austerity pact that controlled wages and prices, as a crazed workman armed with a chainsaw standing over a bloody body skewered by the pact. The generals are another story. Both official censorship and self-censorship have a long history in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, where few care to rouse the military and endanger decades of civilian rule. `` The army is the most taboo thing,'' <PERSON> Naranjo </PERSON> said. `` Everyone assumes the army is a great power in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> that can influence the government in a radical and substantial manner.'' As for the Virgin of <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION>, even <PERSON> Naranjo </PERSON>, who has lampooned the pope, says such a revered symbol can not be used to make a point. A museum exhibit that included irreverent paintings of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s patron saint was shuttered after a public outcry Although most of their satire is directed at the ruling establishment, the cartoonists do take occasional pokes at the opposition. <PERSON> Efren </PERSON> <PERSON> Maldonado </PERSON> showed opposition leader <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> as a giant head supported by a magic carpet in the image of former President <PERSON> Lazaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON>'s father and a national hero. Cartoonists such as <PERSON> Naranjo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Helio </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> began stretching the limits of the possible as founders of the cheeky humor magazine <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Garrapata </ORGANIZATION> in 1968, a year of political upheaval in much of the world, including <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` The notion of reverence disappeared,'' <PERSON> Monsivais </PERSON> said. In a show of impatience with the one-party status quo, thousands took to the streets. The unrest lasted only a few months, until the army opened fire on a demonstration in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, killing scores. Not long after the massacre, <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrapata </PERSON> co-founder <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Rio </PERSON>, who signs himself <PERSON> Rius </PERSON>, was kidnapped by uniformed men and forced to stand next to an empty grave in front of what turned out to be a mock firing squad. Subsequent administrations began slowly opening a safety valve that included tolerance for press freedom. The Mexican chief executive was traditionally above reproach, no matter how unpopular. Even now <PERSON> Maldonado </PERSON>, the first cartoonist to put Dumbo ears on <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, insists he intends no disrepect. <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> remembers a cartoon of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Portillo </PERSON>, who left office to almost universal relief in 1982. `` He was drawn as <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON> _ but very, very handsome, very athletic,'' <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> said. With <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, cartoonists have gone far beyond making fun of his ears and his austere economics, attacking the very legitimacy of his presidency. His election was marred by accusations of fraud and <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> still claims that he won. The most audacious cartoons appear in El Universal, a mainline newspaper that gave significant space to the opposition in 1988, and in two publications born after 1968: <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jornada </ORGANIZATION>, a liberal daily, and the feisty weekly Proceso. But both <PERSON> Naranjo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, who just won his second Gran Prix from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartoon </ORGANIZATION>, say even El Universal sometimes refuses a cartoon it considers too daring. After the July 6 presidential election, which many say the ruling party rigged, <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> did a sketch portraying <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> as Dr. <PERSON> Caligari </PERSON>, the eerie protagonist of a classic silent horror film. El Universal rejected it without explanation, he said. The cartoon later ran in an opposition paper.

 The mayor of <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> has been replaced after less than a year in office, the Romanian state news agency said in a terse report that gave no reason for the personnel change. <PERSON> Constantin </PERSON> <PERSON> Radu </PERSON>, who had also headed the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the capital, `` was given other tasks,'' Agerpres reported Monday without details. <PERSON> Barbu </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrescu </PERSON>, 63, a former deputy premier, was named to replace him in both posts, the news agency said. <PERSON> Radu </PERSON>'s ouster comes at a time of widespread food and energy shortages in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s capital. But the announcement came as a surprise, Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> said, since <PERSON> Radu </PERSON> was named mayor in May. <PERSON> Radu </PERSON>, previously deputy premier for construction and investment, apparently oversaw construction in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> of a giant party headquarters and apartments for the party elite.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here is a transcript of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s news conference Monday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: Well, for more than half a century the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has operated a deposit insurance program that provides direct government protection to the savings of our citizens. This program has enabled tens of millions of Americans to save with confidence. In all the time since creation of the deposit insurance, savers have not lost one dollar of insured deposits, and I am determined that they never will. Deposit insurance has always been intended to be self-funded. And this means that the banks, the savings and loans, and credit unions that are insured pay a small amount of their assets each year into a fund that's used to protect depositors. In every case these funds are spent to protect the depositors, not the institutions that fail. For the last 20 years, conditions in our financial markets have grown steadily more complex, and a portion of the savings and loan industry has encountered steadily growing problems. These financial difficulties have led to a continuous erosion of the strength of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>. Economic conditions have played a major role in this situation. However, unconscionable risk-taking, fraud, and outright criminality have also been factors. Because of the accumulation of loses at hundreds of these thrift institutions, additional resources must be devoted to cleaning up this problem. We intend to restore our entire deposit insurance system to complete health. While the issues are complex and the difficulties manifold, we will make the hard choices, not run from them. We will see that the guarantee to depositors is forever honored, and we will see to it that the system is reformed comprehensively so that the situation is not repeated again. To do this, I am today announcing a comprehensive and wide-ranging set of proposals. The secretary of the treasury, <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, will describe these proposals to you in detail in a few minutes. However, I think it's important to summarize some of the major points. The proposals include four major elements. First, currently insolvent savings institutions will be placed under the joint management of the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>, pursuant to existing law. This will enable us to control future risk-taking and to begin reducing ongoing losses. Second, the regulatory mechanism will be substantially overhauled to enable it to more effectively limit risk-taking. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> would become the insurance agency for both banks and thrifts under this system, although there's no comingling of funds. The insurer will have the authority to set minimum standards for capital and accounting. Uniform disclosure standards will also be implemented. The chartering agency for thrifts would come under the general oversight of the secretary of the treasury. Third, we will create a financing corporation to issue $ 50 billion in bonds to finance the cost of resolving failed institutions which will supplement approximately $ 40 billion that has already been spent. All of the principal of these bonds and a portion of the interest on them will be paid from industry sources.

 However, the balance would be paid from on-budget outlays of general revenues. Hopefully, some of these revenues will be recovered in the future through sale of assets and recovery of funds from the wrongdoers. Fourth, we plan to increase the budget of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> by approximately $ 50 million to enable it to create a nationwide program to seek out and punish those that have committed wrongdoing in the management of these failed institutions. These funds will result in almost doubling the personnel devoted to the apprehension and prosecution of individuals committing fraud in our financial markets. As you can see, these proposals are based upon several overriding principles. First, I will not support any new fee on depositors. Second, we should preserve the overall federal budget structure and not allow the misdeeds and the wrongdoings of savings and loan executives and the inadequacy of their regulation to significantly alter our overall budget priorities. And third, I have concluded that this proposal, if promptly enacted, will enable our system to prevent any repetition of this situation. And fourth, I've decided to attack this problem head-on, with every available resource of our government, because it is a national problem. I've directed that the combined resources of our federal agencies be brought together in a team effort to resolve the problem. And fifth, I believe that banks and thrifts should pay the real cost of providing the deposit insurance protection. The price the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> charges banks for their insurance has not been increased since 1935. We propose to increase the bank insurance premium by less than 7 cents per $ 100 of insurance protection that they receive. Every penny collected would be used to strengthen the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> so that the taxpayers will not be called on to rescue it a few years from now. And I make you a solemn pledge that we will make every effort to recover assets diverted from these institutions and to place behind bars those who have caused losses through criminal behavior. Let those who would take advantage of the public trust and put at risk the savings of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> families anticipate that we will seek them out, pursue them, and demand the most severe penalty. In closing, I want to just say a word to the small savers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Across this great land, families and individuals work and save, and we hope to encourage even greater rates of savings to promote a brighter future for our children. Your government has stood behind the safety of insured deposits before. It does today, and it will do so at all times in the future. Every insured deposit will be backed by the full faith and credit of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, which means it will be _ that it will be absolutely protected. For the future, we will seek to achieve a safe, sound and profitable banking system. However, integrity and prudence must share an equal position with competition in our financial markets. Clean markets are an absolute prerequisite to a free economy and to the public confidence that is its most important ingredient. I've determined to face this problem squarely and to ask for your support in putting it behind us. I have ordered that the resources of the executive branch be brought to bear on cleaning up this problem. I have personally met with the leadership of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on this issue. My administration will work cooperatively with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as the legislation that we will submit in a few days' time is considered. I call on the Congress to join me in a determined effort to resolve this threat to the American financial system permanently, and to do so without delay.

 I welcome the leaders that are with me here on this platform. I think their support says a lot about the efficacy of our proposal. And now I propose to take just a few questions. On the technical aspects, I will defer to these people and then I'll be glad to turn this over to Secretary <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. I believe we start with <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> and then <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> and then get going. Q. Mr. <PERSON> Pesident </PERSON>, are you guaranteeing that the extra costs, premium increases and so forth, will not be passed on to the depositors, taxpayers? And also, what is your responsibility in this debacle? I mean the Reagan-Bush deal for deregulation of business and banking? A. On the first place, we're not guaranteeing that. I would hope that would n't happen, but there's no guarantee what the institutions will do. Secondly, there's enough to be said for everybody in this together trying to solve this problem. So I ca n't equate any personal _ I'm not inclined to go into any personal blame, simply to say that we've got to solve this problem and we're on the path to doing that. Yeah, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>. Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> votes tomorrow on that controversial pay raise plan. And the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has already voted against it. Would you sign a bill that vetoes the pay raise, not only for the members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but also for federal judges and other high officials in the government? A. I said I support it. Yes? Q. Mr. President, there is a feeling that part of this problem is attributable to deregulation of the financial industry. In retrospect, do you think that deregulation might have gone too far in the last 10 years or so? And, in the future, is your marching order to your administration to be a little more careful in regulating this particular industry? <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>, I do n't know the answer. I'd be most interested to know what our experts here feel about whether _ how much of the problem could be attributed to deregulation. I just do n't know the answer to your question. So, I ca n't reply. Yes? Q. Mr. President, you have placed considerable stress in these early days of your presidency on ethics and propriety, yet in recent days there's this controversy on Capitol Hill concerning the propriety of Senator Tower's alleged behavior, and questions raised over the weekend about the financial arrangements on the private funds of the man in charge of ethis, your counsel <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, and other questions involving members of the administration, or members-to-be of the administration. And I wonder sir, what's happened here Is it too harsh behavior on our part, too lax behavior on your part? What? A. I do n't think anything has happened. I learned long ago in public life not to make judgments based on allegations. But having said that, I want to have my administration aspire to the highest possible ethical standards. And we have appointed a commission to go out there now and try to detail what these standards should be. And we are in a new era on these matters; matters that might have been approved and looked at one way may have a different perception today. And, so, what I want to do is finalize our standards and then urge everybody in all branches of government to aspire to those standards.

<HEAD>WASHN: those standards.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 But I do think, <PERSON> Rick </PERSON>, that it's fair that we not reach judgment on <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearings before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearings are concluded, because it's very hard to filter out fact from fiction, spurious allegation from fact. And I am not about to make a judgment based on a sensationalized newspaper story. I'm simply not going to do that. That would n't be fair, and I'm not sure how ethical it would be. So let's wait and see. This _ you're referring to the Tower matter up there. That matter has been looked at by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. The committee now has that. They have the responsibility to make determination. And I'll be very interested to see what they say. But I am not going to make conclusions _ jump to conclusions based on stories that may or may not have any validity at all. Yes? Q. Mr. President, even if, as your spokesman says you do, you continue to back Senator Tower for the position, there are those, you've heard, who say that the best thing he could do for you is to step aside, because even if confirmed, he then would become `` damaged goods,'' weaker in administering, a very, very tough job on your behalf. How do you respond to that suggestion? A. Well, I think people would not want a person to step aside, given rumor, particularly if the rumor is baseless. And the process _ what _ the problem is the process is taking a little longer than I would like, and yet, I think the Senate has got to do what they're doing _ looking at these allegations very carefully. But, you know, as I said here at this same podium a while back, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are basically fair. And, if these allegations prove to be allegations without fact behind them, I think the people are going to say, `` Wait a minute. What went on here? How come it was all this _ we'd read this one day, and then kind of a puff of smoke the next?'' And, so, I do n't think, in your substantive question though, that if it proves _ if the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee gives its endorsement to the senator, particularly after all of these allegations, that there is any danger at all of damage to his credibility or his ability to do the job. Yes? Q. Mr. President, there are new and substantive allegations that Senator Tower lost control over the highly classified security documents and computer disks that were used in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> under his watch. If those allegations prove to be founded, would you then withdraw his nomination? A. I would not answer hypothetical questions of that nature. You're telling me something that I have n't heard before. And, we did have access to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> reports. So, if this matter is now before the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, let them investigate it. But, I ca n't go into a hypothesis. All I would be doing would be adding to, I think, speculation that is not helpful at this juncture. Q. But, sir, will you pursue these allegations in the executive branch? Are you going to track what the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is looking into? Are you going to personally surveil these kinds of allegations yourself? A. Every rumor and every innuendo? No. But, if you make _ if there's some substantive allegation of this nature, of course it would concern me. Yes? Q. Mr. President, back to S & amp; Ls, if we might. Millions _ -LRB- laughter -RRB- _ millions of Americans save alternatively. That is, they put their funds in mutual funds, stocks, and that kind of thing. As I read it, you've now outlined a plan that places a lot of the S & amp; L bailout on the backs of the general treasury. How fair is that? A. We've got a major problem and something has to be done. And this is the fairest system that the best minds in this administration can come up with. And, so, I'd _ I, again, would ask you to ask the specifics of the treasury burden to the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> or the secretary of the treasury. Ask how they see that.

 But, look, as I've said, there is no easy answer to this. All I want to do is make a sound proposal, work to put it into effect, and have that proposal such that the country wo n't have to face this problem again. Yes, <PERSON> Dave </PERSON>? Q. Mr. President, you said you dropped the deposit fee idea. But this plan you've given us has an increase in premimums that may be paid by consumers as well as a large amount of taxpayer's money. Is n't that the same thing _ consumers and taxpayers are still going to have to pay the price for this? A. Well, as I indicated earlier on, there is no guarantee of passing this on to the consumer, nor is there a guarantee it wo n't be passed on But this arrangement has been there since _ for 50 years. And you might argue whether it's been passed on or not, I just do n't know; I have n't seen the flow-through in the industry. But nothing is without pain when you come to solve a problem of this magnitude. Yes? Q. Mr. President, you've talked to several members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in various receptions and dinners and personal conversations over the past couple of weeks, in many of them you discussed your plan for this problem. What is your feeling for the reception that it's going to get on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and of the selling job that it will make you have to get it passed? A. We may have a big selling job. But I've been encouraged so far with the spirit epitomized by the members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, particularly at the joint leadership meeting the other day. We did n't go into every detail of this; these plans were still being formulated and I wanted to get their views. I was encouraged by what <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> told me earlier on about how he _ what he felt the receptivity of the plan will be. But I do n't think it's fair to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to say that they have signaled to me that they are going to be enthusiastic on this plan, although I hope they are. Yes? Q. Mr. President _ A. I'm going to take about three more, and then turn this over to these gentlemen here who are prepared to go into as much detail as you want. Yes? Q. Mr. President, on these allegations that surround Tower now, at least variations on the theme surfaced early in the transition _ allegations of womanizing and taking money from defense contractors, that sort of thing. Have you satisfied yourself that he is still the nominee you want? And can you give us, at this time, a wholehearted endorsement of Tower? A. Yes, I can, and I will right now, because some of the very same allegations that were floated that long ago apparently have been looked at and examined by the best possible examiners _ I'm talking about the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> _ and found to be groundless So, therefore, I'm not about to change my view. Now if somebody comes up with facts, I hope I'm not narrow-minded enough that I would n't take a look, but I am not going to deal in the kinds of rumors that I've seen reported and then knocked down, and then reported and then knocked down. Yes?

<HEAD>Barbara Bush's View of the White House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two weeks after moving into the most prestigious home in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> can not conceal her excitement. For starters, there's the collection of presidential china: `` <PERSON> Grover </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleveland </PERSON> at lunch today ... <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> yesterday. Can you believe that?'' There's more. `` The views are pretty spectacular,'' she says, noting she can gaze directly at the Oval Office from her second-floor office in the White House. `` See, I can see him right there,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says, pointing across the Rose Garden to the office occupied by her husband, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. In the <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedroom </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> shows off a felt-covered frame that contains one of only five copies of the <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION> Address. `` This is the only one signed and dated. You can read that. ... Is n't that amazing? `` The Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> man who was up here one day _ I showed it to him and he looked absolutely green.'' A canopy bed on the second-floor `` was where the four presidents before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> slept,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says as she leads a visitor on a tour of the presidential residence. `` Pretty grand, huh?'' In an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said she `` felt right at home from the very first moment.'' Her husband, she said, is `` exactly the same'' and has not changed since moving up from vice president under <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. However, she said everyone else has changed and `` everybody treats you differently when you're president.'' `` When you're vice president and certainly vice president's wife, you get away with many more things than you do when you're president,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` Everything you say becomes major and it is major. He is the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' She said her husband has an `` enormous job. ... Has he philosophized about it? No. But he's absolutely determined to do the best he can. `` I see my job as trying to take some of that pressure off him,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I see that as my job ... to try to not talk about those problems and also _ do not talk when he's working. I mean, I think that's a big part of it,'' she said. `` Because he knows with me, I hope, that he can curl up with his problems and study them and he's not going to have me badgering him about something else. `` I really do not lobby <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' his wife said. `` I do n't lobby anyone. A lot of people try to skirt regular channels and send letters intended for the president to Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in hopes she'll pass it on. `` I just do n't give them to him,'' she said. Despite the intense demands of his office, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does not seem weighed down by the job, his wife said. `` I should tell you ` yes' but no _ he sleeps like a baby,'' she said. `` Because he knows he's human. I mean, he's been around the presidency so long that I think he really feels he can do the best job that can be done.'' She said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> awakens every morning about 6 a.m. and has coffee and juice in bed while reading morning newspapers _ about five in all _ and scanning the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> news summary. He also watches morning television shows before leaving for the Oval Office about 7 a.m. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the president returns to the residence between 6 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. `` It's so much earlier -LRB- than when he was vice president -RRB- because he does n't have that drive home. I mean, it's wonderful,'' the first lady said Describing a typical evening at home, she said, `` We'd sit in our little room, private room, watch the television, have dinner. Then he'd go to his office and I'd go to mine, probably.'' Most nights, she said, they use the <LOCATION> china </LOCATION> service from <PERSON> Woodrow </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s presidency but `` we can do anything we want. Is n't that fun?'' She said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as president is working `` exactly the same'' routine he followed as vice president. `` I mean, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was born, I think, on this schedule.'' Does he bring work home? `` Yes, he always has,'' his wife said. `` He does a lot of reading. And he does an awful lot of personal writing. He brings home mail, works on it. He gets his little briefcase sent up ahead, full of work.'' Typically, they go to bed between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m., Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. She said she walked their dog, <PERSON> Millie </PERSON>, at 10 p.m. on a recent night. The president, suffering from what Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said was the flu, `` was asleep at that moment.''

<HEAD>Broader Civil Rights Agenda with Reagan Gone</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Affordable housing, the minimum wage and other issues not tied directly to fighting racial bias are moving onto the shopping list of civil rights forces as they gear up for the post-Reagan era on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. `` The traditional notion of what a civil rights bill is is sort of going through a change,'' says <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Grady </PERSON>, a labor official and legislative chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>. Issues that civil rights advocates group under the heading of economic justice, often dealing with labor and welfare, are prominent on the list. Civil rights for the disabled, legal services for the poor and mandatory leave from work for parents of newborns and sick children are all priorities for the <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella group that takes in virtually the entire civil rights community. The new emphasis represents not so much a change in direction as a return to issues that were largely ignored while civil rights forces skirmished with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration throughout much of the 1980s. Not all of the new priorities are economic. For example, civil rights advocates continue to press for easier voter registration and they are preparing to fight English-only legislation that would bar bilingual education programs for Hispanics. `` It is an aggressive and ambitious agenda,'' says <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Neas </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. `` But we are confident that the 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will pass it. We hope that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will play a constructive role.'' As usual, civil rights advocates are watching carefully to see if President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will name federal judges inclined toward moderate positions or hard-line conservatives who might challenge the legal changes of the past three decades. Judicial nominations are always a chief concern of civil rights groups. They count the defeat of outspoken conservative <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> for the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> as one of their most important victories of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> era. But the showdown over <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> represented only one in a series of Capitol Hill victories for civil rights forces over the last eight years. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> prevented the right wing from passing any major items on its legislative agenda and, furthermore, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years passed many important civil rights initiatives,'' says <PERSON> Neas </PERSON>. The conference points with pride to the success of last year's bill to toughen fair housing enforcement, recent victories on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> sanctions legislation and the <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> holiday, plus the congressional override of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of the Civil Rights Restoration Act That legislation came in response to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> decision, in which the justices held that the government could not deny federal aid to one program merely because of discrimination in an unrelated program operated by the same institution. In fact, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has passed so many measures urged by civil rights advocates that they now say some of the most pressing needs lie outside the legislative arena. That is especially so with the departure of <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> as attorney general and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, the longtime head of the civil rights division in the <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. A recent report from the <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, a 17-member panel of former federal officials, was sharply critical of the department's enforcement record in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> era. It said, for example, that the <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> filed about 10 housing bias cases annually, half the number under the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administrations. `` I think the question of enforcement of civil rights laws will be stronger, because I think that with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> gone, there will be no great voice of weakening,'' says <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. There may be some reluctance to move forward with civil rights legislation until President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> indicates what he might accept. `` I think that's just a sensible thing to do,'' says Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s civil rights and civil liberties subcommittee Meanwhile, he envisions hearings in the year ahead to determine just how well the existing civil rights laws are being enforced. Additional sessions of his panel will take up the long-festering question of whether college entrance examinations are skewed toward whites and thus place minority students at an unfair disadvantage. The Equal Rights Amendment to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution, which would ban discrimination on the basis of gender, remains a cause dear to women's groups and many civil rights advocates. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> says, however, that the measure will not be brought to the floor unless there is enough support to pass it.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> defended the ethical conduct of high-ranking officials in his administration Monday but said he might have to tighten standards and make `` our people bend over backwards'' so they avoid even the appearance of conflict of interest. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s statement came as <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, his longtime counsel and chief ethics adviser, reversed an earlier decision and resigned as chairman of a multimillion-dollar communications company. Last week, Dr. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, the president's nominee as secretary of health and human services, asked if he could take a paid sabbatical leave from the <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> while serving in the Cabinet. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said later he would forfeit his accumulated sabbatical pay, estimated at $ 300,000. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said both officials had acted properly and gone beyond what was actually required. The president also defended former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, his nominee to be secretary of defense, against new allegations of womanizing and drinking, as well as other matters. Asked if would still endorse Tower, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Yes, I can and I will right now.'' He said some of the allegations about Tower have been examined by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and found to be groundless. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` If somebody comes up with facts, I hope I'm not narrow-minded enough that I would n't take another look.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said all of <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s actions had been reviewed and approved by the Office of Government Ethics as he served for eight years as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s counsel during his vice presidency. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` We are in a new era on these matters. Matters that might have been approved and looked at one way, may have a different perception today. ... So, I think it might be different now. I have to approach it differently as president.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that when it comes to the appearance of conflict of interest, `` I'd like our people to bend over backwards ... as far as we possibly can.'' On the other hand, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he did n't want to go overboard. `` I do n't want to have the standards set in such an irresponsible way that good people just throw up their hands and say, ` Look, who needs that kind f grief, who needs it, why should I have to give up all my whatever it is _ a health plan from <ORGANIZATION> XYZ </ORGANIZATION> company?' `` And yet,'' he added, `` we're in a different time now. We're in a time when we've got to set these standards as high as possible.'' Spurred by publicity about his finances, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> announced he was stepping down as chairman of the family-owned <ORGANIZATION> Summit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and putting his personal assets _ estimated at $ 10 million _ into a blind trust. The Office of Government Ethics is investigating whether <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> should have reported $ 89,000 in income from the company in 1985 and 1986, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in Tuesday's editions. A reporter for the newspaper had raised the issue Monday, and the office said later in the day that it was investigating, the Times said. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> did not return a telephone call from the reporter seeking comment on why the money was not reported, the Times said. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> deferred receiving the income, his financial adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheets </PERSON> told the Times. But deferred income had to be reported in the year it is earned, said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, deputy director of the ethics office, according to the newspaper. Earlier, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> had said he would remain as head of the firm but would refuse a salary, complying with rules announced by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last July during the presidential campaign. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> changed his mind and decided to resign after consulting with the leaders of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s new ethics commission and seeing his financial background become front-page news. `` He has done nothing wrong,'' said White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` There's been no conflict of interest. He has not profited or benefited in any way from his government service but the issue has been raised now in the press and so he simply wanted to take care of it.'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> is the latest <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appointee to find himself in the spotlight after questions about his ethical or personal conduct. Allegations about drinking and womanizing by Tower resulted in a delay on a confirmation vote by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> sought a ruling on whether he could accept $ 300,000 in sabbatical pay earned as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> while taking a leave to serve in the Cabinet. Saying he wanted to avoid even the appearance of any conflict of interest, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said he would forfeit the sabbatical pay. Rejecting the notion the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration was having problems with ethics, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` It's the president's spotlight of focus on this matter that's caused everyone to be so ultrasensitive about every little thing. And so be it.'' Talking about <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` There was no real problem in either case but to avoid the appearance of conflict and to get on with the business, they said, ` Fine, do it.''' He said <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s decision was prompted in part by stories in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> which noted that the <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had a policy banning employees from serving in board chairmanships and from earning outside income. `` Rather than try to let that fester, you simply deal with it and go on,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Although <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> worked in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, he was not bound by those rules because he was employed by then-Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, whose policy was more lenient. Over the past eight years, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> was paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for serving as chairman of the company that owns more at least a dozen radio stations and has about 130,000 cable television subscribers in the South.

 A year ago, the hopes of families of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen shot down over <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> during the Vietnam War were buoyed by <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>'s declaration that it was prepared to hand over the remains of 83 airmen to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials. But a diplomatic stalemate, which some congressmen blame largely on <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> inaction, has prevented the return of the bodies and dimmed hopes for a return any time soon. `` They've made these gestures in the last year to turn remains over and so far the good faith has n't been followed up on,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>. `` There's -LRB- the remains of -RRB- 80 American soldiers over there ... and we're tripping over bureaucracy. During a January 1988 trip to <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, Reps. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>, D-Ind., and <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> were told by <PERSON> Tep </PERSON> <PERSON> Henn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, that the Cambodian government had the bodies of the American servicemen and would return them to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials The condition: the administration would have to make the request directly. The lawmakers lobbied the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and enlisted the help of senior legislators, including the late Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, D-Ala., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> investigations subcommittee But the administration agreed only to send a message through a third party, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not recognize the Cambodian regime of Premier <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, installed by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON> and his brutal <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> regime were driven from power by Vietnamese forces in late 1978. `` We do not have diplomatic relations -LRB- with <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> -RRB- and we do n't recognize it, so any diplomatic approach would be inappropriate,'' said <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Almasov </PERSON>, an east Asian specialist at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The congressional critics point to diplomatic contact with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> over soldiers missing-in-action there. `` We do n't recognize <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> but we're constantly interacting with them,'' <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> said. `` Half the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been over there'' as well as special <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> emissaries. `` We've picked up remains from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and they're not exactly our friends either,'' he said. `` We allowed them to get some political mileage.'' While <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> is essentially a satellite of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, diplomatic contact with <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> is a more delicate matter than dealing with <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, which is largely accepted despite the lack of diplomatic ties. In <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, three rebel groups including the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> headed by <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON> and two others supported by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid have been fighting to overthrow the Vietnam-installed government. With <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s pledge to withdraw its troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> is desperately seeking legitimacy for his government. Earlier this year he visited <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> for the first time for negotiations with Thai leaders to seek a resolution to the 10-year conflict. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials fear that the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government would simply use <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contact over the MIA issue as a political tool. `` Obviously what the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> regime wants from us is some sort of diplomatic approach that would confer some sort of legitimacy on them,'' <PERSON> Almasov </PERSON> said. `` Since we feel the MIA issue is a humanitarian one and since we have made it clear that we are prepared at any time to receive the remains they say they have, we feel they should respond positively.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> congressmen say they are well aware of <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>'s political motivations, but they believe that direct contact over the remains alone would not seriously affect American foreign policy in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> `` I have no desire to build him up and give him credibility ... but my God, we have to be willing to at least talk to the people,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. He added that <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials `` think it will shake our credibility in the region and insult <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. I do n't.'' The congressmen believe <PERSON> Phnom </PERSON> <PERSON> Penh </PERSON> is genuinely willing to turn over the remains. `` They have clearly seen the positive exposure <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has gotten by turning remains over. I think they would like to duplicate that,'' <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> recently reiterated his willingness to discuss the MIA issue with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. But <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> predicted that <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> leaders would hold out for direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contact so they can `` get more bang for their effort.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will meet in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> later this month with King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, and then at the White House in the spring with them and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, according to <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials. The <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> talks will be held when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the two Arab leaders attend the funeral of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Details of the separate visits to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> will be worked out over the next few weeks, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials speaking on condition of anonymity said Sunday. The main topics are the future of restive Palestinians on the Israeli-held <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, and the role the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will try to play in settling the 40-year-old <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s funeral, which will draw scores of world leaders to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, is accelerating <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s introduction to murky <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> diplomacy. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy is now under review by the new administration, but Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said at his confirmation hearing last month that he is opposed to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> all notified the new administration separately that they would like to visit <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in the spring, which could drive <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to an early decision on how to approach the Palestinian problem and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s troubles with its Arab neighbors. After a slow start, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration tried to steer <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> toward a peace settlement, but that was undercut by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. The administration then tried to set up <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> negotiations, but despite four trips to the region by former Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, the effort failed. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> both rejected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposals for peace talks while <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, kept Palestinians from meeting with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. In one of its final acts, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration broke a 13-year freeze and opened talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, but there are no indications this has improved prospects for a settlement or an easing of violence in the Israeli-held territories. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> would make separate visits to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said they all asked to be received in the spring and timetables were being worked out. Administration officials on Jan. 28 opened informal talks with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on possible arms sales to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. There were no items on the list for <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> since 1985 has excluded until the kingdom shows willingness to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, to whom it lost the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> war. Jordanian Prime Minister <PERSON> Zaid </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON> was asked in an interview published Sunday in the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Watan whether he thought the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would offer a new <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace initiative. `` We're fed up with initiatives,'' <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON> said. `` The basis for a settlement and the solutions are there, and agreed upon internationally, with the exception of the Israeli stance. And regrettably they -LRB- <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> -RRB- are supported by the American stance.''

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> when he first got to know <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>. `` They were around the office all the time, mostly with a press release demanding my resignation.'' White, a sandy-haired Texan, was <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s handpicked choice to head the party. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> were aides to Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> who was opposing the incumbent president's bid for renomination. This was down and dirty, no-holds-barred politics. `` I'll whip his ass,'' the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had said of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> senator who bore one of the most famous names in American politics. But White was an old pro and <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> were budding young pros. `` Hell, they were so nice about it, I just got so I would invite them in for a cup of coffee,'' recalled White. `` We just got to where we liked each other. I knew what they were doing and they knew what I was doing.'' Six years later, <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> became <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman and on Friday the 47-year-old <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> will succeed him in that post. That transition will take place when the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meets at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hotel a few miles from the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, a building where only one Democrat has resided during the past 20 years. When <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> began his quest for the chairmanship his opponents portrayed him as `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>'s man,'' a reference to his role in <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s presidential campaign. And if not <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>'s man, then `` Teddy's man,'' a reference to his earlier involvement with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. `` Ultra liberal,'' was the assessment of the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> party chairman. The wrong symbol, said many party officials, at a time when the electorate seemed more comfortable with conservative views. Yet, none of that criticism stuck and one by one <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s four opponents in the chairmanship race dropped out and endorsed him. In part, he succeeded because the only label that has stuck firmly on <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> is `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> insider.'' `` He's nobody's man but his own,'' said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> could say no to me or to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> or to anyone else if he believed that whatever was requested was n't in the interests of the party.'' From his childhood, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> has bridged two very different worlds. He grew up in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>, but his parents sent him to predominantly white private schools on the Upper East Side of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. He attended <ORGANIZATION> Middlebury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> where he was one of only a handful of black students. When he joined <ORGANIZATION> Sigma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Epsilon </ORGANIZATION> fraternity, the house was stripped of its national membership for violating the whites-only charter. At <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, one of his professors was <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> ran the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> before joining <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s staff and becoming a senior aide on his presidential campaign. Later, he became general counsel of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> which <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> chaired. Big-time, big-money law beckoned and <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> now is a partner in one of the capital's biggest, most politically active firms. That was the period he also became deputy chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Once again, he was seen as `` Teddy's man'' at the <ORGANIZATION> DNC </ORGANIZATION>, the party official who would look after the senator's interests in advance of the 1984 presidential campaign <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Campion </PERSON> was at the <ORGANIZATION> DNC </ORGANIZATION> as <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s man. <PERSON> Campion </PERSON> recalled that instead of becoming rivals they became friends _ an outcome typical of <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s career. His law practice prospered with clients that included the Japanese electronics industry and the government of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. So did his establishment credentials. He is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Middlebury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trustees </ORGANIZATION> and chairman of the advisory committee for the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>. During a visit to <ORGANIZATION> Middlebury </ORGANIZATION> last fall, a student asked <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> for advice on pursuing a political career. His response offered an insight to his careful operating style: `` Keep a diary. Write down the names of people you meet and then keep track of them. Remember them when you meet them again. Connections are important.'' A little ironic coming from a man whose connections were used against him in his most prominent effort to strike out on his own in politics. When <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> did n't run in 1984, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> stayed on the sidelines. That was the campaign in which <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> emerged as a force in <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> politics. Four years later, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was rebuffed when he tried to get <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> to head his 1988 presidential campaign. As the campaign approached the end of the primary season, the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> forces began looking ahead to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> that would take place in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in July. It was clear that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would be the presidential nominee, but <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and his followers had a full agenda. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON>, the populist agriculture commissioner from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was the choice of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> aides to head their convention operation. But then <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a top adviser to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, suggested <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> knew the players and knew the territory; <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> did n't,'' said <PERSON> White </PERSON>, who also was advising <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. To the relief of most Democrats, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> agreed to take on the job. `` There was a rather tense atmosphere going into the convention,'' recalled <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>, chairman of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign. `` The Reverend <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had started a bus caravan in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> which picked up speed and people on the way to the convention _ this was after several weeks where Reverend <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was hitting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> pretty hard, building an expectation that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> deserved more than he had received. `` None of that created an environment which assured any kind of unity,'' <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> met privately on the Saturday before the convention and the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> aide showed up with a list of his concerns. By the time their meeting ended, <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> said, `` I understood where he was coming from and I was able to respond to most of them and give an indication where I was coming from.'' There would be more meetings including one that included <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The result was a convention that ended on a note of harmony. During his visit to <LOCATION> Middlebury </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> candidacy showed that `` the issue of race has become less of a factor in American politics.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s accession to the chairmanship of his party may confirm that assessment _ or may offer new evidence of how strong a factor race continues to be.

<HEAD>Drug Czar Assesses the Problem in Detroit</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Drug czar-designate <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> took a close look at `` the heart of the problem'' with a two-hour tour of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, a visit that `` underlined the urgency of working fast to make things better.'' `` We have a deadly serious issue on our hands,'' he said Sunday in a telephone interview from the Detroit airport. `` It's compelling This was fact-finding for me, very preliminary, to find out what people on the ground are facing. `` They emphasized what I was looking at was the heart of the problem,'' he said. `` Downtown <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> is as bad as it gets anywhere.'' Last year, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> recorded 629 homicides, an 8.3 percent drop from the 686 homicides in 1987, according to city police statistics. The city figures did not indicate how many of them were drug-related. An analysis of <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> crime statistics by the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> showed <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was the only city last year with a higher ratio of murders per 100,000 people. The visit did n't result in any specific plans for how the war against drugs should be waged or how he should handle his new job, said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who has been nominated by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to become director of national drug control policy. `` I've got to work all parts of it,'' he said. `` What I saw today only underlined the urgency of working fast to make things better. It must get better.'' <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> Police Cmdr. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON> told him, `` One index showing we are winning the battle will be when the price goes up and purity goes down, but prices are down and purity is up,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> recalled. Whether drug trafficking was going on during the tour was a matter of opinion. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said he did n't see any. But the officers accompanying him _ <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON>, who is chief of staff to <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, and Sgt. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> _ said they did. `` My eyes are n't sufficiently expert, discerning yet'' to spot the drug deals, he said. `` It was also Sunday afternoon, not Saturday night.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> deferred questions on what the drug budget should be, saying that six months after he is confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> _ hearings begin March 1 _ he will have completed a national drug strategy and `` that will have budget implications.'' He said he plans additional fact-finding tours, but he refused to disclose which cities he might visit. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> because of a speaking engagement at <ORGANIZATION> Cranbrook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, a private school in the wealthy suburb of <LOCATION> Bloomfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>. The talk had been scheduled before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nominated him to the drug czar post. `` I told them when I got to the podium that I've just been in downtown <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and now I'm in one of the loveliest places in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. I feel like I'm getting the bends.''

 Cutting into line at a bus stop or into a ticket line at a subway or train station is now punishable by fine in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. So is displaying `` visibly unpleasant living things'' such as snakes or worms for sale on the street. The formerly simply discourteous, or distasteful, practices are on a new list of petty offenses _ with transgressors subject to an official warning and a $ 5.75 fine. The new list was released last weekend by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and its additions are expected to become law. Other new offenses include luring customers to buy `` supernatural potions'' by claiming they can cure and prevent illness. Also new to the list of 21 petty offenses is disobeying officials in times of emergency, such as a snowstorm, fire or traffic accident, and neglecting one's duty for public safety, such as making sure street lamps are turned on. Turning off lights at public gatherings and failing to repair a house that is dangerous to passersby, or a structure that may fall over, will draw also fines.

 It's a mail carrier's nightmare, a magazine lover's delight. Someone is ordering magazine subscriptions by the dozens for five city officials in this increasingly literate northern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> town. `` It's pretty entertaining,'' said city Service Director <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramer </PERSON>, who has received 70 subscriptions from the anonymous donor. `` There is always something to read. ... There are a lot of magazines that I never knew existed.'' Although some of the magazines have been obscure, most are fairly well-known. They include Time, Popular Photography, Working Woman, People, Sassy, Men's Health, Life, Consumer Reports, and Ladies' Home Journal `` If the magazines had been weird magazines, I would have been more concerned, but they were n't,'' said Mayor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON>, who's received about a dozen subscriptions The officials have asked the magazines' publishers to cancel the subscriptions, and in most cases the companies have complied. Some magazines have arrived with cards telling the new and surprised reader that the subscription is a gift. For example, <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Wilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> got a card saying Lamb had given her a subscription. `` It's a nuisance,'' said <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON>, who later was billed for the subscription. `` People keep coming up to me and thanking me for sending them a magazine, and I have to tell them that I did n't send it. ...

 As gingerbread men go, the one at <PERSON> Kinsley </PERSON>'s Market in nearby <LOCATION> Brodheadsville </LOCATION> is very big But at 12 feet tall, it's not big enough for the <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>. And if it were big enough, it still would n't make the book because <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> does n't have a category for gingerbread men. `` It's disappointing to us,'' said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lockwitch </PERSON>, assistant manager at <PERSON> Kinsley </PERSON>'s bakery. `` If we would have known, we would have attempted something else or we would n't have bothered.'' <PERSON> Lockwitch </PERSON> said bakery manager <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Laiso </PERSON> called Guinness before he and <PERSON> Lockwitch </PERSON> made the giant cookie. She says he was told that <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> would consider their claim after they had made their gingerbread man. But <PERSON> Cyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, assistant editor at <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION>, said she told a <PERSON> Kinsley </PERSON> employee that there was no category for a gingerbread man and little chance that <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> would add the category. `` People sometimes do n't want to hear what you're saying,'' she said. `` They do n't want to hear, ` No,' because they're determined to do their thing.'' It took 300 pounds of gingerbread mix, 280 pounds of icing, 600 egg whites and nearly 100 hours to create the giant cookie. `` With all the attention and publicity we got, we thought we were in,'' <PERSON> Lockwitch </PERSON> said. But late last month, <PERSON> Kinsley </PERSON>'s received a letter from Guiness explaining the book's position. Adding insult to injury, the letter added that <PERSON> Kinsley </PERSON>'s had no claim on the world record anyway because a chef in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, created a 24-foot gingerbread man in 1987.

 Residents are expressing relief because of the arrests of five people who are accused of holding up Amish farmers at gunpoint as they milked cows, drove buggies or made harnesses. `` Two of these men have confessed, and we've recovered some of the billfolds taken in the holdups,'' said <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyrdum </PERSON>. `` I feel we've got all the people involved.''

A statue honoring <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON>, who once operated a gristmill here, stands in the heart of downtown, and billboards extol the <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON> <PERSON> Motel </PERSON> and Mini-Warehouses. The town typically is so peaceful that it attracted a group of Amish who left <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> in the winter of 1944. But that serenity was shattered last month when armed robbers began sticking up the Amish as they milked cows in barns or drove their buggies. The holdups began Jan. 22 when two Amish farmers were robbed of $ 85 by three armed men in masks and camouflage outfits who burst into a barn in nearby <LOCATION> Ethridge </LOCATION>. Five days later, three Amish men were robbed of about $ 140 in two separate holdups when a man leaped into their buggies, brandished a gun and demanded cash. On Jan. 30, two men, one of them carrying a sawed-off shotgun, took $ 300 from an Amish harnessmaker as he worked in his shop on a farm north of <LOCATION> Ethridge </LOCATION>. Residents were outraged by the robberies. `` The people who live here know the -LRB- Amish -RRB- and do business with them,'' said District Attorney General <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Bottoms </PERSON>. `` They do n't ever cause anybody any trouble ... They mind their own business and raise their families.'' The Amish, a conservative offshoot of the <ORGANIZATION> Mennonite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, are noted for a lifestyle that's dogmatic in its simplicity. The women wear long dresses and bonnets; the men black, round hats, with dark blue jackets and pants. They disdain buttons as a sign of vanity. Among themselves, they still speak German, accounting for a persistent accent in their English. They refuse to own telephones or automobiles, although they will ride buses or occasionally in a car. And they believe in non-violence, which authorities said has made them easy prey for bandits. `` People do n't like to see the Amish picked on,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who works for the <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ambulance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` At the same time, it makes people angry that they do n't do anything to fight back.'' The recent holdups, as well as the unsolved Jan. 29 robbery and stabbing death of an elderly non-Amish man in <LOCATION> Ethridge </LOCATION>, prompted <PERSON> Pyrdum </PERSON>'s investigators to work around the clock. The break came, <PERSON> Pyrdum </PERSON> said, when they were able to link a partial license plate number to the description of a pickup truck used in the harness shop robbery. On Thursday, deputies arrested <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>, 24, and his nephews, <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> J.D </PERSON>. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 18, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 22, all from <LOCATION> Lawrenceburg </LOCATION>, and charged them with various counts of armed robbery. Each was being held on $ 250,000 bond. Two <LOCATION> Lawrenceburg </LOCATION> juveniles, ages 16 and 17, also were arrested. Bottoms said the state has filed a motion to have them tried as adults. Although the Amish have been reluctant in the past to file charges, neither Pyrdum nor Bottoms said they expect any problem bringing the case to trial. `` We do n't have a lot of cases with the -LRB- Amish -RRB-, but when we do they'll come and testify truthfully,'' said Bottoms. `` I do n't have any doubt that they'll continue to cooperate with us.'' The arrests brought a welcome sense of relief to the Amish, although many were reticent. `` I'm glad they were caught. It was correct to assist the sheriff's department in order to stop the robbing,'' said a 67-year-old Amish farmer who spoke on the condition that his name not be used.

 Pravda reported that the last Soviet soldier had left the capital, but several hundred <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops guarded <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s airport on Monday as military transports flew in grain and other supplies. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily also reported that Soviet troops would move Monday out of the main military complex at <LOCATION> Shindand </LOCATION>, in western <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The paper said Soviet defensive checkpoints along the withdrawal route from the capital had been removed as far as 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. `` Yesterday, the last Soviet soldier left <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>,'' Pravda said in Monday's report. However, several hundred Soviet soldiers were seen at the airport today. Soviet officials said about 1,000 Soviet soldiers were still at the airport on the outskirts of the city. They said the last convoy left the capital on Saturday. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the troops at the airport are assisting the supply airlift into the city and are not expected to pull out until Feb. 12 or Feb. 14. The officials said troops were still moving up the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>, the only land route north from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to the Soviet border. They said the troop movement was slow and there had been avalanches and some casualties, but no rebel attacks. On Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> quoted the commander of Soviet forces in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, Gen. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromov </PERSON>, as saying the withdrawal was proceeding according to schedule. `` He said that the column of Soviet troops did not come under fire. ... There were snow slides during the withdrawal, though, and three men were killed and one was injured by them,'' the radio reported. In <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on Sunday, President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> told about 10,000 members of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> that his Marxist government will survive the rebel onslaught despite the Soviet pullout after more than nine years of occupation. `` God is with us. The people are with us. We will win the war,'' <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> told about 10,000 members of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION>, who gathered in freezing temperatures near the presidential palace. Soviet and Afghan officials said during the weekend there were about 1,000 Soviet soldiers still in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and that they could be gone as early as Wednesday. In neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> extended talks on the civil war. Guerrilla sources said he would meet Monday with the Moslem insurgents fighting the Soviet-backed Afghan government. Leaders of the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> - and Pakistan-based resistance signed a cooperation pact Sunday in the Iranian capital, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said The agreement could boost the guerrillas' chances of taking over in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and creating an Islamic republic once the Soviets are gone. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s rally, broadcast on national television, was staged largely for the dozens of foreign journalists in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> for the Soviet withdrawal. `` The <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> armies are leaving the country and we will defend ourselves,'' said the 43-year-old <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, dressed in combat fatigues. `` We have to be strong. We have to unite.'' As he spoke, more than a dozen giant Soviet transport planes streaked off in different directions, spewing flares designed to deflect heat-seeking missiles fired by the guerrillas, or mujahedeen. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> sent troops into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to replace one Marxist regime with another and stayed to help fight the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> - and Pakistani-backed insurgents Under a U.N.-mediated agreement, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> agreed last year to withdraw all its troops out by Feb. 15. The Soviets began their pullout in May and resumed it January, when convoys of tanks, trucks and armored personnel carriers started heading up the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> toward the Soviet border 260 miles away. The Pravda report said that in the western sector, two columns had left <LOCATION> Shindand </LOCATION> heading towards <LOCATION> Kushka </LOCATION> on the Soviet border. `` On Feb. 6, Soviet units will leave shindand,'' Pravda said. `` On Monday, the first meeting to welcome the columns crossing to the Soviet bank will take place in <LOCATION> Termez </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>'' it said. The guerrilla leaders began arriving in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, on Sunday night to confer before meeting with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, guerrilla sources said. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> refused to give details of the guerrilla accord signed in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The Afghan guerrillas are split into two groups: the minority Shiite alliance, based in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and the larger Sunni coalition in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. `` They finally signed an agreement for cooperation about a future government for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said it was believed the two groups agreed on the number of seats that will be offered in the 480-member Shura assembly to <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> representatives.

<HEAD>Antarctic Oil Spill Creates ``The Experiment Nobody Wanted''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After decades of studying wildlife in an unspoiled area of <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>, scientists have begun a new, unwelcome line of research: the effects of an oil spill. `` This disaster is the experiment nobody wanted,'' said <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Talmadge </PERSON>. By Tuesday, American cleanup crews are expected to reach the area affected by the sinking of an oil-laden supply ship, which ran aground Jan. 28 off the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. Scientists have already seen oil-covered and apparently lethargic seals, three dead penguins and disappearances of young nesting birds, said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLaca </PERSON>, chief scientist of the foundation's division of polar programs. Thirty-eight of 40 penguins checked Friday bore traces of oil. Thousands of dead and dying krill, shrimplike crustaceans that are a key food for bigger animals, have shown up on beaches, <PERSON> DeLaca </PERSON> told reporters by telephone from <LOCATION> Palmer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>, a research outpost near the spill. `` All the principle -LRB- penguin -RRB- rookeries here are now surrounded by fuel oil,'' he said. `` What its effect could be on the birds is anybody's guess.'' <LOCATION> Adelie </LOCATION> penguin chicks are expected to leave their nests for the first time in a few days, swimming into contaminated waters. Other birds are being exposed to the oil as they land on water or dive into it to feed. Scientists are concerned that birds may freeze to death if the oil disrupts their natural insulation, or be poisoned if they swallow oil while preening themselves or eating oil-covered prey. The spill struck an area that has `` the largest and most diverse plant and animal populations of the continent,'' said <PERSON> Polly </PERSON> <PERSON> Penhale </PERSON>, manager of the science foundation's polar biology and medicine program. Apart from the large seal population, about 30,000 sea birds live there, including <LOCATION> Adelie </LOCATION> and chinstrap penguins, cormorants, kelp gulls and giant petrels, she said. Scientists have studied wildlife in the area for more than 20 years, but now the pristine nature of the area has been altered. `` The paths of research that have been followed down there have been forever changed,'' said <PERSON> Talmadge </PERSON>. `` I think if you're a scientist in the year 2035, you've got to remember there was an oil spill.'' <PERSON> DeLaca </PERSON> said the highly sensitive environment `` has been compromised in a way that we ca n't even evaluate right now.'' <PERSON> Langdon </PERSON> <PERSON> Quetin </PERSON>, research biologist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, said if the oil spill causes dramatic damage or long-term effects on plants and animals, `` then we ca n't really depend on the area as a natural uncontaminated laboratory. `` That really is unfortunate, to say the least, because it is one of the few areas in the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> we have good logistics to,'' he said. `` It will be the ruination of a good laboratory, at least in the near future, at least as a natural uncontaminated study area.'' Some scientists are particularly concerned about fish and other organisms kept in tanks at <LOCATION> Palmer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>, which marine botanist <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Neushul </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> calls `` probably the best marine biology laboratory in the Antarctic.'' The tanks draw water from the nearby harbor, and if oil contaminates that supply, the experiments might have to be stopped. Nobody knows yet whether that will be a problem, <PERSON> Penhale </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Neushul </PERSON> said one factor boding poorly for the area's wildlife is that the spill involved fuel oil, which is `` much more toxic than crude oil'' because it can damage biological tissue. <PERSON> Neushul </PERSON>, who investigated a spill of partially refined oil off the <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast some 30 years ago, said the effects of that spill lasted 17 years. In addition, recovery in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> may be prolonged because bacteria there will need a long time to break the oil down, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON>, professor of marine ecology at the <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanography </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jolla </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>.

 The road to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> is littered with burned-out Afghan army tanks, trucks and security posts abandoned by retreating communist forces. Dotted along the highway leading from the Pakistani border to the <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> capital about 120 miles to the west are signs of the collapse of the Afghan army in the area as Moslem insurgents move in. Guerrilla commanders say Afghan government forces began to disintegrate after Soviet troops pulled out of the area late last year under a total withdrawal plan now in its final days. `` The communists are all gone. They are running for their lives,'' said one guerrilla commander. Tanks and armored personnel carriers destroyed by guerrilla rockets stood abandoned in the center of the highway or lie in roadside ditches. Trucks and radio command vehicles stood where their crews abandoned them. Senior guerrilla commanders told a visiting journalist over the weekend that Afghan army forces in the area are surrounded in the major city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> and a few outlying towns. They claim government troops are demoralized, that just a handful of diehard communists want to fight. The Afghan army is composed mainly of ill-trained conscripts who are unwilling to fight for the Soviet-backed <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government. Western intelligence estimates put its strength nationwide at 30,000 troops. Afghan army units around <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> have put up little resistance as the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> withdraws after nine years of propping up the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime. Commander <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaher </PERSON> said the guerrillas expect <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> to surrender soon when its supplies run out, but would attack if the garrison tried to hold out. The guerrillas, he said, wanted to avoid civilian casualties. The only sign of fighting were a few salvos from government artillery in the distance around <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, which is about 90 miles east of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Guerrilla commanders said 12,000 insurgents were surrounding <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, but there was little fighting. `` When the communist government is destroyed the fighting will end,'' said <PERSON> Khial </PERSON> <PERSON> Nur </PERSON>, a commander of the guerrillas, most of whom are based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The insurgents are aided chiefly by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. An Afghan army prisoner dressed in a ragged green uniform appeared dazed and shocked as guerrillas helped him walk to their base. `` He does not want to fight. We will look after him,'' said one guerrilla. Some of the abandoned Afghan army bases and security posts along the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> highway bore signs of heavy fighting. Walls had been shatteered by mortar and rocket fire and were pocked with machine-gun bullets. Other installations were undamaged and appeared to have been abandoned without a fight. At <LOCATION> Landhi </LOCATION> Khyber, guerrillas relaxed in a sprawling Afghan army base. <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> flags with crossed swords fluttered from the top of the barracks and guerrillas prayed in the courtyard. The burned-out wrecks of about 20 Afghan army trucks littered what was once the motor pool. A few bits of green and khaki army clothing lay on the ground, flung away by fleeing soldiers. At <LOCATION> Gerde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ghous </LOCATION>, about 20 miles east of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, guerrillas showed off a captured barracks they said once housed 1,200 government militia troops. Buildings were pocked with bullet holes. Two shattered tanks stood on the nearby highway, their guns pointing blindly into the air. Guerrillas had crawled their names and Islamic slogans on captured army posts. `` Long live Islamic holy war,'' said a slogan at <PERSON> Ghazi </PERSON> <PERSON> Abad </PERSON>. Insurgents wearing traditional baggy Afghan trousers, long shirts and turbans perched on gutted tanks, yelling greetings to bands of compatriots who roared up the highway in trucks and buses. Islamic flags and posters were plastered on the wrecked army vehicles. `` <PERSON> Dushman </PERSON>, dushman,'' beaming guerrillas shouted as they pointed to the tanks and other wrecked vehicles, using the Pushtu word for enemy. All of the wrecked and abandoned army vehicles were Soviet-made. Operating instructions in Russian on metal plates were still bolted inside the turrets of burned out T-54 and T-55 tanks. Captured army trucks still in working condition were being used by the guerrillas to ferry men and supplies towards <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. Islamic banners fluttered from the trucks and pictures of guerrilla leaders were plastered on windshields. Bands of guerrilla fighters with bandoliers of bullets across their chests and machine guns and rifles hanging from their shoulders stood guard in every village and hamlet along the highway. `` We are happy. Soon we will have Islamic government and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> will be free,'' said one of the guerrillas.

 Canadians looking for assurance that their country wo n't be ignored by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> now that a free trade agreement between the two countries is in place should be cheered by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> this week. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> continues a pattern set by <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in making his first presidential trip abroad to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. There have been hints that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s half-day meeting Friday with Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> will be just the first of several 1989 sessions, an increase from the recent pattern of annual meetings. Canadians often complain that Americans ignore or take for granted their northern neighbor and fail to recognize that their trade relationship is the largest of any two countries in the world. After a heated election campaign last fall that attracted an unusual amount of international attention, <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won a second consecutive majority government. That cleared the way for the free trade agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that he and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed in January 1988 to take effect on New Year's Day, as scheduled. The pact phases out all remaining tariffs between the two countries over a 10-year period, sets up panels to resolve disputes and eases barriers to investment and trade in energy and services. Opponents had argued that <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> risked being overpowered by the vastly greater population and economic power of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Labor groups in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> are now gearing up to bring attention to the closings of any plants that can be blamed on the trade pact. Although the pact's supporters forecast a net increase of 250,000 jobs in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> over 10 years, they concede some plant closings will take place as business and industry restructure for the larger North American market. The summit Friday is expected to be largely a formal affair that will set the stage for future working sessions. The top issue for discussion is certain to be acid rain. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice for head of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, attracted widespread attention in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> with his comments about acid rain at his nomination hearing in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In a major shift from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s policy, <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said legislation to curb acid rain is `` first out of the box'' for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration did not propose legislation to strengthen the Clean Air Act. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> has been pressing for an agreement on a timetable to reduce to specified levels coal-fired power plant emissions that damage forests and lakes. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, who shared with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> an <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> heritage and conservative outlook, has called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a `` great friend of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>.'' The prime minister said during the fall campaign that he expected his good relationship with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to produce an agreement on acid rain. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawes </PERSON>, a political scientist at <ORGANIZATION> Queen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kingston </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visit wo n't necessarily be praised here just because it is his first. `` I do n't think we're going to think of this as anything but ordinary that he should do this,'' <PERSON> Hawes </PERSON>, who specializes in Canadian-U.S. relations, said in a telephone interview. If <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had chosen another destination for his first trip, however, it would have touched off a chorus of complaints, <PERSON> Hawes </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>USDA, Chrysler Joint Venture Puts Scenic Byway Program In High Gear</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is about to announce a joint venture with the <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> division of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> to help put its recreational `` scenic byway'' program into overdrive. Billed as a `` pioneering partnership'' between <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION> and the department's <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the details are expected to be announced Thursday at a joint news conference, followed by a reception at <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s interior patio. The scenic byway program began last year with the designation of a 26-mile stretch of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Highway 64 in southeastern <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. A number of others have since been designated, and officials say various groups have worked with <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> to place interpretive signs, develop brochures and provide facilities to help make driving through national forest more enjoyable. But the addition of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> division is being counted on by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> officials to pump new life into the scenic byways program and, hopefully, become a showcase of private sector participation. A private, non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, is the prime mover in <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION>'s involvement, says <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Longan </PERSON>. The group is also the <ORGANIZATION> Skier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Longan </PERSON> said that one of the main goals of <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION> involvement is to `` increase public awareness of scenic byways'' through national promotions. There has been talk that the campaign might include <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> dealer promotions and prizes, although <PERSON> Longan </PERSON> said she was n't certain this had been settled National forest offices might be involved, too, she said. `` We've done lots of partnerships, or cooperative agreements, with non-profit organizations,'' she said. `` That's what most of our experience has been in the past. This is probably the first real big one that we've had with a private corporation.'' There has been grumbling among some <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> professionals who think the high-visibility and direct role of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> is not appropriate, although commercial products and private companies have had a long association with department promotional efforts. Most of the time in the past the identities of companies and brand names have been downplayed, as in large displays of groceries to represent family food expenditures. Generic promotion of pizza, ice cream and other foods are other examples. But <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> lawyers are not fearful that the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is doing anything wrong in its scenic byways arrangement with <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, associate general counsel, said he had not been asked for an opinion on the agency's program with the automaker, nor had he had an opportunity to study the plan. But very often, he said, private sector efforts are channeled through a foundation, usually one that is non-profit, so that a government agency can say truthfully that it does n't do business directly with the foundation. Thus, there is no conflict of interest. `` In this case, I have no idea what business <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, if any, might do with the <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> division of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` No doubt, in <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s many fleets of automobiles there are probably some <ORGANIZATION> Chyrsler </ORGANIZATION> cars and trucks.'' But <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is contributing through a foundation and `` that generally passes ethical muster and does n't raise any significant questions,'' he said.

 A report to the <ORGANIZATION> Soil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says the agency's field personnel should be rewarded for providing exceptional service to small farmers who have limited resources. The report was the result of a study by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shore </ORGANIZATION>, on the impact of the 1985 farm law on `` limited-resource farmers.'' The study was based on interviews with 1,390 farmers who farm 50 acres or less in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Farmers with household incomes of less than $ 25,000 a year were considered limited-resource farmers. The 1985 law requires farmers to have a conservation plan completed by Dec. 31, 1989, if they are to continue farming highly erodible cropland and still receive <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> benefits, including price supports and emergency aid. According to the study, only 25 percent of those surveyed had conservation plans, and 23 percent had never heard of a conservation plan. `` Only 5 percent of the limited-resource farmers, many of whom farm marginal land, felt they have a severe erosion problem,'' the agency said. The report's findings and recommendations were sent to the <ORGANIZATION> SCS </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. To raise the consciousness of <ORGANIZATION> SCS </ORGANIZATION> personnel for the special concerns of these farmers, the agency should use its award and evaluation system `` to recognize and award those working with limited-resource farmers in an exceptional manner,'' the report said.

 The dollar rose Monday, while share prices closed at another record high on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar opened higher at 129.75 yen, then edged down to finish the day at 129.70 yen, up 0.43 yen from Friday's closing of 129.27 yen. It ranged during the day between 129.70 and 130.01 yen. On the stock exchange, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, a 178.48-point gainer Friday, added another 142.97 points, or 0.45 percent, to close at 31,828.75, a new high. The index was lower at the end of the morning session but rose in the afternoon as investors began buying construction issues, said an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> who spoke on condition of anonymity. In currency dealings, the dollar opened higher after similar trends in overseas markets overnight, dealers said.

 `` A Nation at Risk,'' the landmark federal report that condemned mediocrity in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s schools nearly six years ago, shocked the nation into a flurry of reform. But three new reports describing the sad state of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> students' abilities in mathematics might be even more cause for alarm On the surface, the reports released last week revealed little we have n't heard before. Repeatedly during the last decade, international comparisons have shown <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> students lagging behind other youngsters in math. `` A World of Differences,'' a report by the <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Testing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> assessing 24,000 13-year-olds in six countries, found <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> doing best among students from <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pupils scored dead last. A report by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, `` Everybody Counts: A Report to the Nation on the <ORGANIZATION> Future </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mathematics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>,'' concluded that the nation desperately needs to agree on how math should be taught. But it noted that compared with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, math reform has consistently gotten nowhere in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> largely because our decentralized national school structure makes consensus building so difficult. `` The top-down systems have beaten us hands down,'' the report concluded. A survey conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> compared math achievement levels of first - and fifth-graders in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> It found <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> youngsters performing significantly worse than their Chinese counterparts. Interestingly, that survey also found that the American parents would be satisfied if their children scored a 70 on a math test. The Chinese parents had higher aspirations: Their children would need to score in the 90s to please them. But the larger significance of these latest reports lays in two other findings: Students scoring highest did the most homework and watched the least television. Koreans ranked first in math homework, with 45 percent doing at least one to two hours a week; <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> students ranked last, with 28 percent doing that amount. If homework is indeed so central to better math scores, and if mathematical know-how is really as crucial as everyone insists it is to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s economic competitiveness, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> may be in more trouble than realized. It's common sense that students who do the most homework usually have the strongest belief that hard work pays off. But some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> educators wonder whether these math scores demonstrate that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> youngsters have grown soft on hard work. `` I think it's a cultural phenomenon in this country,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secondary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Principals </ORGANIZATION>. `` We do n't recognize the importance of studying math or studying tough subjects. `` The countries that are most successful, like <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, say right up front that it takes hard work and long hours and grinding it out. We as a nation tend to be impatient with everything, including studying.'' Put bluntly: With math, as with no other subject, there's simply no faking it. The answer's right or wrong. You either took the time at home to memorize and drill and practice, or you did n't. But equally important, homework and a wholesome home environment are inseparable. Merely requiring teachers to assign more is like pushing on a string. Homework wo n't get done by the student who is hungry or unhealthy, or chronically unhappy in single-family home environments where parents are uninvolved in their youngsters' education Chronically weak math scores, then, indicate problems not just with our schools, but our society _ problems that wo n't be solved merely by tinkering with curricula or teaching methods, though such changes may well be in order. It means that there is probably no quick fix for low math scores, and schools ca n't solve the problem alone. Given its exactitude, mathematics is one of the truest bellwethers of the nation's progress in educating children for the 21st century. In that sense, these reports contain plenty to worry about.

<HEAD>Prison Guards Pool Resources for Hostage Insurance</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 As a broiling summer day dissolved into a sultry night at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coxsackie state prison, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Puma </PERSON> waited to see if five prison guards held hostage by prisoners would make it out alive. After 14 hours, about midnight, the inmates released their hostages. `` This guy came out _ a friend of mine _ he was bloody, beaten, battered and he wore inmate clothing. He just collapsed in my arms, crying,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Puma </ORGANIZATION>, head of the state prison guards' union. <ORGANIZATION> Puma </ORGANIZATION> saw the pain in the faces of the guards and their families and came up with an idea: The union, through <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION>, established a `` captivity coverage'' insurance plan, with benefits to be paid to survivors of prison uprisings. It's believed to be the first time an insurance company has allowed such a policy, said <PERSON> Nels </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> underwriter. Union members held hostage at least 12 hours would be paid a sum equal to half their annual salary. In the case of death or injury, the insurance benefit paid to the guard or his family would be twice the salary. A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> prison guard's average annual pay: $ 27,500. `` It's kind of like your life insurance, where you hope it never gets paid out, but it happens,'' said <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rauch </PERSON>, director of standards and accreditation for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION>, Md. `` The concept is quite nice. It's an idea that could very easily be expanded to other states.'' It's appropriate the idea should come from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a state still haunted by the 1971 riot at <LOCATION> Attica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s bloodiest prison uprising. Inmates took 39 hostages in a four-day standoff that ended in furious gunfire. Forty-three inmates and prison employees died. No one died in August's Coxsackie uprising, but it changed the lives of the five guards involved. The guards were watching a group of 32 prisoners with disciplinary problems _ the baddest of the bad _ when they were overpowered. The five guards were blindfolded and moved from cell to cell while their captors negotiated with authorities. A knife and razor blades were held to their throats and one guard was told his finger would be cut off if he did n't relinquish his wedding ring. All were beaten. `` It's probably the biggest fear of a security officer,'' <ORGANIZATION> Puma </ORGANIZATION> said. `` You're reversing the roles and now these sick and deranged people are in charge of your every move.'' Citing pending court cases and the trauma, the five former hostages would n't talk about their experiences. None of them still works as a guard. Psychological reactions to being taken hostage can range from a slight depression that lasts a few days to becoming completely dysfunctional, said Dr. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Inwald </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> psychologist who has studied the reactions of former prison hostages. `` It's controversial as to when they should go back into the prisons,'' she added. `` Going back is important to recover the feeling of being in control of your life.'' Some never go back. Of 17 guards who were held for 2 -LCB- days at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state's Sing Sing prison in 1982, only one is still working in the prisons, said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON>, a spokesman for the guards' union. `` It's not something they want to talk about,'' <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, union chief at <LOCATION> Attica </LOCATION>, said of the three guards still working there who were taken hostage in 1971. `` They've accepted it.'' None of the guards from Coxsackie, <LOCATION> Attica </LOCATION> or Sing Sing are eligible to claim money from the union's policy, which cost about $ 100,000, <ORGANIZATION> Puma </ORGANIZATION> said. The union leader has promised that dues wo n't be raised to pay for the new insurance. But he said it might be on the bargaining table when the union's contract with the state expires. <ORGANIZATION> Puma </ORGANIZATION> called the insurance `` go-fishing money.'' He said it will enable former hostages to take time off or search for a new job with fewer worries about feeding their family. `` These hostage situations do not happen every day _ thank God _ but when they do happen it's the worst thing that can happen to a person,'' he said. `` Let's do a little something extra for them.''

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar gained against the Japanese yen today, and the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s leading index rose to another record high, The dollar closed at 129.70 yen, 0.43 yen higher than Friday's close of 129.27 yen It opened at 129.75 yen and traded in a range between 129.70 yen and 130.01 yen. The higher opening in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, following the dollar's climb in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, was prompted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> employment figures announced on Friday, said a dealer with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jobless rate in January rose to 5.4 percent from December's 5.3 percent, but an increase of 408,000 in non-agricultural employees from December encouraged dollar-buying by market players who took the figure as indicating continuous growth in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy, he added. Dollar-buying also was encouraged by a meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Friday of the finance ministers of seven major industrial nations, who accepted current exchange rates, the dealer said. Japanese Finance Minister <PERSON> Tatsuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Murayama </PERSON> told a news conference today that representatives of the seven also agreed to strengthen policy coordination. The seven are the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The Bank of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> dealer said the dollar's recent upward trend is quite strong, based on such factors as high interest rates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. High <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates make dollar-denominated investments more attractive. But the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency's movement was expected to be limited as other financial markts in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, including those in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, were closed today for the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday. They will reopen Thursday. On the stock market, the 225-issue <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> gained 142.97 points, or 0.45 percent, closing at 31,828.75. The index's previous record was Friday's 31,685.78 finish A morning gain picked up speed in afternoon trading as investors began buying construction issues such as cement, said an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. Despite some profit-taking in the morning, the index rose steadily in the afternoon as currency trading became stabilized, he added. In active trading, volume on the first section was estimated at 1.3 billion shares.

He said he did not believe the order was a sign of a new crackdown on art. `` They are just punishing us for the trouble we caused,'' he said. `` I think the political element here is very small.'' <PERSON> Fei </PERSON> said a woman wanted in connection with Sunday's shooting incident had been detained by police later that day. The woman, <PERSON> Xiao </PERSON> <PERSON> Lu </PERSON>, an artist from <LOCATION> Hangzhou </LOCATION>, was initially believed to have shot her own work of art, a phone booth, located on the first floor of the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Art Gallery. But <PERSON> Fei </PERSON> said police determined that her boyfriend, <PERSON> Tang </PERSON> <PERSON> Song </PERSON>, actually fired two BBs into the work. Police detained <PERSON> Tang </PERSON> at the show and found Ms. <PERSON> Xiao </PERSON> later. `` What we know now is that they walked into the gallery, she handed him the gun and he shot her artwork,'' he said. `` It was a performance art piece. Together they were attempting to negate modern civilization.'' Modern art has not been popular with the Chinese government because its abstract and chaotic forms did not serve the interests of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Recently, however, the government has allowed exhibitions of once banned art forms, such as nudes, as long as the exhibitions can pay for themselves. Organizers of the avant-garde show have tried for three years to put it together. It was approved last year only after they had raised all the money. The shooting of the phone booth was the last of several performance art pieces done in the gallery in defiance of a ban on such art. <PERSON> Fei </PERSON> said museum officials banned the pieces because they said it might `` cause chaos in society.'' One artist sold shrimp to protest `` the commercialization of art.'' Three others, wrapped from head to toe in white cloth, walked around the gallery. Another took off some of his clothes and began sitting on several eggs. And one strolled around the gallery tossing handful of change and condoms on the floor. Museum officials ordered these artists to stop their performances but none were arrested. Police did confiscate the identity cards of the three who walked around the gallery covered in cloth. <PERSON> Fei </PERSON> said he understood why police were punishing the organizers. `` As organizers, we are responsible,'' he said. `` They are closing the show now because the masses are on vacation and they all want to see it. We will lose a good portion of our spectators this way.'' After the show was closed Sunday, hundreds of spectators and artists spilled into the courtyard in front of the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Art Gallery. At one point, two carloads of riot police, wearing helmets and toting automatic weapons and teargas cannisters, drove into the crowd. They left immediately after their cars were surrounded by curious onlookers. `` That must be performance art, too,'' said one artist. The museum is closed Mondays. The show is scheduled to run to Feb. 19.

 <PERSON> Jethro </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, the mandolin-playing half of the country music duo <PERSON> Homer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jethro </PERSON> who combined cornball humor with brilliant muscianship, has died at age 69. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> died at his <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION> home Saturday night after a long bout with cancer, said his son, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. `` He had a good time, he made a lot of people happy,'' said his sone, also a musician. `` That's what he was all about.'' `` I'm not exactly sure what I do,'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> once said. `` However, lots of folks have said I'm really good at it.'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and guitarist <PERSON> Homer </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>, who died in 1971, gained fame as a hillbilly duo that made fun of popular songs and put on a hayseed music act that also turned out complicated acoustical numbers. Folk singer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Prine </PERSON>, who played with <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> in the late 1970s and early 1980s and now performs with his son, said <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> was known for his musical as well as comedic ability. `` It always seemed to me that he had so much talent _ natural talent _ on the instrument that that's why he was able to joke all the time,'' <PERSON> Prine </PERSON> said. `` He could just pick it up and play it like you never heard anybody play before. ... He just had it.'' Homer and <PERSON> Jethro </PERSON> won a Grammy award for the best comedy performance of 1959 with `` The Battle of <LOCATION> Kookamonga </LOCATION>,'' a parody of the `` The Battle of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>.'' The team also appeared in television commercials for <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON>'s Corn Flakes <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> was a regular on the television show `` Hee-Haw,'' and played many times on the radio program `` A Prairie Home Companion,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said. The duo's most popular album was `` Homer and <PERSON> Jethro </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>,'' a live comedy-music album from the early 1960s. But the work that enjoyed the most recent popularity was an instrumental jazz album from the same era called `` Playing It Straight,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said. `` They became pretty popular because they had this crossover thing, this oddball, cornball kind of thing,'' he said. `` But they wore these $ 300 silk suits _ they were extremely proficient at jazz and swing.'' Homer, whose real name was <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Jethro </PERSON>, whose real name was <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, were boyhood friends in <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, where they began playing music together. Their act took off after World War II, when they became part of the `` Midwestern Hayride'' on a radio station in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, where they worked with such greats as <PERSON> Chet </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON>. Besides his son, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> is survived by his wife, <PERSON> Lois </PERSON>; his daughter, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>; and two grandchildren. Funeral services will be private, the son said.

 <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Novak </PERSON>'s luck catching walleyes won him top prizes in a weekend ice-fishing contest, but the outing turned tragic a few hours later for him and three fellow teen-agers encamped on frozen <LOCATION> Harpt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>. All four were found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning Sunday in the wooden shanty where they had tried to keep warm with propane heaters as temperatures dipped below zero during the weekend contest. `` It was too airtight,'' said <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Koller </PERSON>, whose 16-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>, was among the victims found in the newly built shack. <ORGANIZATION> Mishicot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where all four teen-agers were students, planned to bring in extra counselors and hold a faculty meeting before school today to help other students cope with the tragedy, said Principal <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanhimbergen </PERSON>. `` We're seeing some reaction from kids already,'' he said. <PERSON> Novak </PERSON>, 17, captured first -, second - and third-place in the contest by catching the three largest fish, said <PERSON> August </PERSON> <PERSON> Stueck </PERSON>, a contest His third-place catch was registered with contest officials at 11:50 p.m. Saturday _ less than seven hours before the bodies were found. The teens were overcome by carbon monoxide fumes from two portable propane heaters and a propane hot plate left running in the shanty, said Detective <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jadowski </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Manitowoc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The unpainted 7-foot-by-6 -LCB- - foot wooden shanty was one of more than 50 such shelters on the frozen 70-acre lake about 85 miles north of <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> Temperatures near <ORGANIZATION> Manitowoc </ORGANIZATION> ranged from 16 below and 5 below zero overnight. The victims were identified as <PERSON> Novak </PERSON>, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Koller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cory </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Throndson </PERSON>, 16, and <PERSON> Shawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoulak </PERSON>, 16, said <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON>, a sheriff's department dispatcher `` The cause of death for all four victims was lethal doses of carbon monoxide,'' <PERSON> Jadowski </PERSON> said. `` It's a small ice shanty unit and the carbon monoxide must have filled it.'' Some of the fumes in the shanty also may have come from the corner of a synthetic sleeping bag that brushed against a heater and melted, officials said. Mrs. <PERSON> Koller </PERSON> said the four teen-agers and other friends taking part in the contest had been going from one shanty to another much of the night, checking for possible catches at each tip-up _ an apparatus that holds a hook and line and hoists a flag when a fish bites. She said she had not been worried about her daughter because her husband and 18-year-old son also were on the lake, and she knew her daughter was with her friends and relatives. `` The parents all knew that these kids were out there,'' said <PERSON> Jadowski </PERSON>. `` They were good kids, very fishing - and hunting-oriented, so they had the blessings of their parents and the parents knew exactly where they were. <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, and another friend found the four victims about 6:10 a.m., Mrs. <PERSON> Koller </PERSON> said. `` The girl's father was in the shack right next door. He tried mouth-to-mouth'' resuscitation, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Stueck </PERSON>, another contest organizer. The sporting group observed a moment of silence and members bowed their heads and prayed for the dead teens during the club's award ceremony Sunday night, August <PERSON> Stueck </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Study Finds ABC's `Nightline' Slanted Toward White Conservatives</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON> said he welcomed a study released today that found his late-night news show, `` Nightline,'' favors white conservative men as guests, but he added the report's authors were wrong to criticize the show. The guest list merely reflects the government that `` Nightline'' covers, he said. The study of almost 2,500 guests on more than 850 episodes of the <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> show found that 89 percent were men and 92 percent were white. It also found that the 9-year-old news interview program virtually ignored labor unions, environmental and consumer advocates, anti-war activists, the working class and those who oppose <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy. `` I like studies like this,'' <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON> said. `` I'm happy to see them, whether they are from the right or the left. They do give us an opportunity to re-examine what we do, how we do it. `` And sometimes it's quite true we get into a rut.'' The survey, commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION> liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> watchdog </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fairness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Accuracy In Reporting, was conducted by <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> sociologists <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoynes </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Croteau </PERSON>. `` Nightline,'' which has won two dozen Emmys and is seen by more than 5 million viewers nightly, is widely perceived as one of television's most influential news programs. The findings challenge `` Nightline's'' reputation for impartiality, said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, executive director of FAIR. `` When you see the same pattern week after week, it becomes a political bias,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. Although welcoming the study, <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON> challenged its implications. `` I think FAIR makes a great mistake ... -LRB- when it concludes -RRB- that simply by looking at a guest list, you know what the substance of that program was,'' <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON> said. `` We are accused of putting on the establishment. Yes, we are guilty. That is what we do.'' He said his guest selections simply reflected former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s conservative appointees and that a liberal administration would yield a biased guest record in the opposite political direction. `` What you do is bring on the architects of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy and hold them to account, which is what we try to do on this broadcast,'' <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON> said. `` And never is it suggested that I might ask -LRB- the guests -RRB- a tough question once in a while. Never is it even suggested that if you want to critique <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy, you do n't bring on the opponents of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy and let them speak their minds.'' `` Nightline'' Executive Producer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> also criticized the study, but conceded that it pointed out a narrow focus regarding guests. <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> said he gave copies of the report to his staff. The study examined 40 months of `` Nightline'' episodes from January 1985 to April 1988. The analysis showed that the show's most frequent guests were all conservative leaders. Former secretaries of state <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> topped the list with 14 appearances each, followed by television evangelist <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> with 12 appearances each.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s military chief says the country has test-fired its first homemade long-range surface-to-surface missile and plans to manufacture its own tank within two years, official media reported today. Army Chief of Staff Gen. <PERSON> Mirza </PERSON> <PERSON> Aslam </PERSON> <PERSON> Beg </PERSON> said two missiles with ranges of 50 miles and 180 miles respectively and a capability to carry payloads in excess of 1,000 pounds were tested, the government-controlled <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> Times. Beg reportedly made the disclosure Sunday at a military academy seminar in <LOCATION> Rawalpindi </LOCATION>, and did not say when the missiles were tested. Last summer, western media reports said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> had developed long-range surface-to-surface missiles. At the time, the government refused to confirm or deny those reports. A retired army general who spoke on condition of anonymity said the missile, which now gives <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> the capability to hit Indian targets, represents the evolution of the country's defense systems. `` These things do n't happen suddenly,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported a year ago that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s estranged neighbor, had tested the Prithvi, a short-to-medium range surface-to-surface missile capable of carrying a 2,200-pound warhead more than 90 miles Relations between <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> relations began to warm up with the election last November of Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>. At a December summit of <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> leaders in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, she and Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> signed an agreement not to attack each other's nuclear facilities in accordance with what they said was a new commitment to improved relations. Beg also told the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> should produce its first homemade tank within two years, the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> Times said. The reported announcement came as Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> for crucial talks on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> with Pakistani officials. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are allies. In December, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> gave the ruling Communists in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> long-range Scud missiles capable of hitting targets 100-175 miles away. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which has 3 million refugees from the Afghan war, has supported the U.S.-backed Afghan guerrillas who have been fighting the Soviet-supported government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> since Marxists seized power there in 1978.

<HEAD>15 Million Hindus Wash Away Sins At Giant Festival</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DILIP GANGULY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALLAHABAD, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An estimated 15 million Hindus _ holy men from their Himalayan cave homes, naked recluses from forest dens and ordinary pilgrims from across <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> _ began immersing themselves at the confluence of two sacred rivers today. Today's bathing is the high point of the seven-week <PERSON> Kumbh </PERSON> <PERSON> Mela </PERSON> festival, which according to the <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> is the largest religious gathering on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. The ceremonial bathing began at 4 a.m. with the blowing of conch shells and the chanting of hymns by the faithful, who believe a dip in the rivers on this astrologically auspicious day will free them from the cycle of reincarnation and allow them to achieve salavation. Hindus believe that <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Brahma </PERSON>, creator of the world in the Hindu religion and a member of the supreme trinity in the pantheon of <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION> gods, awakens at 4 a.m. and therefore the day should start at that hour. The <PERSON> Kumbh </PERSON> <PERSON> Mela </PERSON> is celebrated every 12 years, according to the lunar calendar, at the time of a rare planetary convergence: Jupiter in Taurus, the sun and moon in <LOCATION> Capricorn </LOCATION>, and a series of complicated calculations of Hindu astrology. But today takes on added significance, for it is also the day of the new moon, another good omen. Two people died in the early hours of the mass bathing. A 50-year-old man collapsed on the river bank after his bath and soon died, and a woman drowned when her boat capsized, according to a police officer who spoke on condition of anonymity. In 1954, about 800 pilgrims died in a stampede at the holy festival. `` Either these people are crazy or there must be something we ca n't see or understand,'' said <PERSON> Nina </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, a 23-year-old student from <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> who was among dozens of Americans that came to see the religious spectacle. `` It is vibrating,'' she said, pointing to the barefoot pilgrims trekking to the junction of the Ganges and <LOCATION> Jamuna </LOCATION> rivers. For the faithful, the bathing is often a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. `` I planned this trip five years back when we had a good crop,'' said <PERSON> Sarju </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahato </PERSON>, a farmer from <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> state, as he tended the blisters on his two sons' feet. `` We saved money and came here.'' The festival takes the name <PERSON> Kumbh </PERSON> <PERSON> Mela </PERSON> from a story in Hindu mythology in which a god seized a pot of nectar that made gods invincible in their war against the demons. `` Kumbh'' means pot, and `` mela'' means fair. A drop of nectar from the pot is thought to have fallen at <LOCATION> Allahabad </LOCATION> where the <LOCATION> Ganges </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jamuna </PERSON> rivers come together. A bath at the exact spot where the nectar fell is supposed to bring salvation from the cycle of birth and rebirth. The bathing at the <PERSON> Kumbh </PERSON> <PERSON> Mela </PERSON> began with processions of holy men, their order determined from days of yore according to the importance of their sects, dipping at the confluence of the <LOCATION> Ganges </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Yamuna </LOCATION> and the mythical Swaraswati. The Swaraswati can not be seen, but Hindus believe it flows beneath the Earth's surface where the two other rivers meet. There was color everywhere _ a profusion of saffron, scarlet, white and gold robes. Some holy men wore only loincloths. Some had their foreheads smeared with vermilion and sandalwood paste, and some wore garlands of basil wreaths around their necks, wrists and arms. Some had shaven heads, others matted hair tied in knots atop their heads. The `` nagas,'' or naked recluses, smeared their bodies with ashes. They wore garlands of marigolds around their necks and blew conch shells to drive away evil spirits. They danced holding spears, lances, staffs and small rocks representing some of the Hindu faith's 32 million gods and goddesses. There were camels draped in brightly embroidered cloths, adorned with feathers, beads and mirrors, with bells on their feet that tinkled when they walked. Some pilgrims pulled chariots holding the holiest of the holy men, who offered blessings to the others. The bathing followed the initiation of new nagas. Young men are inducted into the naked order only once every 12 years during the <PERSON> Kumbh </PERSON> <PERSON> Mela </PERSON>. On Sunday, 1,500 nagas-to-be shaved their heads, burned their clothing and performed their last rites. `` From this moment they have renounced the material world and since they will not depend on anyone anymore, they themselves perform their last rites as if they are already dead from this world,'' explained M.P. Ashnata, the fair's chief spokesman.

The Kowalskis say Ms. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> exaggerates their daughter's ability to communicate and her potential for rehabilitation. Ms. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, 41, was allowed to see Miss <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON>, 32, under an order from <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>. The judge has consistently upheld <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON>'s guardianship rights, but in December he overruled <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> by ordering a re-evaluaton of Miss <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> to determine how soundly she thinks and what her potential is to express her feelings about who should care for her. According to the judge's order, anyone would be allowed to see her if she `` reliably requested'' to see them. Ms. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> was granted supervised visits because Miss <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> `` reliably'' requested to see her in interviews with a psychiatrist, Ms. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. `` It's really good to have private time with <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> again,'' she said. `` I think <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> is soon going to let everyone know that she can control her own future.'' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> said he was angered that <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> was allowed to visit his daughter. `` It's just not right what they're doing but there's nothing I can do,'' <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> said. `` She -LRB- <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> -RRB- has been proven harmful to <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>. `` I do n't believe <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> reliably wants to see <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>.''

 The dollar rose in early European trading today after last week's meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> industrialized countries failed to break the market's bullish sentiment, foreign currency dealers said. Gold prices also rose. Trading was thin, as Chinese New Year celebrations in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and carnival celebrations in parts of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> kept many operators out of the market, dealers said. They said the market is ready to buy dollars because inconclusive comments from the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> industrialized countries in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> did not convince it to do otherwise. However, they said, the general bullishness is dampened by fears that central banks might stage another round of concerted interventions. `` The central banks have failed to reverse the trend, all they can do is slow down the momentum,'' said one dealer at a Swiss bank in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. `` The market's inclination to take in dollars is still very strong.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.43 yen to close at 129.70. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 129.85 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday: _ 1.8855 West German marks, up from 1.8805 _ 1.6015 Swiss francs, up from 1.5983 _ 6.4135 French francs, up from 6.3950 _ 2.1302 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1240 _ 1,376.40 Italian lire, up from 1,374.50 _ $ 1.1837 Canadian, down from $ 1.1885 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound cost $ 1.7317, cheaper for buyers than Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 390.65 a troy ounce, up from $ 388.25 bid late Friday. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 390.25. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 390.30, up from $ 389.90 bid late Friday. Financial markets were closed in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> today for the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday. They will reopen on Thursday.

 A convoy of Soviet troops roared home today from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to a brass-band reception, waving flags and stuffing red carnations into the muzzles of their submachine guns to mark the end of their country's involvement in the war. The 350th Parachute Regiment, which had been stationed in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> since 1984, rumbled across the Friendship Bridge spanning the <LOCATION> Amu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and into <LOCATION> Termez </LOCATION>, red flags waving and headlights lit. Soviet officials brought about 150 foreign correspondents to this border town in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> for the welcoming ceremonies, or one for every two soldiers who returned. The 300 paratroopers, commanded by Lt. Col. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Skachkov </PERSON>, were presented with red carnations, which they pushed down the barrels of the weapons on their armored vehicles and into the muzzles of their guns. A 20-piece military band played the national anthem and martial airs. The tanks, armored personnel carriers and armored cars that carried the returning soldiers held banners proclaiming `` Peace to you, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'' and `` The order of the fatherland has been fulfilled.'' Among the hundreds of <LOCATION> Termez </LOCATION> residents to meet the returning airborne regiment was <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabriba </PERSON>, who found her grandson, <PERSON> Eldar </PERSON> <PERSON> Galiev </PERSON>, in its ranks. The diminutive woman's face lit up as she told reporters she had seen her grandson. She said he had written a letter saying he was in <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> rather than <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> so that she would n't worry about him. `` At least he's healthy,'' she said, beaming. The convoy was one of the last rolling north to the border as the Soviets extricate themselves from their more than nine-year involvement in the Afghan war. Under a U.N.-brokered accord signed last year, all Soviet troops are to be withdrawn from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Feb. 15. The Kremlin intervened in 1979 to prop up the Marxist government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, but its troops fought to a costly stalemate. The Soviets say more than 13,000 Red Army soldiers were killed in the conflict and many troops and veterans express anger and frustration at the outcome. <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Sudarenkov </PERSON>, first deputy prime minister of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>, welcomed the soldiers home, saying: `` We wish you to join the front ranks of those fighting for revolutionary change'' in Soviet society. But as the convoy logged its last miles in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on Sunday, soldiers expressed ambivalence about the purpose of their military intervention and uncertainty about the shaky pro-Soviet government they left behind. `` The Soviet policy in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> brought nothing,'' said tank commander <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Yevryolin </PERSON>, speaking to foreign reporters who rode for an hour atop his tank. At a military outpost near the northern Afghan city of <LOCATION> Mazar-i-Sharif </LOCATION>, 30-year-old Capt. <PERSON> Arkady </PERSON> <PERSON> Anonich </PERSON> bluntly answered `` No'' when asked if he thought the local people supported the government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. He told journalists the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to send soldiers to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> had been `` ill-considered. `` There should have been another way to settle this conflict,'' he said.

<HEAD>Proposed Denver Airport Still Having Problem Getting Off The Ground</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A proposed $ 3 billion airport, which survived one election and appeared ready to fly last spring, has run into turbulence again. The new airport, which would be the first such major project planned in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> opened in 1974, is again the subject of debate, and faces the threat of a second referendum. Meanwhile, federal investigators are looking into the dealings of some land developers associated with the project. `` I am frustrated with this state and this community not getting its act together. We can debate ourselves to the tail end of the line,'' said Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON>. `` My frustration with the city of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> is, for God's sake, you've been working on this for seven years and sent me and some others out to represent you to a neighboring county -LRB- <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> -RRB- and then, whoops, the rug came out from under us.'' <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> and other proponents, including <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON>, contend the airport, scheduled for a July groundbreaking, will ease a projected national air transportation crush and boost <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s sagging economy <LOCATION> Stapleton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> is too small and has a flawed runway design, they say. Opponents, including the two major airlines that serve <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, have called the new airport a waste of money engineered by `` fat cats,'' and point to declining traffic at <LOCATION> Stapleton </LOCATION> in the last two years. The squabbling could cost the city federal funds that would help build the airport. The city has asked the federal government for $ 500 million to help offset the estimated $ 1.7 billion cost of the first phase of construction. <LOCATION> Adams </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> voters agreed last May to annex land northeast of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> to the city for the airport. <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> ordered a national advertising campaign that boasted, `` The world's largest airport is now off the ground,'' and promised the new airport would be operational by the mid-1990s. Three months later, the city sued <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> airlines for judicial approval to use <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> revenue to help finance the new airport. And then in January, former <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> and former state Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Chenoweth </PERSON> spoke out against the city's plans, reviving the opposition and threatening to start a petition drive to put the issue to a vote. A newspaper poll showed most residents favored a second referendum. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the decision to build the new airport instead of expanding <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> was made `` in the closed rooms and the boardrooms and the hidden rooms, by the people who are going to make the money off what I consider the greatest boondoggle of all time.'' At the heart of the investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is an alleged cash payment of $ 2,500 to former <LOCATION> Adams </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON> from a developer weeks before <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON> helped rezone a key parcel of land near the new site. <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON> denied receiving the payment, and said the decision-making that went into the airport plan was too complex to be manipulated. The <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> has scheduled a Feb. 21 vote on whether to endorse the new airport. The airport ultimately will need approval from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which also would provide federal funding. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has supported construction of the new airport to help ease future crowding in the nation's transportation system. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> released a draft environmental impact statement last week that approved the new airport based on <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> findings. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said it still had some reservations about the new site, including the possibility of increased air pollution. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials said they expected to issue a final environmental impact statement this summer, and will decide before then whether to approve <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s airport layout plans.

 Frigid air cloaked the nation today, turning highways into icy demolition derby courses, leaving snow in unlikely places and forcing a camp of nudists in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to decide they could n't bare it. The arctic front that spilled out of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> last week remained stalled over virtually the entire nation, forcing temperatures below normal just about everywhere but <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Forecasters said relief is at least several days away. In <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, churches canceled Sunday services to spare worshipers the danger of traveling on icy roads. Public schools throughout central and northern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, as well as at least two <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> colleges, canceled classes today for the same reason. The weather has contributed to at least 40 deaths in the lower 48 states since the air spread from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> on Tuesday. Among the latest victims were three people killed Sunday night on icy roads in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and a man who froze to death beneath a freeway overpass in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> earlier in the day. Accidents on slick roads also were blamed for four deaths in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, including two people who died when an 18-wheel truck spun out of control on an icy bridge just east of <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> and rammed their vehicles. In addition, four teen-agers competing in a <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> ice-fishing derby were found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning Sunday after they left propane heaters running overnight in a wooden shanty. The overnight temperature near frozen <LOCATION> Harpt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> was about 16 below zero. A <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> boy died at a Grand Junction, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, hospital late Sunday after being trapped beneath an avalanche earlier in the day. Two other boys were buried but managed to escape from the snowslide at <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crested </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Butte </ORGANIZATION> in the central Rockies. At 2 a.m. EST today, the nation's low was minus 44 degrees at <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Colo </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>'s 29 degrees early today broke a 90-year-old record for the date and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s 35 degrees shattered a 100-year-old record. Elsewhere, it was 1 degree in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and Minneapolis-St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, 5 in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, 6 in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION> and 8 in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> On Sunday, low temperature records were reached in at least 26 cities, from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> to the Plains. In <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, it was 24 below zero, the city's coldest temperature in 26 years. At 1 p.m., the thermometer crept to 1 degree, breaking a 70-hour streak of subzero cold. The nation's low Sunday was 46 below zero at Wisdom, <PERSON> Mont </PERSON>. It was minus 21 at <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and parts of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area remained coated in snow, astonishing longtime residents. `` You could only find a scene like this on a postcard,'' said <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Waters </PERSON>, a 77-year-old ranch resident at the <ORGANIZATION> Point </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reyes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seashore </ORGANIZATION> just north of the Golden Gate. `` It's just extraordinarily beautiful. Our family ca n't remember snow like this in 40 years.'' Persistent snow in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> forced the temporary closure of <LOCATION> Midway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and the closure of two runways at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, causing 40 flight cancellations and numerous delays. `` It just wo n't stop,'' complained <PERSON> Kirsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Svare </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s Department of Streets and Sanitation. `` It just keeps coming.'' Cool, drizzly weather in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> did n't stop 11 scheduled <PERSON> Mardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gras </PERSON> parades, but it did contribute to sales of hot drinks in Bourbon Street bars. `` Thank God it did get a little bit colder,'' said <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>, manager of the Seaport Bar. `` As soon as it rained, it pushed everyone inside.'' Freezing rain was reported early today across the Eastern seaboard from <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, and south and west across <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, northern <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and into the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and central <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, 60 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, members of the <ORGANIZATION> Bluebonnet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nudist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> could n't keep their clothes off Sunday as temperatures were in the teens and low 20s. `` Unfortunately, we nudists have to put it on hold for a few days,'' said manager <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Moss </PERSON>. `` As nudists, we're generally a sensible lot.'' Nudists and sensible conformists will be bundling up for at least the next few days, according to <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Severe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Storms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forecast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. However, he added, storms brewing in the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> could spell relief of sorts for the rest of the country later in the week. If the storms begin to push north and east, they could bring more seasonable temperatures to the middle of the country, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said, but they also would bring more snow or rain. As <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> of the weather service in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> said: `` Who knows? ... When it snows it snows, and when it does n't, it does n't.''

<TEXT>
 Former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, busy lining up work and visiting old haunts since leaving office two weeks ago, is celebrating his 78th birthday today with a talk to college students and a private party. He planned to detail his retirement plans during a 20-minute speech at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> _ his first public appearance since a spirited airport homecoming rally Jan. 20. Tonight, he planned to celebrate his birthday with his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, and about 100 friends at a private party at the ritzy <LOCATION> Bistro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION> restaurant in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. `` The change of address has n't caused any slowing down of their schedule,'' said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>. `` They are very active and on the go.'' The former president has already signed a book deal worth up to $ 7 million, lined up a $ 50,000-per-speech lecture contract and opened his <LOCATION> Century </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> offices, where a variety of offers are pouring in. Social demands include a Feb. 23 <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> gala honoring <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and a private welcome home dinner Feb. 25. About 200 friends will toast the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> return at Syrian-born businessman's Mouaffak <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Midani </PERSON>'s secluded nine-acre <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> estate. <PERSON> Midani </PERSON> has expressed interest in Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s anti-drug crusade, <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON> said, and money is still needed for a proposed <ORGANIZATION> Nancy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for drug rehabilitation in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. So far, the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> have shunned the reclusive lifestyle of many celebrities and have ventured away from their <LOCATION> Bel-Air </LOCATION> home to dine at upscale <ORGANIZATION> Chasen </ORGANIZATION>'s, attend Sunday church services or visit friends. <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents drive <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> the five miles from his $ 2.5 million hillside home to <LOCATION> Century </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where he takes a private elevator to his office suite and spends about six hours daily at his desk. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is reportedly fielding corporate board membership offers from <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION>. He also is being sought for radio, television and motion pictures, although longtime friend <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> `` Swifty'' <PERSON> Lazar </PERSON> dismissed as `` ridiculous'' the possibility that the former actor would make a cinematic comeback. Currently, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s memoirs are his top priority. The ex-president promised his <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Schuster book would be `` an honest and straightforward look at where we have been, with some thoughts on where we're going.''

<HEAD>Klanwatch Report Says Skinheads Revive White Supremacist Movement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A rise in racist violence by young `` skinheads'' shows that `` hate crime is a bigger problem than we ever suspected,'' the head of a national monitoring group says. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, the director of <ORGANIZATION> Klanwatch </ORGANIZATION>, said skinheads helped revive the white supremacist movement in 1988. A report released by her group today said white youth gangs attacked blacks, homosexuals, Jews, Asians, Hispanics and Indians last year. Blacks were victims of 56 percent of the hate crimes reported to <ORGANIZATION> Klanwatch </ORGANIZATION> in 1988; Jews were victims of 27 percent. The other 17 percent fell into other categories, the report said. The report also said skinheads were linked to murders in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, and two-thirds of the racial assaults documented by <ORGANIZATION> Klanwatch </ORGANIZATION> last year. Klanwatch monitors white supremacist activities for the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poverty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. The report gives a representative sample of hate crimes during 1988, including 193 incidents in 35 states. But statistics in the report are incomplete since no national data collection system exists, said Ms. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. She said the lack of national data has tended to disguise the threat of violence. However, she said, `` the tremendous rise in skinhead crime, as well as the evidence from states who do have data collection laws, clearly shows hate crime is a bigger problem than we ever suspected.'' The report cited a growing recruitment campaign by white supremacist groups. Old guard racists are organizing violent teen gangs into a national network, the report said. Although many skinheads reject racism, a hard-core group openly espouses white supremacy and violence. `` Not since the height of Klan activity during the civil rights era has there been a white supremacist group so obsessed with violence or so reckless in its disregard for the law,'' according to the report. In the slayings in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, black men were killed by assailants who apparently picked their victims at random, the report said. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Klanwatch </ORGANIZATION> said, a 24-year-old white man was fatally stabbed when he attempted to step between a skinhead and a black man at a party after the skinhead began making racial slurs. In <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, two skinheads who shared an obsession with Satanism walked into a convenience store and fatally shot the 21-year-old clerk in the face for no apparent reason, the report said. It added that the racist gangs `` represent a unique and frightening phenomenon in the history of white supremacism in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' `` Police in urban areas around the country were confronted last year with a violent new generation of racists whose weapons include baseball bats and their own heavy steel-toed boots, and whose crimes ranged from gang beatings to murder,'' Ms. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said today his talks with Pakistani officials failed to come up with a solution for peacefully ending the Afghan war, but he said Soviet soldiers would not re-enter the battle. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> also told a news conference before leavng for the airport that his visit helped pave the way for a continuing dialogue with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has backed Moslem rebels fighting <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Soviet-backed government. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> spoke as the last <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> units were reported on their way home after nine years of involvement in the civil war between the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government and the guerrillas, who call themselves mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors. Under a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> accord, all Soviet troops are to be out of the country by Feb. 15. Contrary to reports from guerrilla sources, who said Sunday the Soviet official would meet with the Pakistani-based guerrillas, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said no such meeting occurred. Asked why not, he said: `` I never expressed any desire, any request to meet with the mujahedeen. There was no request from their side, either.'' He said any attempt to form a stable government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> following the Soviet troop withdrawal would fail if it does n't include the Marxists `` Whether you like it or not, the <ORGANIZATION> PDPA </ORGANIZATION> is the most powerful force in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> also pledged <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s continued support of the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government but he ruled out any reintroduction of Soviet troops. `` If new complications happen, if there is continued and rising tension, ... we will have to recall that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has obligations to the Republic of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said. He added: `` We are not thinking of any Soviet re-entry into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the last <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops would be out of the country within a week. The communists seized power in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in a 1978 coup. Soviet forces intervened in 1979 to replace one pro-Moscow government with another, then remained to fight the growing insurgency by Moslem guerrillas. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s visit, the first to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> by a Soviet of his rank, was seen as a last-ditch effort to forge a political solution to the war before the Soviet pullout. Afghan President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> has insisted his forces are strong and able to defend the country. However, the rebels claim <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s mainly conscripted army is demoralized and will defect to the rebels in large numbers once the Soviets are gone. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, who arrived early Sunday, had talks with his Pakistani counterpart, <PERSON> Sahabzada </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaqub </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, as well as Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Report: Profits from Parties Did Not Reach Charities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professionals </ORGANIZATION> has staged eight fund-raising parties in the last 18 months but often failed to donate the profits to the charities in whose name the parties were conducted, according to a published report. The society, a loose-knit group of stockbrokers, lawyers and other professionals, is under investigation by Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> after two charities complained they had received no money, the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported. A <ORGANIZATION> Suffolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge ordered a bank account for the society frozen last week, but there was no money in that account, according to Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Joanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Soris </PERSON>, who is handling the case. The eight parties grossed up to $ 75,000, but the amount donated to charity was $ 3,565, or about 5 percent of the gross proceeds, the newspaper reported. `` Our concern is to break even, and if we have any money left over, we give it to charity,'' <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Southmayd </PERSON>, 29, who heads the society, told the paper. There was no answer at Southmayd's home Sunday. The attorney general's investigation is still in the discovery process, and <PERSON> Soris </PERSON> said no decision has been made yet as to whether statements for the bank account should be subpoenaed. `` It's not our goal to chill charitable giving,'' said <PERSON> Soris </PERSON>. But a charitable party, she said, `` should be a cooperative effort. And you have to have the charity's interest first.'' Hundreds of young professional singles flocked to the parties, which were billed as benefits for charities including the Jimmy Fund, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Olympic Swim Team, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, and the Pine Street Inn. Businesses also donated drinks and hotel rooms on the assumption that proceeds from the functions would go to charity, the newspaper reported. A benefit party for the Special Olympics last month raised $ 1,300 for the charity, but only after a Boston-based Special Olympics official, <PERSON> Karyl </PERSON> <PERSON> Resnick </PERSON>, threatened the society with legal action. <PERSON> Resnick </PERSON> called the society's methods `` underhanded.'' She said: `` They were n't on the up-and-up with us. People were thinking they made a donation to a charity when in fact they were paying for these people to have a big shindig.'' The party had promised the opportunity to meet such stars as former <PERSON> Bruin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> and former Yankee <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Resnick </PERSON> said, `` there was not one celebrity there.'' At a Super Bowl party held last month to benefit the Pine Street Inn, only 105 of the 250 guests paid admission, the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> said. The event grossed $ 3,225 but expenses were $ 6,000, resulting in a net loss of $ 2,775, the newspaper said. The Quality Inn donated a room worth $ 2,000 and a $ 600 drinks discount for the party, on the assumption that proceeds would benefit the <ORGANIZATION> Pine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inn </ORGANIZATION>, said the hotel's food and beverage director, <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>. However the Pine Street Inn has received no donation, the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> said. The Pine Street Inn and the American Cancer Society were not informed in advance that their names would be used for the events, the newspaper said. Public charities law forbids the unauthorized use of a charity's name in connection with any solicitation.

In the statement, both leaders said they support a Vietnamese troop pullout from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by September, with `` strict international supervision'' and an end to <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s anti-Vietnamese guerrillas They said they still differed over the composition of a transitional government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> from the current Vietnamese-installed <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> regime to a popularly elected government. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said the two sides will continue to discuss their differences. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> apparently considers the Cambodian problem close enough to resolution to go ahead with a Chinese-Soviet summit. One of its conditions for a summit has been a Vietnamese withdrawal from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> after a decade of occupation.

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Greek and American officials today began another round of talks on the future of four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases here. The officials refused comment on the start of the four-day talks, the 14th since negotiations began in late 1987. Little progress has been made in the negotiations. A five-year operating agreement for the installations expired December 20. Under terms of the old accord, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has 17 months to reach a new agreement or dismantle the bases. Government spokesman <PERSON> Sotiris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostopoulos </PERSON> said at the end of last month's talks that negotiators were no further than the `` preamble'' stage of a new accord and that a `` disagreement of views continues to be observable.'' The resignation last week of Rear Adm. <PERSON> Christos </PERSON> <PERSON> Limberis </PERSON> from the Greek negotiating team was expected to create further delays until his replacement is found. <PERSON> Limberis </PERSON>, chief of naval operations, is being groomed to take over as naval chief of staff, military sources said. Another reason for the slow pace is the socialist government's insistence that a new agreement provide assurances the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will help solve the country's disputes with <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> The two neighboring <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> members have been at odds over military control of the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> sea </LOCATION>, its seabed mineral rights and the <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> problem. American officials have said they do n't want to involve regional politics in the bilateral talks. Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, beset by a series of embarassing financial scandals, is also expected to use the bases issue to attract leftist votes in the June elections. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> has already said he plans to shut down one of the bases adjacent to <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and hold a referendum on the remaining installations. Four major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases have been operating here since the early 1950s. Two are near <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> and two are on the island of <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION>.

 Five East Germans fled to <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> over the weekend, but a sixth person who tried to escape over the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall was caught after border guards opened fire, West German police said today.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The president of the teachers' union said he would recommend a strike vote this week because contract talks with the nation's second-largest school district are at a standstill. `` It was an absolute waste of time,'' said <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers-Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION>, after eight hours of negotiations ended Sunday night. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said the talks narrowed differences on pay hikes but failed to solve the escalating labor dispute. State mediator <PERSON> Draza </PERSON> <PERSON> Mrvichin </PERSON> had brought representatives from the union and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Unified School District together at noon Sunday in hopes of settling the labor dispute, which is beginning to be felt by the district's nearly 600,000 pupils. Talks broke off at midevening. Teachers have been working without a contract since June. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said union members would vote on a strike this week and predicted a strike was imminent. But he was not specific on the timing of any possible strike, which would be the first in the city since 1970. The stalemate has triggered student protests and threats of lawsuits by parents. On Friday, teachers withheld thousands of student grades from the district, passing them out instead on union report cards. Negotiations are scheduled to resume Wednesday. Teachers had sought a 12 percent pay raise this year, while the district offered a 17.4 percent hike over three years. During the talks, the union offered to reduce its 1988-89 school year salary increase demand from 12 percent to 11 percent for the year, with a 10 percent hike next school year. The district, meanwhile, raised its offer to 20 percent over three years, and possibly as much as 24 percent, with an 8 percent increase the first year, officials said. Board President <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Weintraub </PERSON> said the board's new offer would raise beginning teachers' salaries to $ 28,000. Top pay would be $ 50,000. `` As far as I can see, it's our last offer. I ca n't see anything beyond this,'' she said.

 <PERSON> Ernestine </PERSON> <PERSON> Morais </PERSON> and her classmates were having as much fun grabbing for beads as anyone at the Carnival parade. But they came for a serious lesson. `` This is one of our biggest confidence builders. <PERSON> Mardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gras </PERSON> is the ultimate,'' said <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Center for the Blind. `` If you can travel through a Mardi Gras crowd, you can go through any crowd and you can go to any place.'' And even though they could n't see the gaudy floats or the plastic beads and aluminum doubloons thrown from them, the members of her group were having a blast. `` It's a lot of fun. Time just to cut loose and anything goes,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Morais </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has nothing on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. We look like we're throwing a tea party compared to down here.'' The 15 students and seven staff members were among thousands braving the cold weather Sunday for the 11 parades that rolled through the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> area. Crowds surged into the French Quarter between parades, ready to rock on Bourbon Street. Bar and restaurant owners said the chilly weather was helping them by pushing people indoor. Police expect this will be the city's biggest <LOCATION> Mardi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gras </LOCATION>, with 1.7 million revelers lining the streets and jamming the French Quarter on Fat Tuesday, the last blowout before the solemn season of Lent. Authorities said 1.5 million people attended the 1988 celebrations. One reveler was killed early today, shot by robbers when he refused to give up his money, police said. The man was from <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, but his name was not immediately released. He was shot about 1 a.m. in the city's central business district and died later at Charity Hospital. Police were seeking three men who witnesses said fled the robbery scene in a car. Despite a misty fog Sunday, the crowd was 10 deep for the popular Bacchus parade, led by comedian <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Crystal </PERSON> as this year's god of wine and revelry. He threw handfuls of aluminum doubloons to the sea of arms waving beseechingly below, stopping only to pull out a video camera to shoot pictures of the crowd. It was cloudy and drizzling with temperatures in the 40s, and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> predicted slightly colder temperatures for today and Tuesday. Two parades compete tonight with fireworks as <PERSON> Rex </PERSON>, styled King of Carnival by one of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>' oldest parading groups, arrives by riverboat in the French Quarter. The long Carnival celebration began Saturday, highlighted by the `` super parade'' of Endymion with celebrity riders _ singers <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Oates </PERSON> and child television star <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> of `` The Wonder Years'' _ on floats. During the weekend parades, three people were injured, but not seriously, authorities said.

<TEXT>
 Fewer firecrackers than past years lit <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s smoggy sky to greet the Year of the Snake early today, but city residents did n't stint on traditional feasting and drinking People jammed stores over the weekend, preparing for the Lunar New Year which the communist government dubs Spring Festival in an effort to rid the holiday of traditional superstitions. The Year of the Snake, for example, is regarded as unpredictable because the reptile is considered cunning. As the clock struck midnight, colored rockets and sparklers burst from every street. The cacaphony lasted half an hour, but it was only a dim echo of fireworks fusillades of the past, which went on for hours. The government sharply cut back the fireworks supply this year, allocating 30 percent less to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to try to reduce fires and accidents. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> also banned firecrackers from central Tiananmen Square and hundreds of other public locations. <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> banned them altogether from the downtown area. Lunar New Year is <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s combination of Christmas and New Year's: a time for visiting family, feasting, giving gifts and reflection. Last year, the Year of the Dragon, brought the highest inflation in more than three decades, the country's worst drought in memory and the most deadly earthquake since the last dragon year, 1976. Top officials are using Spring Festival parties to deliver pep talks about <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economic woes. President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON> urged a tea party of 1,700 army officers in eastern <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> to `` join hands with the -LRB- Communist -RRB- party, government and civilians in overcoming difficulties <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has encountered in its ongoing reform.'' Transport officials estimate 800 million train and plane trips will be made over the four-day holiday period that started Sunday. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> railway officials this year decided to entertain the hundreds of travelers likely to be stuck in the train station New Year's Eve, waiting for connecting trains or unable to get tickets. Travelers crowded around appreciatively to watch singers and comedians perform in the cavernous station's entry hall. `` We make this trip every year, but usually we get an earlier start,'' said a man traveling with his wife, daughter and four other relatives to the southwestern city of <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION>. They sat surrounded by bags of provisions for the 36-hour train ride in a hard-seat car, followed by a two-hour bus ride and daylong hike to his parents' rural mountain home. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said millions of viewers spent Sunday night watching a four-hour television extravaganza featuring top singers, comedians and dancers. `` The evening party on the screen has become an indispensable item for about 600 million <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people,'' it said.

 Representatives of Solidarity and the government today began unprecedented talks on the future of the trade union movement and changes in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s political system. Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> led his 25-member delegation into the conference hall and grinned as he took his seat at the round, pine table. Just before 2 p.m., Polish television began a special live broadcast to show the 57 representatives of the government, Solidarity, the official trade union OPZZ, the <ORGANIZATION> Peasants </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> taking their seats in the Namiestnikowski palace. `` We were brought together here by the sense of responsibility for the future of our motherland. We are all responsible for the <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to be,'' Interior Minister Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> told the participants, the state-run <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said the talks officially began at 2:23 p.m., when television concluded its coverage. The talks are the first between Solidarity as an organization and the government since the union was suppressed by the martial law crackdown in December 1981. It was outlawed a year later. Official representatives included <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, Politburo member <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciosek </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON>, the leader of the official trade union alliance OPZZ. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was accompanied by his close adviser, <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Wladyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Frasyniuk </PERSON>, the Solidarity leader in the southwestern city of <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said earlier he was optimistic about the talks. `` I'm happy I'm in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. And I will be even more happy if we break the first ice. ... I'm an optimist,'' he said. `` Today, we will discuss general problems, but solutions to the main problems will be made at the technical tables.'' <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> first proposed the talks in August 1988, while strikes spread across <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in the country's worst labor unrest in seven years. The crucial issues concern the reinstatement of Solidarity and electoral reforms that could allow the opposition representation in government. `` We would like Solidarity to be legalized as quickly as possible and we would like it done all at once,'' said historian <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON>, a Solidarity delegate to the talks. Solidarity actvists remain skeptical about the outcome of the talks and reluctant to accept a political role. Both sides agree that compromise is urgently needed if the Poles are to extract themselves from end an economic crisis that has spawned 60 percent inflaction and chronic consumer shortages. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is trying to cope with a $ 39 billion foreign debt, an obsolete industrial base and the exodus of many talented young people to the West. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> met six times to set up the talks, but <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> refused to commit Solidarity until authorities agreed to legalize the union. In a dramatic reversal of its stand against the movement it banned in 1982, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last month approved a plan to conditionally reinstate Solidarity. The union movement's leaders then agreed to take part in the talks. Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> has suggested Solidarity observe a strike moratorium as part of the agreement to legalize the union. `` We wo n't abandon the right to strike, but we declare Solidarity will search at any cost to avoid strikes,'' <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> said. `` We accept that conflict must be avoided, but we can not accept it at the loss of our identity.'' The authorities have signaled a willingness to allow representatives of the `` constructive opposition'' to run for parliament, but the opposition does not believe that the Communists have any intention of sharing power. Hence, opposition leaders say they would be reluctant to run for parliament or accept Cabinet posts. `` The party demands Solidarity be a trade union, but it insists Solidarity become politically engaged,'' <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> said. `` The key problem on the elections will be between those who want to reproduce their power and those who want free elections.'' Solidarity also says it wants to discuss reform of the legal system to create a more independent judiciary, freedom of clubs and associations, access to the mass media, democratization of local government at smaller round tables. Both sides have expressed the desire to conclude the talks quickly.

 A truck driver with the rock group <PERSON> Bon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jovi </PERSON> was shot once during a drug deal that apparently turned bad, police said today. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullin </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Churchville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, was treated and released at <ORGANIZATION> Tallahassee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said Sgt. <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. `` It was not life-threatening,'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. According to the account police said <PERSON> Mullin </PERSON> gave them, he was searching for some marijuana shortly after 9 p.m. Sunday when a man offered to sell him some crack cocaine near the <LOCATION> Tallahassee-Leon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Civic Center, where the rock group had had a performance. He refused, the apparently disgruntled dealer asked `` What do you want?'', produced a handgun and began shooting. Five shots hit the semi-tractor <PERSON> Mullin </PERSON> was driving, one penetrating the driver's door and hitting <PERSON> Mullin </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. `` As he was backing out, he heard about five shots. He said he felt numb in his left side, but he was in such a hurry to get out he did n't think about it,'' the police sergeant said. <PERSON> Mullin </PERSON> then returned to the civic center and contacted police. He had a minor wound in the buttocks. No charges were expected against the driver, even though <PERSON> Mullin </PERSON> could have been charged with solicitation to commit a felony, said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. `` In this situation, I want to say it would be pouring salt into his wound, but he's learned his lesson,'' he said. When officers were sent to check out the parking lot where the shooting occurred, no one could be found.

Hope, 48, is an attorney specializing in transportation law for the Los Angeles-based firm of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, <PERSON> Janofsky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. She is the daughter-in-law of comedian <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>. She met her husband, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. Hope, while both were students at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in the early 1960s, and they have a son who is a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> sophomore. The appointment was reported in today's <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crimson </ORGANIZATION>, the school's student newspaper.

<TEXT>
 The Energy Department is privately urging energy companies to take extra precautions against terrorism, in part out of concern that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> might strike at key <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> energy facilities. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> has created a special interagency task force to assess the vulnerability of domestic energy systems and to study possible <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> responses to a wide variety of energy emergencies at home and abroad. `` Energy-related terrorism in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be a particularly significant threat'' in a military crisis involving the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, said an internal <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` However, even in the absence of a superpower confrontation, there is the possibility that potential Third World adversaries could sponsor attacks on the energy infrastructure in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' the report said. The report was prepared in December 1987 to describe the early stages of the department's accelerated effort to improve national energy security. It was deemed too sensitive to make public, although a sanitized version was presented to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year, and a similarly limited edition was published last month. Electric power companies, considered the most vulnerable segment of the energy industry, have begun acting on the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s anti-terrorism warnings, according to sources familiar with ongoing discussions between industry and government But other energy businesses, including the oil industry, have been reluctant to join the program, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The report said a natural disaster such as an earthquake or disruptions of world oil supplies are more likely to cause a national energy emergency, but that a terrorist incident would be more serious. Among the initiatives taken to improve coordination with private energy companies was a program of special security training for company officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, the report said. A key reason for the initiative, according to department officials and documents, is growing concern about `` techno-terrorism,'' the use of hard-to-detect plastic explosives, hand-held missiles, electronic surveillance gear or other sophisticated devices to carry out politically motivated acts of sabotage. The heightened alert also reflects a fear of retaliatory strikes by <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, countries accused by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of supporting terrorism, the sources said. American bombers attacked <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> in April 1986, and Iranian oil facilities in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> were hit by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in October 1987 and April 1988. Taking its cue from the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> last December imposed new measures to strengthen protection against possible terrorist attacks at the few facilities it oversees that handle weapon-grade nuclear materials. However, the measures were not applied to nuclear power plants, which also are under <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> jurisdiction. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report said the most vulnerable segment of the energy system is the electric power grid, which is stretched across long distances in many remote, unprotected areas. Repairing or replacing critical power plant components such as generating stations can take weeks or months, it said. Less vulnerable, but still a source of concern, are oil refineries and offshore production facilities, oil and natural gas pipelines and coal transport links. In 1987, an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> team acting as terrorists staged a moch attack that `` knocked out'' power substations, an emergency operations center and valves of the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says it is tightening security for the oil stored against an embargo. The report noted that serious power disruptions have been carried out by terrorist organizations in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` In the past, these attacks generally were poorly designed and executed, but recent attacks by the same organizations have shown a higher level of technology and better planning,'' the report said. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Badolato </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary for energy emergencies, told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year that the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> began passing on intelligence agency `` threat advisories'' in 1987 to key industry trade organizations. He gave no details, however. <PERSON> Badolato </PERSON> declined to be interviewed on the subject. He is scheduled to testify about the program Wednesday before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The internal <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> document said the threat advisories are transmitted to organizations such as the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reliability </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The groups then pass on the warning to their members, the report said. A source said the advisories are issued during a heightened state of international alert, such as the July 1988 downing of a civilian Iranian airliner by the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorzelnik </PERSON>, director of communication at the electric council, confirmed that his organization was working with the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to assess security but would provide no details. `` It feels as if anything that is said about it ... may give them -LRB- terrorists -RRB- some hints or bring others out of the woodwork,'' <PERSON> Gorzelnik </PERSON> said. Officials said some industry executives have raised concern about possible antitrust and conflict-of-interest problems in cooperating directly with the government. `` As far as the oil industry is concerned there are some major concerns about antitrust,'' said <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kupperman </PERSON>, a leading private authority on energy-related terrorism, said a successful terrorist attack on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities is `` immensely feasible,'' but that industry executives are balking at the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> program because they `` do n't want to admit their vulnerabilities.'' `` They're being dragged into it by the scruffs of their necks,'' he said.

 One normally docile elephant took three people on a wild ride through a zoo and then plunged into a lake with them, and a second elsehwhere in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> killed a trainer it liked and then walked calmly away. Trainers did not know what spooked either animal. A 4-ton, 15-year-old female elephant used for paid rides at the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fair </LOCATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Myers </ORGANIZATION> broke loose from a petting zoo, tore through a crowded midway and plunged into a lake while carrying three terrified riders, one of them 4 years old. `` We were afraid he was going to kill us _ stomp on us,'' said <PERSON> Consolacion </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> of <PERSON> Alva </PERSON>, who was aboard the elephant with her young godson and his 18-year-old aunt. At least eight people were sent to local hospitals Saturday with minor back injuries and grease burns from fryers in toppled concession stands. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Frisco </PERSON>, an elephant caretaker, managed to grab a chest strap and slow the elephant until she stepped on a water tube. Water shot up, spooking the elephant again. She crashed into another stand before <LOCATION> Frisco </LOCATION> was able to stop the animal and guide her back to the corral. `` She had to be hit with a pellet gun or something.

At <LOCATION> Busch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, trainer <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> was returning a 17-year-old, 3-ton male elephant to its barn Sunday when he was knocked down and the animal used its head to crush him, said Sgt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Preston </PERSON>. `` Either he fell over the threshold of the barn door or the elephant pushed him. We'll never know,'' said <PERSON> Busch </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON>. The elephant then pulled up its head and walked back into the yard, she said. `` The elephant was tame, but not trained to do tricks,'' <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> said. `` The elephant knew him, and the elephant liked him.'' The elephant has been at <LOCATION> Busch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION> for about four months. It is one of two males among the 22 Asian elephants at the park, <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, 33, a 12-year park veteran, died at <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> of multiple injuries, a hospital spokesman said. The accident, which occurred out of public view, was the first fatality caused by an animal at the 30-year-old African theme park, said <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON>. In November, a 400-pound <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> tiger seriously mauled a caretaker.

<HEAD>High Court Reprimands Wheel For Misconduct</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former judge convicted last year of perjury as part of a scandal involving three state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices was reprimanded publicly by the court after finding her also guilty of judicial misconduct. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Friday accepted a recommendation by the <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> that former <LOCATION> Chittenden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Assistant Judge <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheel </PERSON> be found guilty of failing to conduct herself in a manner befitting a judge. The public reprimand is the harshest punishment possible because she is no longer a judge. Wheel and former justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> were charged in January 1987 with 25 counts of misconduct. The case has caused a major backlog in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> as the justices disqualified themselves from hundreds of cases in order to avoid potential conflicts of interest. The charges included allegations that Wheel and <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> had their arms around each other in an inappropriate display of affection in the courthouse, and that the justices tried to block an attorney general's investigation of allegations that Wheel falsified pay vouchers and used county funds to throw a party for <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>. Wheel and the three justices denied any wrongdoing. The case against <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> was dropped when he died; the one against <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> was dropped when he conceded some of his actions could have been construed as inappropriate. The conduct board in March found <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> guilty of five counts of misconduct and dismissed six others; the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has not acted on his case. Wheel was convicted last year of three counts of perjury brought because of the probe into the pay vouchers. She was sentenced in June to 45 days in jail and 1,500 hours' community service. The sentence is delayed pending appeal. In the misconduct case, conduct board prosecutors and Wheel agreed in November that she would not contest the single discourteous behavior charge and the prosecutors would drop all others. The board said it would accept the plea agreement because the judiciary had endured enough scandal. Wheel, who was voted out of office in 1986, maintains her innocence and stipulated only that others might have construed her actions as inappropriate, according to her attorney, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wing </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 An Israeli teen-ager avoided airport security booths at Ben-Gurion International Airport and boarded a jet bound for <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> before being caught without a ticket, an airport spokesman said today. The security breach occurred Sunday morning as former intelligence agents and airline officials from around the world gathered outside <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> for an Israeli-sponsored conference on aviation security. <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Eyal </PERSON> said the 16-uear-old boy who walked into the airport and onto the plane did not carry a weapon and apparently meant no harm but was `` apparently deranged.'' <PERSON> Eyal </PERSON> said the youth was caught by stewards when he failed to produce a ticket or boarding pass after boarding the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707. <PERSON> Eyal </PERSON> said the aircraft belonged to the Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Arkia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>. The boy was turned over to police, <PERSON> Eyal </PERSON> added. `` We are still investigating what happened. It is clear that something very wrong happened, an apparent security breach. We will take the necessary steps against whomever is found guilty,'' <PERSON> Eyal </PERSON> said. It was the second such incident at an Israeli airport in two months. In December, a 3-year-old girl wandered onto a civilian plane at an air force base in southern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that is also used for charter flights. She was caught moments before the plane took off for <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION>. At the conference near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, titled the `` <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION>,'' leading anti-terrorist experts and police from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are expected to deliberate methods to improve protection from hijackings and bombings. The issue of airport security has been particularly sensitive since the Dec. 21 bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. All 259 people on the jet and 11 people on the ground died.

<HEAD>Productivity Unchanged In Fourth Quarter; Up 1.4 Percent For 1988</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The productivity of American workers increased 1.4 percent last year, the government said today, matching the average gains of the six previous years but falling short of the growth needed to meet the forecast on which President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is basing his budget. Increased productivity _ getting each worker to produce more each hour he or she is on the job _ is vital to economic growth without inflation, particularly given the current squeeze in the labor market. But the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported non-farm productivity was unchanged in the fourth quarter of 1988 and was up 1.4 percent for the year. That marked an improvement over 1987 but was exactly in line with the 1.4 percent annual average in productivity gains since the end of the 1981-82 recession. Output in the non-farm sector was up 5.1 percent for the year, but average hours worked climbed 3.6 percent, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> reported Manufacturers reported a 3.2 percent productivity gain for 1988, down from 3.4 percent in 1987. Productivity in the business sector dropped 2.0 percent in the final quarter of 1988 and ended the year up 1.0 percent. The productivity report came as the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> prepared to set monetary goals for 1989 and as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> readied his budget proposals for delivery to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> later this week. <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> is expected to seek to tighten the central bank's reins on credit to ease inflation. That would run counter to the economic forecast of nearly 3 percent annual growth that former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> included in his final budget and that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has adopted for his amended spending plan. One possible way for the economy to grow at 3 percent a year or more without an inflationary surge in wages would be through significant productivity gains, something on which the Reagan-Bush economic forecast relies. The forecast assumes productivity gains averaging 1.9 percent a year, which along with the projected growth of the labor force would allow for potential economic growth of 3.2 percent a year. Some economists have attacked the rosy projections of the budget's economic forecast. They say productivity gains, which averaged just 0.6 percent a year between 1973 and 1981 and 1.4 percent since then, are too difficult to predict.

<TEXT>
 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> today accused the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> of breaking its promise to refrain from terror and indicated <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will ask the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to end its dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, police fired tear gas and rubber bullets on the main shopping street of the city's Arab sector to disperse several dozen <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> stone-throwers who smashed cars and shop windows. A teen-ager was reported injured. `` Two days ago, we had an example of a terrorist act by a branch of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said in a speech to the New York-based Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. He cited a clash Saturday in which Israeli troops killed five Palestinian fighters on the northern border of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-proclaimed security zone in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> The radical <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> factions of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> and the Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> said their guerrillas were on a mission to attack Israeli positions. <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said the action `` clearly and unequivocally violated'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions for opening talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> after a 13-year boycott. `` I presume that in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, they also noticed what happened. But, to the extent that somebody there may not have noticed, we will draw his attention to it,'' <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> added on <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, after the speech. A Foreign Ministry official later said, `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is calling on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to reconsider the dialogue considering that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, the <PERSON> Habash </PERSON> faction, took responsibility for the attempt to penetrate <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials shocked <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> by opening talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in December after <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> renounced terrorism and said he accepted <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> argues the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has not changed its objective of destroying the Jewish state. Israeli officials note <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> faction has refrained from attacks but express doubt that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> can control other, more militant <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> factions. <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>, head of the Jewish conference of presidents, said he, too, would pressure the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to end contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm not sure the administration is prepared to cut off the dialogue yet,'' <PERSON> Reich </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>. `` But we're going to press them on these issues and remind them that ... these terrorist acts are continuing.'' In a speech Sunday, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would never allow a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state to exist and branded <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> people `` brutal, wild, alien invaders in the land of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' In the occupied territories, meanwhile, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops today shot a 15-year-old Palestinian girl in the thigh, Arab hospital officials said. <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> residents were on strike for a second day to protest the deaths Saturday of two <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> youths shot in clashes with troops. Merchants shuttered their shops and students went home. The army said it was checking the report about the girl's injury. Since the December 1987 start of the uprising, 373 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have been killed.

<TEXT>
 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said today <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will continue to export its Islamic revolution, but not by force, and that better relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are possible only if <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> changes its hostile stance. `` We have a concept and we are going to continue the policy to export the revolution,'' <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> told a news conference. `` But this does n't mean we're going to export the revolution with a gun.'' He also said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> will resume direct peace talks to end their eight-year war `` soon,'' but that there would be no progress unless <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> troops were withdrawn from Iranian territory. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has been restoring relations with Western countries and its Arab neighbors as part of a policy aimed at ending a decade of self-imposed isolation. But the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> hierarchy is deeply divided over the issue of restoring links with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, severed in 1979. `` Except for the Palestine-occupying regime and the racist South African regime, and precluding American sabotage, we desire good relations with other countries of the world,'' <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said. Speaking in the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s ornate audience hall in front of a life-sized portrait of Iranian spiritual leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said the export of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s revolution would be `` cultural.'' `` As you do in Western countries, you're trying to make other people in the world to be Western-oriented,'' he said. `` We're going to do the same on the basis of our Islamic beliefs and concepts.'' The news conference was attended by scores of foreign correspondents in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to cover celebrations marking the 10th anniversary of the revolution. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s so-called pragmatists, led by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, have made it clear that with the Aug. 20 cease-fire in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has backed off the militant export of its fundamentalist revolution. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said the peace talks were deadlocked and `` will be useless'' unless <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> withdraws its troops from Iranian territory. `` If <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> adopts a stubborn attitude and refuses to retreat, the talks will get nowhere,'' he said. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> gave no date for resuming direct talks with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which broke off in November over the issue of troop withdrawals. However, he and <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> are due in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> this week for talks with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. The Iranians have charged that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> still holds about 390 square miles of their territory. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has refused to withdraw until it gets a guarantee of freedom of navigation in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and until the <LOCATION> Shatt-al-Arab </LOCATION> waterway, its main passage to the gulf, is cleared of sunken ships and other war debris.

<HEAD>Proposal Would Deny Parole To Illiterate Inmates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 State officials are studying a proposal to deny parole to illiterate inmates in an effort to motivate them to learn to read, Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> says. `` I believe we have got to overcome the problem of illiteracy,'' <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> published today. `` We've got people in prison we need to rehabilitate, and one of the tools for rehabilitation is learning to read. `` I'm trying to think of ways we can motivate or discipline people into using that time to acquire the skill of reading.'' If <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> can not constitutionally require literacy as a condition for release, <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said, he hopes to develop other incentives. Of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s 6,000 prison inmates, 55 percent do not have a high school degree or its equivalent. More than 27 percent read below a seventh-grade level, according to a survey of 2,938 inmates conducted a year ago. Experts believe many ex-convicts wind up back behind bars because they do n't have the skills to get and keep a good job. One proposal would require that illiterate inmates successfully complete literacy classes before they are allowed to take higher-paying prison jobs, said <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Abeyta </PERSON> of the corrections department. At the present, prisoners enrolled in academic programs earn just 56 cents a day while those with jobs earn 80 cents a day or more. Under a pilot program established by the legislature in 1988, 100 inmates at <ORGANIZATION> Buena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facility </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facility </ORGANIZATION> earn an extra four days a month off their sentences for participating in literacy programs `` People are staying in the programs longer than they were before without any incentives,'' <PERSON> Abeyta </PERSON> said. `` Money and reduction in time are the two big issues in prison.''

 The last <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> convoys abandoned their garrisons and headed north for home today, Soviet officials said, bringing to an end a nine-year mission that cost more than 13,000 Soviet lives. Hundreds of Soviet troops guarded the airport of the war-weary Afghan capital as military transports ferried in loads of grain and other supplies to help ease food shortages caused by guerrilla blockades. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda reported `` the last Soviet soldier left <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'' on Sunday. But Soviet officials in the city said about 1,000 troops would remain at the airport until the end of the week. In neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> met with Pakistani officials but said today the talks failed to find a way to peacefully end the Afghan war. He said the Soviets will continue to support <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Marxist government but would not send troops back into the country. Under a U.N.-brokered accord, all Soviets forces are to be out by Feb. 15. Soviet diplomats said <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops in the western city of <LOCATION> Shindand </LOCATION> left their garrison, the remaining Soviet military complex in the country. The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the soldiers headed over the weekend toward <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION> to meet a convoy there and were expected to reach the Soviet border Wednesday or Thursday. Pravda said Soviet troops had by Sunday removed defensive checkpoints on the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> to about 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> at the end of a tunnel that cuts through some of the roughest terrain on the withdrawal route. Pravda said insurgents did not fire on Soviet convoys on the highway, the only land route to the Soviet border from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. But four avalanches crashed down on retreating columns Sunday, killing three Soviet soldiers and injuring a fourth, the paper said. Three officers were also injured by `` terrorist grenades'' in a <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> suburb Sunday as the Soviets handed over motor vehicles to the Afghans, the newspaper said. In the Soviet border city of <LOCATION> Termez </LOCATION>, where a Soviet airborne regiment arrived from <LOCATION> Afganistan </LOCATION> today, military spokesman Lt. Col. <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Korolev </PERSON> said the last remaining <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers were on the move toward the border. He said Soviet soldiers were moving out of <LOCATION> Balkh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Samangan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baglan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Parvan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION> provinces. The troops of the 350th Parachute Regiment were greeted by thousands of residents, servicemen and relatives as they roared across the Friendship Bridge over the <LOCATION> Amu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Termez </LOCATION>. The unit had been stationed in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> since 1984. Along the road behind the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> airport, meanwhile, several Soviet soldiers manned bunker checkpoints, nervously clutching rifles. <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON>, a 20-year-old soldier from <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION>, said the troops would be flown home sometime before Feb. 15. He said they had not been told exactly when. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> today reported that heavy shelling by guerrillas in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> province killed eight people. It said one person was killed and two wounded in shelling in the cities of <LOCATION> Gardiz </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paktia </LOCATION> province. Rockets and rocket-propelled grenades also hit residential areas in the city of <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION> and the airport in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. With the Soviet pullout, those cities are held by the conscript army of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, a force guerrilla commanders say is demoralized and crippled by desertion. The highest-ranking <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> diplomat in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, Charge d'Affaires <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Petit </PERSON>, his wife and three Austrian diplomats left the capital today for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. Also on the flight were relatives of Yugoslav, East German and Vietnamese diplomats. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said his talks in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> failed because insurgents refuse to share power with <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. He told a news conference that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> would continue to support the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government. `` If new complications happen, if there is continued fighting, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has obligations to that country,'' he said. However, the Soviet envoy added, `` We are not thinking of any Soviet re-entry into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> sent troops into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to replace one Marxist regime with another and stayed to help fight the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> - and Pakistani-backed insurgents The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> says more than 13,000 Soviet troops were killed and 35,000 wounded in the conflict.

 Fifteen Armenians with crushed limbs, skulls and bones are in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> today for treatment of their injuries suffered in December's devastating earthquake.

 The judge at <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial scheduled a closed-door hearing today reportedly to hear concerns of the intelligence community about classified information in the Iran-Contra case. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> scheduled the hearing as the jury selection process resumed and the judge added two people to the pool of prospective jurors, bringing the total to 34. He rejected three others, including a woman who knew someone who was on a grand jury that has investigated the Iran-Contra affair. Another woman rejected for the pool said she `` heard it in passing. It was all over the news.'' One woman sent into the jury pool is an office clerk who said she recalled seeking a July 1987 magazine with <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s picture on the cover, but did n't recognize <PERSON> North </PERSON> in the courtroom and when asked whether she had heard of him said, `` No, I never have.'' Another woman approved for the jury pool said she had seen <PERSON> North </PERSON> on television in his Marine uniform. That drew objections from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who suggested she had been exposed to the fired <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide's immunized congressional testimony in 1987. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, however, said that `` while she saw, she did not listen'' to what was being said. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> scheduled the closed-door hearing at the request of the head of the prosecution team, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>, who apparently was acting on behalf of the intelligence community in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said only that the hearing would deal with objections by the office of independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> `` to one of my earlier orders.'' It was understood that the matter pertained to classified information. <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> and a representative of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> wanted to be at the hearing, to which <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> readily agreed, responding: `` I have been trying to get the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> here without too much success.'' Last Thursday, <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> asked on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and intelligence agencies that they be provided with four seats in the courtroom during the trial. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> agreed, but said he was concerned that `` security gurus'' would try to run the case. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> made strong objections late last month to Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> over classified information that would be presented in the case and said it warranted blocking the trial. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> rejected the <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION>'s suggestion <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s remarks today came as 39 additional prospective jurors were sworn in, some of whom will undergo questioning on how much they know about <PERSON> North </PERSON> and the Iran-Contra affair. If they were not exposed to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s immunized congressional testimony in 1987, they likely will be placed in a pool from which a jury is to be chosen later this week. Thirty-four people have been approved for the jury pool since the trial began last Tuesday and <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> wants to have a group of 45 from which to choose 12 jurors and six alternates. The jury pool's lack of knowledge, and interest, in the Iran-Contra affair marks them as unusual. Out of the first 104 jurors who came into the courtroom, just 31 said they had n't watched, listened or read about <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s 1987 testimony to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in which he detailed many of the activities for which he is now accused of crimes A number of the prospective jurors who were approved for the jury pool by <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> have said they recall hearing somewhere about shredding of documents in connection with the Iran-Contra affair or North, but recall nothing more than that. Three counts of the 12 criminal charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON> allege that he destroyed documents to conceal aid to the Contras and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's sale of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Most of the prospective jurors said they simply glance at front-page newspaper headlines and switch channels or do n't pay attention when the news comes on. They said they are too busy with jobs or occupied with other interests to have paid much attention to the biggest foreign policy debacle of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Most are blue - or pink-collar workers, several with the government, while several others are unemployed or retired One woman is holding down two jobs. Of the first 25 prospective jurors, a dozen finished the 12th grade, one has a master's degree, two others finished college and another has some college education. Their occupations range from cement finisher to mental health administrator. North is accused of allegedly concealing from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 and 1986 his efforts on behalf of the Nicaraguan Contras and of covering up from the attorney general the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s role in diverting money from the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sales to the Contras. North also is accused of illegally accepting a $ 13,800 security system at his home from co-defendant <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, converting to his own use at least $ 4,300 in traveler's checks from <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> and conspiring to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> of tax revenue in connection with contributions to the Contras.

 Civil rights leader <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said today his <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> has signed an agreement with Soviet officials to have an international telethon to raise resources for earthquake-devastated <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who returned recently from a six-day visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' that he found conditions in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> in the wake of the Dec. 7 quake `` really incomprehensible.'' `` We've signed an agreement between the <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, the minister of culture, the minister of radio and television to have an international telethon on June 10,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The program would link <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and `` perhaps <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to raise resources to build churches, houses, hospitals and schools.'' The Rainbow Coalition is <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s national political group, so-called because its aim is to encompass people of every race. What is needed right now, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` is prefabricated housing. And just as many people have sent trees to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as a concrete way of making a statement, people or groups may want to send prefabricated housing to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Or they may want to send direct contributions to the church.'' The aftermath of the earthquake, he said, is `` an excellent opportunity for us as a nation to penetrate and to build good will within the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and between our two countries.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said that during his visit, `` I made an appeal on the basis of human rights to release some Soviet Jews, and they released four while we were there.'' He did not elaborate. Last Thursday he said in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that he did not know the names of four Jewish refuseniks granted permission to leave the country. However, his spokesman, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, said today in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> that the four are <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Vladimirovich </PERSON> <PERSON> Kagan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Veniaminovich </PERSON> <PERSON> Mestechkin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Evgenia </PERSON> <PERSON> Abramovna </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldshtein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mihailovich </PERSON> <PERSON> Civkin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said the four have been given permission to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Easter </PERSON>, a press aide who accompanied <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, said Soviet officials did not say when the four would be allowed to leave the country, but they would be given freedom of movement immediately. The former Democratic presidential candidate said the earthquake presents `` a challenge to glasnost or openness in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, to their restructuring of their priorities.'' `` I think we must monitor their words, we must verify their commitments, we must also match their deeds as they move toward disarmament and move toward Third World development and ending Third World conflicts,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` I think it's a tremendous opportunity and we ought to match it and seize it.''

 In most Cajun towns, masked horsemen celebrate <PERSON> Mardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gras </PERSON> as they have for hundreds of years, with a riotous ride from farm to farm to scare up some chickens and other ingredients for a huge pot of gumbo. But in <LOCATION> Tee-Mamou </LOCATION>, a town of about 400 people deep in <LOCATION> Cajun </LOCATION> country, the `` courir du Mardi Gras'' has used trucks since 1919 _ the year the horses died. `` They were running pretty hard, it was rek,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Tee-Mamou-Iota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mardis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gras </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Folklife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s folklikind of a long tfe director. `` They ended up running across a blue norther that was blowing in right at the end of their run. `` They got to the farmhouse to do their gumbo, and tied the horses up.'' When they went out later, about two-thirds of the 28 horses had died from pneumonia brought on by the sudden chill after a long, hot run. `` It sobered up a lot of mardi gras early and it busted up the dance,'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, using `` mardi gras'' as folks do in these parts, to mean those who participate in the drunken ride. Since that night in <LOCATION> Tee-Mamou </LOCATION>, a town so small it seldom shows up on maps of <LOCATION> Acadia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION>, the courir has been made by truck _ a flatbed at first, and now on a specially made wagon drawn by a pickup. My <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said, `` The only words that are both in their song and our song is ` We come from <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>.' That's kind of curious.'' That reference in French-speaking southern <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> may be to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s tradition of costumed peasants begging in hard times or to the Acadians' flight from <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION> after it became English territory, he said. After the chant and some dancing, things get really wild. `` They break out and run all over the place, chasing chickens and getting whatever charity they can get out of the farmhouse,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. `` They'll frequently go in to scare the womenfolks or children. It's kind of customary for the women and teen-age girls to be deathly afraid of the mardi gras. And little boys as well,'' he said. `` It's kind of an ongoing thing from generation to generation. You grow up scared of the mardi gras. `` Later on you become one of them.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s point man for ethics policy, <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, is resigning as chairman of a multimillion-dollar communications company to avoid any appearance of conflict of interest, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said today. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s official legal counsel since 1981, previously had said he would remain as chairman of the family-owned <ORGANIZATION> Summit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> but would refuse a salary. He resigned, effective today, after consulting with the heads of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s new ethics commission, said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the action was prompted in part by news accounts over the weekend in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that pointed out that the <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had a policy that forbade employees from serving in such chairmanships or earnign outside income. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said there would have been `` nothing inappropriate'' about <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> keeping the post in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. But he said <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> was advised to resign by former Attorney General <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> and federal appeals Judge <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkie </PERSON>, chairman and vice chairman, respectively, of the newly created President's Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform. `` The duties of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel are sufficiently broad that it would be constructive to resign such a directorship to avoid any possibility of even the appearance of conflict,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters. He said <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> also would be putting his personal assets into a blind trust. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> estimated <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s investments at $ 10 million. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has made a major point in his presidency of stressing high ethical standards for government employees, and said he wants tougher ethical rules than those he inherited from his predecessor, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> has the president's highest trust and confidence and he will remain the primary adviser to the presidnet on ethical matters,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was aware that every year for the past eight years when <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> worked for him as vice president the Office of Government Ethics reviewed and approved <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s financial disclosure forms, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had a policy that no White House officials should accept outside earned income or serve on the boards of outside corporations, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Q. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nebeker </PERSON>, director of the Office of Government Ethics, said Sunday. This policy was mentioned in a 1983 written advisory opinion by the ethics office that was distributed to all government ethics officials, including <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, the Times said. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> was not bound by those rules when he worked for the vice president, whose policy was more lenient, and he was paid several hundred thousand dollars over the eight years for serving as chairman of the company that owns at least a dozen radio stations and has about 130,000 cable subscribers in the South. He reported the income on his financial disclosure forms. More recent forms have also disclosed payments for his work as co-executor of the estate of his father, who died in 1982. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> told the newspapers that he stopped accepting payment from Summit for his work at the beginning of the year. `` Due to my promotion and due to the policies enunciated by -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- during the presidential campaign, I can not and I will not take outside income and so have instructed the family company,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made a campaign pledge in July that his appointees would not accept any outside income, but he did not address the problem of serving on outside corporations' boards. Last week, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appointed an eight-member commission to review government ethical standards, including conflict-of-interest law. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not yet named a White House ethics officer, but <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> has been serving informally in that role since before the inauguration. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, who has an unpublished telephone number, could not be reached for comment Sunday, according to the White House. His deputy, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmitz </PERSON>, as suffering from back problems and was unavailable, said <PERSON> Schmitz </PERSON>' mother. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that he has avoided conflict-of-interest problems by recusing himself since 1981 from any matters concerning communications. He also said he had no conflict because he was not Summit's chief executive or operating officer. He said he devoted four to six days a year to overseeing the company. Ninty-three percent of the company's stock is owned by a trust administered by <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> and his brothers, the Times reported. <PERSON> Nebeker </PERSON> declined to say what <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> should do about his chairmanship of Summit to meet White House ethics standards, saying: `` I'm not prepared to make any suggestions to him at all.'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, who worked with <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> on presidential transition matters, defended <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> on Sunday. `` All I can say is, during the several meetings I participated in with him and his staff dealing with ethics issues, I have never seen anybody more concerned not only with strict compliance with ethics issues but indeed, nobody was more sensitive as to the appearance issues as well,'' <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said. `` Specific communications issues did come up during transition and he immediately advised everyone in the room that he was not to be involved in those issues,'' said <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, an attorney who now works for the <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` I personally witnessed him removing himself from any deliberations for appointments on the FCC.'' <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Muris </PERSON>, who worked on the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> transition, also attested Sunday to <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s recusal from communications matters. `` <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> never had any conversations with me about the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Nebeker </PERSON> said he met with <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> on numerous occasions after the November election and before the inauguration to discuss matters concerning ethics and <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s financial disclosure. `` I apprised him of the existence of the 15 percent rule,'' a law under which officials above a certain salary are prohibited from earning an amount equal to more than 15 percent of their government salary in outside earned income such as wages or other compensation, <PERSON> Nebeker </PERSON> said. Interest and dividends are not included. <PERSON> Nebeker </PERSON> said that while <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> had not been at that level before, `` he's at it now'' because his salary has increased.

 The public outcry over the proposed 51 percent pay increase for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should hardly be surprising. Americans have been objecting to congressional pay raises for nearly all of the 200-year history of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Alexis </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Tocqueville </PERSON>, a close observer of American life, offered an explanation in his 1835 study, `` Democracy in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' His conclusion: Democracies are far more stingy than other forms of government when it comes to paying high-ranking officials. Part of the reason, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Tocqueville </PERSON> wrote, is that a salary level which seems inadequate to the official receiving it `` appears enormous to him whose wants do not extend beyond the necessities of life.'' `` When he reflects on own humble dwelling and the small earnings of his hard toil, he remembers all he could do with a salary which you judge insufficient, and he is startled and almost frightened at the view of so much wealth,'' he said. More than 150 years later, little has changed. `` We have never had a satisfactory method for setting compensation for high government officials,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>. `` We still do not. `` If contemporary public opinion were the sole determinant, the pay of members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today would be the same as it was in 1789.'' The root of the problem is in the Constitution. Article I, Section 6 provides: `` Senators and Representatives shall receive a compensation for their services, to be ascertained by law, and paid out of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' That sounds well enough in theory. But in practice it leaves the question of congressional pay levels up to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> itself, posing an always sensitive, uncomfortabe and sometimes politically explosive problem. Some of the framers of the Constitution thought it would give members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a license to steal. Others argued that pressure from incensed constituents would rein in greedy impulses. The issue has always been approached gingerly at best. `` Bringing up the pay raise issue is about as welcome in a legislative body as a skunk is at a Sunday school picnic,'' says Sen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>. The first major <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> squabble over a proposal to raise the pay of members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> arose in 1816 and it set back the early political career of <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, who later was to become a famous orator, senator, and secretary of state. From the convening of the 1st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1789 until 1816, a 27-year span, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> were paid at the rate of $ 6 a day _ with attempts made from time to time to dock the pay of absentees. In 1816 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ended the day-by-day payments and adopted an annual salary of $ 1,500 a year. The result: public outrage. Nine members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> resigned and several were defeated in the 1816 elections. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> was one of those ousted in the pay-raise revolt. It took him until 1822 to persuade the voters to send him back to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. The $ 1,500 annual salary also was a casualty; It was repealed in 1817 and the next year congressional pay was set at $ 8 a day. Eight dollars a day remained congressional pay for the next 38 years. The idea of an annual salary finally prevailed in 1854 when the compensation for members was set at $ 3,000 a year. Congressional pay rose to $ 5,000 a year in 1865. But when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> acted in 1871 to boost the total to $ 7,500 annually, the voters rebelled again. The higher salary had been made retroactive to the beginning of the 42nd Congress two years earlier, in effect giving members a lump sum windfall of $ 5,000. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> already was besieged by accusations of corruption. The new pay increase brought cries of `` salary grab'' and `` back-pay steal.'' Members could not take the heat and when the 43rd <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> convened dozens of bills were introduced to repeal the increase. Congressional salaries soon were rolled back to the $ 5,000 level where they remained until 1907, a period of 33 years. Congressional pay was cut twice during the Depression of the 1930s. Salaries, which had reached $ 10,000 by 1925, were reduced to $ 9,000 in 1932 and to $ 8,500 the next year. But they have been growing slowly ever since. The present congressional salary: $ 89,500. The proposal by an independent commission: Increase it to $ 135,000 to more nearly approach the compensation offered in the private sector to lawyers, corporate executives and others with similar responsibilities. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has already rejected the raise, 95-0. The House may or may not act. The prospects _ as usual _ are highly uncertain.

<HEAD>Michigan Governor To Outline Plan To Aid First-Time Home-Buyers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new program to help first-time <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> home-buyers meet their down payments will be formally proposed this week, Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said today. In his State of the State speech Tuesday, <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said, he will propose the Home Ownership Savings Trust program, similar to the state's program to help parents save for their children's college costs. `` I think this program will not only work, but sweep the country,'' <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said. The program will let would-be first-time buyers of homes invest small sums each month in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> revenue bonds for three to 10 years. They would earn tax-free interest on their savings. When enrolling in the program, they would declare what price range house they were seeking and would save toward a down payment for a house in that range. The state would guarantee them enough money for a down payment on a house in the declared price range, no matter how much housing prices might increase during the time the would-be buyers are saving, the governor said. The plan is modeled after the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Education Trust, in which parents invest with the state for their offsprings' college educations. The state then covers costs at state universities, regardless of how much tuition may increase by the time the children are old enough for college. In his address Tuesday, <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> will also outline a `` workfare'' program aimed at getting able-bodied persons age 18 to 25 off the dole. `` This is not a budget-cutting measure. It's a long-term investment,'' <PERSON> Babcock </PERSON> said. `` If we do n't do something to have these people enter the labor market, they have a greater chance of long-term dependency.''

<HEAD>Aircraft Broker Tells Senate Panel of Kickback Demand From Navajo</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> aircraft broker told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> investigative panel today that Navajo officials sought a $ 45,000 kickback from him in 1987 when he tried to sell them two planes. <PERSON> Drex </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said he was n't told who would get the alleged kickback, but believed <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> would eventually receive at least some of the money. `` I do n't believe it would have gone directly to him,'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. `` I do believe he would have benefited by it.'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> told members of the investigative panel of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Indian Affairs that the deal, to sell two King Air twin-engine turboprop passenger planes, was never made. The committee has been holding hearings since last week on accusations of corruption in federal Indian programs and on reservations. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> also said the Navajo would not pay him $ 89,269 they owed him for several charter flights his company provided for <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> and his family until he threatened to tell the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> about the alleged kickback request. He said after making the threat, he worked out an arrangement with <LOCATION> Navajo </LOCATION> officials under which they paid him $ 64,269 for the flights. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said his company arranged seven or eight charter flights for <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> and his family, who live on the <LOCATION> Navajo </LOCATION> reservation in northeastern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, including trips to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to attend a daughter's graduation from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> has consistently denied allegations of impropriety raised at the hearings.

 A twisted old oak tree dripping with moss and overlooking a pasture south of this small rural farming community has become something of a landmark. There's no marker or sign to `` The Shoe Tree,'' but you ca n't miss it Nailed to the thick trunk is a wide assortment of footgear, all in pairs. The collection stretches from near the ground to high above the reach of a normal person. Work boots. Cowboy boots. Women's spike heels. Even a pair of baby running shoes. Most of them obviously have been well used. Residents say they started showing up about two years ago and now there are about 20 pairs. One resident, <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>, said the first shoes were placed by the tree as a joke between a young man and a girl he was courting. They eventually married and moved away, but <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> says they still come back to keep the shoe tree well-stocked. `` You never know what people are going to do around here,'' <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> said.

 Imagine a combination of `` Pee Wee's Playhouse'' on wheels and <LOCATION> Chevy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION> stepping out to peddle copies of his latest movie. That's something like the `` U.S.A. Rest Stop Movie Tour.'' Creators of the feature-length video `` Only A Buck'' left their home base in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, in early November to hawk their movie from the Brickmobile _ a brick-sided motor home. They set up shop at rest stops, traffic jams, street corners and gas stations _ anywhere that they're allowed to stop for more than five minutes. `` The point all along has been to make a name, maybe find a distributor or get this elevated to the status of cult film,'' explained writer-producer-director <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>. `` Only A Buck,'' about a TV news cameraman who sets out to make his own movie, was a surprise hit at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Independent Feature Project and was one of only two films from the project accepted into <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>'s prestigious <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Film Festival last year. A videotape of `` Only A Buck'' goes for $ 19.95. Shunning the traditional movie-distribution route has produced more than its share of odd moments. `` The day we left, we were all of a half-hour out of <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> and we come onto a wreck ... trucks jack-knifed all over the place,''' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> recalled during a recent three-week stopover in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area. Then `` all of a sudden <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Hunrichs </PERSON>, actor-composer -RRB- jumps out of the back of the truck wearing a helmet with a flashing light on top, and yelling, ` Blue-light special!' like they do at K mart. `` Well, none of these truckers were in what you'd call in a good mood. But looking on the bright side, I recall he did find one buyer.''

<HEAD>Pentagon Says Illicit Drug Use in the Armed Forces Declines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The illicit use of drugs in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> armed forces has declined even more than had been indicated last summer by preliminary results of a worldwide survey, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. Use of marijuana declined from 6.5 percent in 1985 to 2.9 percent last year, while use of other illicit drugs dropped from 5.8 percent in 1985 to 3.1 percent in 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. The overall figure for the use of any drug dropped from 9 percent in 1985 to 4.8 percent in 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. Cigarette smoking and heavy alcohol use also declined, and the survey `` found that almost 80 percent of military personnel took some action within the past year to improve their nutrition,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> added. Last July, based on some preliminary results from the same survey, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> projected 1988's overall illegal drug use rate at 5.5 percent. The additional drop to a rate of 4.8 percent is based on final tabulations of statistics from military outposts around the world, the Pentagon said. The 1988 survey is the fourth conducted since 1980, when the Pentagon began attacking a drug problem within the ranks that had become almost out of control. In 1980, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> discovered more than a quarter of its military personnel _ 27.6 percent _ admitted using drugs illegally. The Pentagon responded with a variety of tougher disciplinary sanctions, including dismissal from the service, and launched a program that now subjects every man and woman in the military to random urine testing for drugs. The worldwide surveys are not part of the disciplinary program, however. They are conducted every three years in strict confidentiality to chart what, if any, progress is being made. As finally tabulated, the 1988 survey concluded that `` cigarette smoking and use of other tobacco products dropped significantly between 1980 and 1988.'' `` Cigarette use declined from 51 percent in 1980 to 40.9 percent in 1988. Heavy smoking, smoking one or more packs a day, declined from 34.2 percent in 1980 to 22.7 percent.'' On the use of alcohol, the level of heavy drinking _ defined as consumption of five or more drinks at least once a week _ also continued an eight-year decline. In 1980, the survey found 14.1 percent acknowledging heavy alcohol use. That figure is now down to 8.2 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. The 1988 survey, conducted for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Triangle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, involved the completion of lengthy questionnaries by 18,673 men and women in the service.

 President <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> today denied reports linking him to drug trafficking and said he will try to curtail cocaine shipments through his country. Also today, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>'s office announced that elections to choose a new president and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will be held May 1. The army general, who took power in a coup Friday, also said his overthrow of Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> was necessary for the sake of the country, but he said <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> might be allowed to return from exile in the future. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, who ruled for 34 years as president and commander-in-chief of the armed forces, left <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> on Sunday to the jeers of `` Dictator Get Out!'' He was in a remote farming town in central <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, and the Brazilian <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said today he would remain there indefinitely. `` I detest drugs,'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said. `` I swear as a Catholic and as a family man, I swear on my children, I have no connections with drugs,'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. At a news conference earlier at the National Palace, he said allegations he protects or sponsors drug shipments `` were spread by people trying to defame me.'' He said he would cooperate with foreign governments and agencies, including the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, to curtail the flow of illegal drugs through <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said he ousted <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> because the general `` was not producing good results for his party, which had trusted him.'' The remark was an apparent reference to jockeying for power and infighting between pro-Stroessner militants within the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and those who wanted to distance the group somewhat from the 76-year-old <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, 65, added, `` -LRB- He -RRB- was not a dictator. His situation is being studied by the court system. He could come back in two or three years. He has gone for a rest in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>.'' He dismissed reports from diplomatic sources and local media that casualties from fighting during the coup topped 300. `` Believe me, total casualties _ dead plus injured _ do not exceed 50,'' he said. The government has issued no official tally As soon as <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> was sworn in Friday, talk began about allegations he allowed drug traffickers to use <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> to move cocaine out of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Buenos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aires </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> commented in an editorial Saturday: `` There are reasons to link him -LRB- <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> -RRB- to the rampant corruption and even the drug trafficking under the <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> regime ... Yesterday's events -LRB- the coup -RRB- might not improve the system and could even make things worse if <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> becomes the <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> of the region.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military ruler, was indicated on drug trafficking charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year. He has denied the allegations. A high-ranking foreign diplomat acknowledged rumors that <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> allowed traffickers to use an airstrip he owns near the border with <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, but said: `` Absolutely no proof of that has ever been offered.'' <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Campinas </LOCATION>, 290 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>, then took a Brazilian air force plane to the rural town of <LOCATION> Itumbiara </LOCATION>, 800 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>, a Brazilian <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> communique said. The deposed dictator, accompanied by a son and daughter-in-law, three security guards, a Brazilian diplomat and 12 aides, was staying in a guest house owned by the government-run <ORGANIZATION> Furnas </ORGANIZATION> electric company, the communique said. Brazilian Ambassador <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Carbonar </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that his nation granted <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> asylum on humanitarian grounds. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> owns a beachfront mansion in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coastal resort of <LOCATION> Guaratuba </LOCATION>. The new government quickly promised democratic reforms, including allowing opposition parties to participate in elections. One opposition leader suggested that elections be delayed because his group and others needed time to organize to have any chance of defeating the entrenched <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has been in power since 1940. `` If Gen. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> is realistic, he should stay in power for a minimum of two years and make changes in the electoral law that will permit the organization of parties, and then call elections on the basis of equality,'' said <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rufinelli </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.

 Apparently, no one told the president's military police about his press conference So, it was a little surprising Monday when the raucous reporters who were invited into <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> Palace for the first news conference with a <LOCATION> Paraguayan </LOCATION> leader in anyone's memory ran headlong into the armed guards outside an ornate ballroom. Brandishing their Brazilian-made assault rifles, the guards in green uniforms, white helmets and ascots chased the correspondents away from the ballroom, the site of the news conference. Soon, however, the nervous aides to President <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who seized power in a military coup four days ago, cleared up the mixup with the guards. The reporters were led into the ballroom. There, amid colonial-style chandeliers, historic oil paintings and the oriental rugs was a table and a large, upholstered chair for the president from which to preside at the unprecedented news conference. Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, the dictator overthrown Friday by <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, never held an actual news conference in his nearly 35 years in power. He rarely would meet with small groups of journalists but old-time Paraguayans could not recall any former leader taking direct, uncensored questions from reporters. Perhaps that was why the Paraguayans seemed so unprepared. There was no microphone or public address system for the president, no place for tape recorders and no platform for TV cameras. The journalists furiously began stringing wires and cables, and they jostled for places around the table. Furniture was rearranged, and reporters who could n't get near the nment officials pleaded. `` Get away from the table! Leave the chairs along!'' But the reporters, who had gathered at the downtown palace at 6 a.m. and had waited hours for the news conference, jammed in closer. Authorities then announced <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> would meet with reporters in small groups downstairs in his office. That sent the pack _ swearing in several languages _ surging out of the ballroom and back toward the red-carpeted staircase. Once more, the MPs moved in. Finally, journalists in bunches of five to 10 got to meet <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>. Standing behind a mahogany desk, wearing a dark business suit and fiddling with gold-framed glasses, the 65-year-old general calmly answered touchy questions on drug trafficking, political persecution, car theft and harboring international criminals.

 <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s foreign minister obtained an assurance from officials in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> that some foreign hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> will soon be freed, the official <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported today. KUNA, quoting diplomats traveling with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON>, said `` he obtained a promise from responsible officials there -LRB- <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> -RRB- that a number of Western hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> will be released within a short period.''

But <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> also accused <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> of not keeping a promise to free <PERSON> Anis </PERSON> <PERSON> Naccache </PERSON>, the leader of a pro-Iranian hit squad jailed for attempting to assassinate a former Iranian prime minister. <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> after a two-day visit to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the first by a ranking French official since the 1979 Islamic revolution toppled the pro-Western monarchy.

 A man accused of slaying 14 family members before he went on a rampage in an <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> town and killed two other people went on trial today as jury selection got under way. <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, 48, already is on death row after his murder conviction in May for the Dec. 28, 1987, shooting of two people in <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION>, including a woman said to have refused his romantic advances. The new trial is for the shooting and strangulation deaths of <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Becky </PERSON>, 46; their seven children; two of the children's spouses; and four of <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' grandchildren, one of whom relatives say he fathered by one of his daughters. They were killed in the days before the shootings at <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION>. Officials had summoned 90 persons today as potential jurors. By noon, two had been chosen for the jury, a 22-year-old housewife and a 76-year-old retired civilian employee of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. One of the 90 did n't make it to court this morning, and three others were excused during preliminary questioning. Jury selection was continuing. The current trial was moved from <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Clarksville </LOCATION> because of pretrial publicity. Circuit Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> addressed that issue when he asked the potential jurors, `` Is there anybody who has not heard anything about this case?'' Nobody raised their hand. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> told them he realized that he `` can not make you just wipe things out of your mind and forget it,'' but that courtroom verdicts must be based upon a higher quality of evidence than what is reported in the media. Earlier today, the defense made an unsuccessful motion to let the jury decide whether the deaths of <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' relatives were part of the same criminal episode as the shootings in <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION>. The defense had argued that to try <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> for the 14 killings, after he has already been convicted of the two deaths in <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION>, violates his right not to be tried twice for the same crime. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> denied the motion to let the jury decide the issue, just as he had earlier rejected the argument himself. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION> after a 40-minute shooting spree in which he wielded two .22 - caliber revolvers, wounding six people at four Two of those victims died. Authorities went to <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' house and, after several hours, broke into the house because the only door was barred from the inside but no one answered. They found five bodies in the house. The next day, they dug up seven bodies from a grave and found two more bodies, both babies, in the trunks of cars parked on <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' land. It was the worst mass murder in state history and one of the worst in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. Prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON> said he would ask for the death penalty. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, who presided over <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' earlier trial, will preside again and has decided that the prospective jurors will be questioned one-by-one to help ensure that a fair jury is chosen. He followed the same procedure in <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' trial in Ozark, where a jury was chosen in 1 -LCB- days. Defense lawyers <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> `` Doc'' <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said jury selection in the new trial may take three days. `` Not only can you not find 12 people in <LOCATION> Johnson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> who have n't heard about the case, you ca n't find 12 people in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, or maybe even the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. At the end of his first trial, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> startled <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> by waiving the right to appeal and asking to be executed as soon as possible. `` Let the torture and suffering in me end,'' <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> said. But his June 27 execution date was set aside because a Roman Catholic priest opposed to capital punishment, the Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Franz </PERSON>, filed motions contending that <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> was incompetent, that his decision to waive his appeal rights was not a knowing and intelligent act and that an appeal was mandatory. The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> turned down <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> on all three points, ruling that appeals were not mandatory if the defendant wanted to waive them and that <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> was both competent to do so and did so knowingly and intelligently. A federal court in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> is considering one aspect of <PERSON> Franz </PERSON>'s argument: whether the waiver was a knowing and intelligent act.

 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, bowing to opponents of a 51 percent congressional pay raise, announced today he would order a roll call vote on the issue Tuesdy before the boost can take effect. `` The majority has spoken and the majority will speak even more emphatically tomorrow ... The majority will rule,'' he said. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, D-Pa., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, predicted their would be `` no pay raise, no change'' in the lawmakers' $ 89,500 salary <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, made the announcement from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor after opponents of the $ 45,500 increase won a key procedural vote on the subject, defeating an effort by the Democratic leadership to adjourn the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> until Tuesday. An attempt to adjourn is normally such a routine procedure that it does not require a roll call vote. But in this case one was ordered, and its rejected on a 238-88 vote that showed opponents held the upper hand. The pay raise is scheduled to take effect at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> already has voted against the raise. The vote and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s subsequent announcement came after Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., who was presiding over the day's <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> session, refused to recognize a pay-raise opponent who wanted to introduce a resolution calling for a vote on the hike That set the stage for more than 30 minutes of barbed debate between the two sides. Rep. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, said the House was engaging in a `` shameful pay raise conspiracy'' by taking a money without voting for it. But Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, D-Wis., accused unnamed <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members of `` hypocrisy'' by speaking out publicly against the raise and indicating privately that they wanted the money Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON>, D-Calif., said she was going to be watching public opponents of the raise carefully to see whether they pocket the money `` I hope the press will be watching,'' added Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich. The proposed congressional pay is part of a package that would increase the salaries of federal judges as well as senior officials and managers in the executive branch. For members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the increase would amount to a raise from $ 89,500 to $ 135,000 a year. It was not immediately clear whether the vote that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> set for Tuesday would affect the recommended increases for judges and administration officials. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s decision to order the vote capped a remarkable retreat for the speaker. As recently as last week he insisted there would be no vote on the pay raise. He attempted to lessen the political damage by spreading the word that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would vote swiftly on legislation that would ban payment for honoraria for speeches and impose other curtailments on outside compensation. Later in the week, he conducted a private survey of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members and said the results showed they did not want a vote before the raise took effect. Despite that, random surveys by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and other organizations showed that sentiment was in favor of a vote. By late last week, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had said he would seek to scale the 50 percent pay raise back to 30 percent while banning honoraria. Throughout the maneuvering, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders lent their silent support to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s efforts to avoid a vote. Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., sat silently in his seat on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor during today's debate and vote The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 95-5 last Thursday to reject the entire raise for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and other top federal officials, but it will become law automatically Wednesday under a special procedure unless the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> also turns it down. The raise would apply to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, top <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration political appointees and judges, but the Constitution prevents reduction of judges' pay once they receive a raise. Under <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s proposal to let the raise become law, rank-and-file lawmakers would see their salaries rise Wednesday from $ 89,500 to $ 135,000. The speaker's plan would scale that back to $ 116,350. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> already has voted to offset the 51 percent raise partially by banning honoraria while the higher pay is in effect. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> plans to pass its own package to ban speaking fees and limit other outside income. Public reaction to the congressional pay raise has been overwhelmingly negative. Dozens of protesters shouting `` No pay hike,'' `` Read our lips'' and `` Hey Mr. <PERSON> Speaker </PERSON>, have n't you heard, 50 percent is quite absurd,'' Sunday night met <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members returning to Union Station from a weekend retreat at the luxurious <LOCATION> Greenbrier </LOCATION> resort in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. The lawmakers had earlier wondered aloud whether any strategy would satisfy the public _ and let them keep a pay raise. `` It'll sort of be like <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> said: We'll be rich for 15 minutes,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N </LOCATION>. While lawmakers wrestle with their own pay this week, they'll also be working on solutions to protect the money that millions of Americans have in shaky savings and loans About 350 insolvent S & amp; Ls remain operating after regulators `` rescued'' 205 last year with promissory notes and loss guarantees. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met over the weekend with his top advisers on the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L issue, and while he gave no clue to his intentions, administration officials said an announcement could come early this week. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, is expected to vote by midweek on the nomination of former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> to be secretary of defense. The vote will take place after the panel receives an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report on what congressional sources say are new allegations of drinking and womanizing by the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Republican. The 51 percent pay raise for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and executive branch political appointees could remain in effect for some time if the two houses are unable to resolve their differences. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> emphasized last week that his 30 percent rollback would n't be an increase at all _ but a dollar-for-dollar tradeoff _ for <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members who have been pocketing the honoraria maximum of $ 26,850 _ 30 percent of salary A Common Cause study showed that 108 House members were at or near the limit in 1987. While the 51 percent raise is law, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members giving up the maximum honoraria would gain $ 18,650 a year in the trade. Since senators have been allowed to retain 40 percent of their salary in honoraria _ $ 35,800 _ those at the maximum would gain $ 9,700 annually from the full raise.

 <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomonson </PERSON>, son-in-law of the late Vice President <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, was sentenced to nearly four years in prison today and ordered to pay back insurance companies he was found guilty of defrauding. `` I just want to express to my family and friends my sincere apologies for all the pain and suffering I have caused them,'' Solomonson told <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Devitt </PERSON> before sentencing. `` I'm an honest man, a loyal man and I never intended to cause harm to them.'' <PERSON> Solomonson </PERSON>, 47, was convicted in December on nine counts of fraud. Prosecution witnesses testified he diverted more than $ 1.5 million from his two <LOCATION> Edina </LOCATION> insurance agencies to his personal use. The jury found that he altered company books to hide the illegal transactions. He was found guilty of one count of bank fraud and eight counts of mail fraud. <PERSON> Devitt </PERSON> ordered Solomonson to pay $ 616,761 as full restitution to seven insurance companies which <PERSON> Devitt </PERSON> said `` are victims of defendant's crimes.'' Solomonson brokered insurance for the seven companies. In addition to the money taken from the insurance companies, he was convicted of taking money from the partners in his insurance agencies. <PERSON> Devitt </PERSON> sentenced Solomonson to 46 months on each of the nine counts, but ordered that they be served concurrently.

<HEAD>Rehnquist Calls for Reform To Stop Execution Delays ^Eds: For release

<TEXT>
 Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> called Monday for reform in a death penalty system that he said invites delays in executions that extend for years. <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>, in a speech prepared for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledged that federal courts have overturned many state convictions in death-penalty cases. The <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> legal defense and educational fund says about 40 percent of state death penalty convictions and sentences are overturned by federal courts. `` But to my mind the flaw in the present system is not that capital sentences are set aside by federal courts, but that litigation ultimately resolved in favor of the states takes literally years and years and years,'' <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said. The chief justice cited the most recent execution in the country, that of serial killer <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on Jan. 24, as an example of a system of death penalty appeals that is often `` chaotic and drawn out unnecessarily.'' <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> noted that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> turned down three separate emergency pleas in Bundy's behalf hours before he was put to death. `` All three of these actions were being prosecuted simultaneously on the day before the execution of a prisoner who had been on death row for nine years,'' he said. `` Surely it would be a bold person to say that this system could not be improved.'' <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>, renewing an appeal he made about a year ago to a conference of state chief justices, urged the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> to support reform of the death penalty appeal process. Retired Supreme Court Justice <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> was appointed by <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> to head a committee of federal judges looking into the question, and the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> also has a panel studying the issue. <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said he is not calling for a drastic curtailing of the right of convicted killers to appeal to the federal courts for help _ a process known as federal habeas corpus. Rather, the chief justice said, he is seeking `` modest changes which will impose some structure'' on a system in which the average time elapsed between the commission of a crime and execution is eight years nationally and more than 13 years in some states. There are more than 2,000 prisoners on death row nationwide. Since 1976, when the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> allowed states to reinstate the death penalty, there have been 106 executions nationwide. More than 11,000 federal court appeals were filed last year in death penalty cases. <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> endorsed a requirement that all such appeals be consolidated in `` one petition and filed within a reasonable time'' after state court appeals have been exhausted. He also said states could promote speedier resolution of death penalty cases by giving incentives for lawyers to represent those filing federal appeals. On another subject, <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> reiterated his endorsement of a 50 percent increase in pay for federal judges that will take effect Wednesday unless blocked before then by both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The judicial pay increase is part of a package that includes a similar hike for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` These increases simply restore to federal judges the purchasing power that has been eaten away by inflation over the past 20 years,'' <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said. `` They are essential if we are to continue to attract from the financially greener fields of private practice the sort of experienced and capable lawyers whom we want as judges.'' <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> also proposed some changes aimed at reducing the workload for the federal courts. For example, he said someone from one state suing someone from another state should not have an automatic right to take the case to federal court on that basis.

<HEAD>Productivity Unchanged In Fourth Quarter; Up 1.4 Percent For 1988</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By John King</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 American workers increased their productivity by 1.4 percent last year, the government reported Monday, an improvement over 1987 that nonetheless revived doubts about economic projections at the heart of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s spending plans. The 1.4 percent gain in non-farm business productivity was up from 0.8 percent in 1987 and matched the average 1.4 percent annual gain experienced since the end of the 1981-82 recession, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported. Increased productivity _ getting each worker to produce more each hour he or she is on the job _ is vital to economic growth without inflation, particularly given the current squeeze in the labor market. Total business productivity, including farming, fell at a 2.0 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 1988 because of a drop in farm productivity. Manufacturers reported a 3.2 percent increase in productivity last year, down from 3.4 percent in 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. In his final budget, former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> forecasted a 1.2 percent productivity gain in 1989, a 1.8 percent rise in 1990, a 2 percent jump in 1991 and 2.1 percent increases the next three years. That forecast, adopted by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> fiscal advisers, calls for average annual productivity gains of 1.9 percent for 1989-1994. But analysts said there was nothing in the 1988 productivity report to suggest that type of improvement would occur, particularly at a time of slow labor force growth. Meeting those targets would be essential to reaching the more than 3 percent average annual economic growth called for in the budget forecast without a significant increase in inflation. Indeed, the budget blueprint assumes higher productivity and lower inflation, something most analysts say is improbable. `` Nobody believes that forecast, not even the guys who wrote it,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` There really is no chance of productivity doubling in the next few years, under any conceivable circumstances that I can see.'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> attributed the overall productivity gain in 1988 to the rapid economic expansion early in the year, citing unchanged productivity in the fourth quarter and the smaller 0.7 percent change in the final quarter compared to the same period of 1987. `` That is extremely sluggish growth in productivity,'' said <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> last week also questioned the likelihood of 3 percent or higher annual economic growth and declining inflation as assumed in the budget forecast. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> is expected to move to tighten the central bank's reins on credit _ thereby slowing economic growth _ when its <ORGANIZATION> Open </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meets this week to set 1989 monetary targets. If, as expected, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> moves to slow economic growth to about 2.5 percent a year, productivity would be affected as well and gains in the next five years likely will average 1.4 percent as they have the past six years, said economist <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinner </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, - based forecasting firm `` What happens when the economy slows down is that you get a cyclical reduction in productivity,'' <PERSON> Brinner </PERSON> said. `` That's a problem for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration.''

 A stripper who said she performed sex acts while television evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> watched denied Monday that she made up her story to cash in on publicity surrounding a similar story last year. <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kampen </PERSON> said she received anonymous offers of hush money to stop publication of the allegations, which appeared last week in Penthouse magazine, and received threats before and after publication. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said last week there was no truth to the story and <PERSON> Kampen </PERSON>'s employer called it a `` pornographic fairy tale'' invented for financial gain. `` Every word that's written in this magazine is true,'' <PERSON> Kampen </PERSON> declared Monday at a news conference. She and a magazine spokeswoman declined to say how much she received for her cooperation, but <PERSON> Kampen </PERSON> said, `` It was such a small sum of money that it really is inconsequential.'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> last February confessed to an undisclosed sin involving a prostitute and was later defrocked by the Assemblies of God ministry. She said she offered to tell her story to reporter <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> for free, and did not receive the money until long after she talked to him in the spring of 1988. `` If I was going to make something up, to cash in on something, I surely would n't have made this up,'' she said at a news conference at <LOCATION> Penthouse </LOCATION> offices, noting that the story `` does not exactly put me in a good light.''

<TEXT>
 Former Soviet political prisoners appealed to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday to pardon <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> and his wife, who were convicted in a spy case involving <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` Please grant them their freedom and, should they wish to come to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, we will gratefully receive them into our community,'' said their petition. The appeal was presented to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> at a rally that drew around 50 people, about half of them former Soviet refuseniks _ Jews who have been denied emigration. The rally was sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisoners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zion </ORGANIZATION>, a group uniting immigrants who have been in Soviet prisons for Zionist activity. `` <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> understood the tragic history of our people and acted with desperate urgency to protect the people of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' the petition said. `` His course of action, though unwise, was not intended to hurt his country but to prevent another tragedy for the remaining Jewish people.'' <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> <PERSON> Begun </PERSON>, the former refusenik who waged a 17-year battle to emigrate and spent a decade in and out of jail, stood near <LOCATION> Ida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nudel </LOCATION>, known as the `` guardian angel'' of refuseniks before her 1987 emigration. They held a sign with portraits of <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson-Pollard </PERSON>. The appeal was the latest in a series from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seeking freedom for <PERSON> Polland </PERSON> and his wife. Last month, the Israeli parliament passed a resolution urging they be freed. Miss <PERSON> Nudel </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> army radio the <ORGANIZATION> Pollards </ORGANIZATION> were `` hostages in a foreign country'' and appealed for better medical treatment for Mrs. <PERSON> Henderson-Pollard </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON>, arrested in 1985, is serving a life sentence in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for selling top-secret military documents to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Bond Program Would Help Young Families Afford Homes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 First-time homebuyers would be guaranteed a down payment by investing in state bonds under a program Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said Monday is designed to give everyone a crack at the American dream. `` Anything government can do to help the next generation realize their dreams is extremely important. I think this program will not only work, but sweep the country,'' <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said of the <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ownership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> he plans to announce Tuesday night in his State of the State address. Details of the program still are being worked out, but <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said the goal of the program he hopes will begin this year is to help young families save the 5 percent or 10 percent down payment they need to buy a house. Prospective homeowners would give the state a lump sum or make monthly payments to buy tax-free bonds, like an $ 800 million issue approved by voters in November for environmental cleanup and parks. At the end of a contract that could range from three to 10 years, the families would have enough for a down payment for a house in a price range they chose at the outset. If prices go up faster than expected, the state would make up the difference; if they go up slower, the state would keep the difference. The approachh is similar to the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Education Trust, in which parents pay a lump sum to guarantee their child's tuition at one of 15 universities or 29 community colleges. Officials estimate college tuition could ach $ 25,000 in 18 years; It cost about $ 6,800 to enroll a newborn in the trust last year. More than 40,000 children were enrolled for a total investment of $ 265 million. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> officials believe the program can be started without approval from the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>. `` The state is not spending money at all. You're guaranteeing, that's all,'' <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said. `` In this case, you're also using tax-free bonds that we would have to pay for anyway. `` Usually, tax-free bonds are sold in denominations of $ 5,000, $ 10,000 or $ 100,000. In this program, we're going to sell them in small units so young couples can buy them and have the tax-free status of the interest earned.'' The program will help reverse the trend of declining home ownership among young couples and a declining rate of savings, he said. `` It deals with a whole range of problems I've seen in our society. We've got a whole new generation of people that may not have the same opportunities that we have.''

 <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the wife of Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, has entered an alcohol treatment program, according to a statement issued by the governor today that blamed the problem on the letdown after his failed presidential campaign. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 52, has had a history of addictions and chemical dependency but was never known to be dependent on alcohol until the statement was released this afternoon. In July 1987, Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> announced that she had recovered from a 26-year dependency on diet pills. The governor's wife said she had conquered her addiction to amphetamines, which she hid from her husband, after undergoing treatment at a <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> facility in 1982. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said today that his wife entered the <LOCATION> Edgehill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> facility in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, Sunday evening and will stay there for about 30 days. `` Until shortly after election day on Nov. 8, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> had never had a problem with alcohol,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Unfortunately, a combination of physical exhaustion, the stress of the campaign effort and the post-election letdown all combined to create a situation in which, on a limited number of occasions while at home, she has used alcohol in excessive quantities,'' the governor said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' press office did not answer questions about the statement but said the governor would hold a news conference later today. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who last month abruptly announced that he would not seek a fourth term as govenor, said in his statement that Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> decided to enter the well-known clinic voluntarily and said he and his family supported her decision. `` We know how loved and respected she is both here in the commonwealth and across the nation _ and she is grateful for the love and support she has received from so many good and decent people,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who won high marks as a political campaigner during her husband's 1988 presidential effort, has been prominent in the fight to educate youngsters against the perils of drug and alcohol abuse. Since the presidential defeat, Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has launched a new career as an author and lecturer and has not appeared at her husband's side on several occasions when she might have been expected. On Jan. 3, for example, when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made the surprise announcement that he would not seek a fourth term as governor, some observers remarked on the fact that Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was not present. Last week, the governor and first lady celebrated the birth of their first grandchild _ <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the daughter of <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. In July 1987, Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ with her husband at her side _ revealed that she had been drug-free for five years after seeking treatment at the <ORGANIZATION> Hazelton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Centre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said she began taking mild amphetamines in 1956 as a teen-ager to control her weight She continued the practice secretively for two decades and said her husband did not know of her dependency when they married in June 1963. The governor first discovered her drug problem in 1974. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said they discussed the issue and that she stopped taking the pills for a while. In 1982, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> discovered that his wife was again taking pills, and the couple decided that Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> should seek the clinic's help She entered the 30-day <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> program on July 14, 1982. In 1982, the public was told that Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was suffering from hepatitis. When she announced in 1987 the real reason for her disappearance from the public scene five years earlier, she said: `` after five years of being chemical-free, I feel strong and confident in myself and what I've done. And secondly, and as important or more important, one of the tenets of recovering is helping other people. It's important for me to talk about this publicly, to try to help other people who have the same kind of dependency.'' <LOCATION> Edgehill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> was founded in 1980 and is described as the largest private alcohol treatment center in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. New patients are put through a detoxification center, then transferred to other rooms for the balance of the 28-day program. It includes intensive counseling and emphasis on rest and proper diet.

<TEXT>
 After 142 years, the <LOCATION> Jonesville </LOCATION> post office finally has outgrown T.C. <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON>'s general store. The post office is among the nation's oldest in an original site and has been used several times as a movie location because of its old-fashioned look. But stardom does n't turn the head of its postmaster, who once refused to let a film crew take down the American flag flying over the building. Now it's combination-lock boxes, hand-sorter slots and original hand canceler will all soon be part of the past. Land for a new building has been selected about 500 feet to the north, and the <ORGANIZATION> postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> is getting ready to take bids. Postmaster <PERSON> Reba </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> says she hates to move out of the colorful general store that draws visitors from across the nation, but she says a new building is an absolute necessity for this East <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> town of about 400. `` We're bursting out the seams,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> said last week. `` I'm literally crawling over the mail to get out the door.'' But Mrs. <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON>, who has been postmaster four years, says she hopes the general store's owners will keep the post office intact as a well-preserved page of American history. Mrs. <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> still cancels <LOCATION> Jonesville </LOCATION> mail with the post office's original hand canceler Also intact is an old-fashioned service window with metal bars that has been featured in several movies. The post office was once saved from closing by Mrs. <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Emma </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON> Mrs. <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON>, whose husband owns the general store and still operates it, said she took the job in 1949 after learning she was the only one in town with a <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> rating. `` I had to take it because I was the only one that was qualified,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON> said. `` We knew that if it closed, we'd never get another one I agreed to keep it for six months _ but I stayed 38 years.'' She initially made $ 1,000 annually as the <LOCATION> Jonesville </LOCATION> postmaster. Mrs. <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON> said her salary had increased 25-fold by the time she retired. Mrs. <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON> said she hates to see progress force the post office out of her husband's store but said her family is part of the reason it has to move. `` My son owns an oil company and his mail volume has really increased,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> is only the fourth <LOCATION> Jonesville </LOCATION> postmaster since World War I. She had a run-in several years ago with the people filming a remake of `` The Long Hot Summer,'' which starred <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cybill </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Robards </PERSON>. She said she let the production crew pretty much have the run of the post office, but drew a hard line when she saw them taking down the post office's American flag. They explained the halyard was clanging against the flagpole in a brisk <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> wind and was ruining the movie's sound track. They begged her to let them take it down, but she was staunch in her refusal. `` I told them they could just have someone shinny up the pole and hold it down if they wanted it quiet, but it was n't coming down,'' she said.

<HEAD>Groups Seek Reappraisal of 1956 Revolt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Official and independent groups Monday increased pressure on Hungarian leaders to accept a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> reformer's appraisal of the 1956 revolt as a popular uprising. <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> state news agency carried statements giving unqualified backing to Politburo member <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>. He stunned Hungarians nine days ago when he said in a radio interview the 1956 revolt, crushed by Soviet tanks, was a popular uprising. For three decades, the revolt officially has been branded a counterrevolution instigated from abroad to destroy communism. <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>'s statement touched off differences with other party leaders. <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> released statements of the official <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and revived Smallholders' Party as well as of an alliance of 15 independent political groups, including the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> and Hungarian Democratic Forum. They appear designed to bolster <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, after the reformer was rebuked by party chief <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, other senior officials and the <ORGANIZATION> Ferenc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Muennich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, a club of conservative communists opposing <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s fast-moving reform movement. Apparently reacting to his critics in the party, <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> toned down his statement Saturday, telling a workers' meeting `` popular uprising ... is not a final formula or a verdict but one recommended ... in the spirit of reconciliation with the people.'' <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> has to answer for his stand at a special <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting Friday. The Smallholders said they consider October 1956 `` as a national uprising and a revolution against Stalinism,'' and find <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>'s reappraisal `` a compromise acceptable for society. The other independent groups said political cooperation with the communists is conceivable only `` if there is a just historical appraisal and a revised outlook on the popular uprising unleashed in 1956 against the Stalinist party state.'' Over the weekend, the daughter of revolt leader <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> and widows of two <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> colleagues executed for their part in the 1956 uprising, appeared on television for the first time in 32 years. They called for a public reburial of their relatives. <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> was executed by the Soviets, whom the Hungarian leadership invited to crush the revolt. The official Hungarian Roman Catholic weekly <ORGANIZATION> Uj </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ember </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, reported that the 1948 trial and life sentencing of the late Cardinal <PERSON> Jozsef </PERSON> <PERSON> Mindszenty </PERSON> was rigged. <PERSON> Uj </PERSON> <PERSON> Ember </PERSON> said published documents show his trial `` was carried out according to a pre-planned and prepared concept.'' The former primate of the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> was arrested in 1948 as an enemy of communism and, following a humiliating trial, was sentenced to life imprisonment under false charges of high treason. In 1956, the cardinal was freed from prison by Hungarian revolutionaries. After the uprising, he found permanent shelter in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Legation in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>. In 1971, under an agreement between the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and the Hungarian government, <PERSON> Mindszenty </PERSON> left his asylum at the American mission and after a short stay in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> settled in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, where he died in May 1975 at age 83.

<HEAD>Attorney General: Stop Children Societies From Acting as Police Forces</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Outdated state laws aimed at preventing child abuse have allowed some organizations to act as illegal police forces, glorified gun clubs and fronts for drug rings, the state attorney general said Monday. Legislators should repeal the 1875 law that authorizes creation of societies for the prevention of cruelty to children, Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said in his report on a year-long investigation. `` Many of them have become para-police organizations with no legitimate purpose having to do with children at all,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. Some groups have cars and uniforms, patrolling the streets and arresting people for traffic violations, according to the report. Members deceive people into thinking they're police officers and have caches of firearms. Federal drug agents taped a conversation of a <LOCATION> Sullivan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> member bragging that he uses <ORGANIZATION> SPCC </ORGANIZATION> credentials to make drug dealing easier, the attorney general said. The 1875 law was passed at a time when government agencies played no role in child protection. Lawmakers gave <ORGANIZATION> SPCC </ORGANIZATION> officers peace officer status, meaning they can carry handguns and make arrests, and gave them the right to enforce `` all laws relating to or affecting children,'' said <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>' report. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> has 24 licensed SPCCs. Seven, all formed before 1920, act as social service agencies and do n't use peace officer powers. The remainder, all but one formed after 1972, `` either have a distinct law enforcement orientation ... or do nothing at all,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. Five of these have dissolved and five are in the process. There are only three such societies outside <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said groups in <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> have applications pending for new <ORGANIZATION> SPCC </ORGANIZATION>'s, but he's opposing them in court. He is calling for the deletion of <ORGANIZATION> SPCC </ORGANIZATION> agents from the list of peace officers, and is proposing that the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> be given the authority to supervise all <ORGANIZATION> SPCC </ORGANIZATION>'s. Among the problems detailed in the report were: _ A <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> society that searched a 16-year-old boy at gunpoint and bound him to a chair overnight <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> obtained an injunction barring that group from detaining suspects anywhere but in jails. _ A <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> society was investigating the illegal sale of alcohol to minors in bars _ <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> society members pulled cars over on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> highways, in one case drawing guns and telling the person they were police _ A <LOCATION> Sullivan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> society member said in a tape-recorded conversation that his status gave him access to weapons and less scrutiny when stopped by police He was arrested on charges of selling cocaine to an undercover federal agent. Investigators found no evidence that any organizations obstructed child abuse investigations. If someone with a legitimate abuse complaint calls one of the societies, they're generally told to contact a social service agency. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellman </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> SPCC </ORGANIZATION>, criticized <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> and said the state needed more <ORGANIZATION> SPCC </ORGANIZATION> services, not less. These organizations give people an option when other state agencies have failed, he said.

<HEAD>Millions Take a Dip for Salvation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DILIP GANGULY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ALLAHABAD, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Millions of barefoot Hindus from across <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> jostled and pushed their way to take a dip at the confluence of two sacred rivers Monday in hopes it would bring them eternal salvation. An estimated 15 million people bathed at river banks in this central Indian city during the day, many starting as early as 4 a.m., authorities said. Hindus believe that <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Brahma </PERSON>, the creator of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and one of the ruling trinity of a pantheon of gods and goddesses, awakes at that hour. The bathing is the high point of the seven-week <PERSON> Kumbh </PERSON> <PERSON> Mela </PERSON> festival, which according to the <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> is the largest religious gathering on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. `` The grand show was a grand success,'' said <PERSON> Ravindra </PERSON> <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON>, the chief administrator of <LOCATION> Allahabad </LOCATION>. `` It was a difficult day for us but it's over.'' His relief came from the fact that the fair _ a logistical nightmare at the best of times _ had ended without any major problems. Stampedes and armed confrontations between different Hindu sects have claimed hundreds of lives in previous fairs. In 1954, at least 800 people died in a stampede. Police said four people died Monday. Two were drowned when their boat capsized in <LOCATION> midstream </LOCATION> and two others died of natural causes, said Superintendent <PERSON> Vibhuti </PERSON> <PERSON> Narain </PERSON> <PERSON> Rai </PERSON>. Authorities make arrangements for the supply of 13,000 gallons of milk, 10 tons of butter and 5 tons of cheese to the pilgrims every day. Allahabad city officials have also stockpiled 10,000 tons of wheat, 4,000 tons of rice and 2,000 tons of sugar. The <PERSON> Kumbh </PERSON> <PERSON> Mela </PERSON> is celebrated every 12 years when a rare planetary configuration occurs: Jupiter in Taurus, the sun and moon in <LOCATION> Capricorn </LOCATION>, and a series of complicated calculations of Hindu astrology. Monday is considered the climax of the festival, which started Jan. 14, because it is also the day of the new moon, another good omen. The festival takes its name of <PERSON> Kumbh </PERSON> <PERSON> Mela </PERSON> from Hindu mythology when the gods seized a pot of nectar that made them invincible in their war against the demons. A drop of nectar from the gods' pot is thought to have fallen at <LOCATION> Allahabad </LOCATION> where the <LOCATION> Ganges </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jamuna </PERSON> rivers come together. A bath at the spot where the nectar fell is supposed to bring salvation from the cycle of birth and rebirth. The pilgrims were a diverse lot. Holy men from Himalayan cave homes and naked recluses from forest dens came to the river banks in chariots and on camels draped with brightly embroidered cloths. Most trekked to the bathing spots but some came on horseback and the more affluent in Mercedes salons. The bathing at the <PERSON> Kumbh </PERSON> <PERSON> Mela </PERSON> began with processions of holy men, their order determined from days of yore according to the importance of their sects, dipping at the confluence of the <LOCATION> Ganges </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Yamuna </LOCATION> and the mythical Swaraswati. The Swaraswati can not be seen, but Hindus believe it flows beneath the Earth's surface where the two other rivers meet. The rivers turned muddy brown and foul smelling as more bathers immersed themselves. Many used empty liquor bottles and pots to carry the holy water home. `` Either these people are crazy or there must be something we ca n't see or understand,'' said <PERSON> Nina </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` It is vibrating,'' she said, pointing to the barefoot pilgrims walking to the junction of the Ganges and <LOCATION> Jamuna </LOCATION> rivers. She was among dozens of Americans who had come to see the unique religious spectacle. For the faithful, the bathing is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. `` I planned this trip five years back when we had a good crop,'' said <PERSON> Sarju </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahato </PERSON>, a farmer from <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> state, as he tended the blisters on his two sons' feet. `` We saved money and came here.'' <PERSON> Ganesh </PERSON> <PERSON> Dasgupta </PERSON>, a railroad worker from <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>, brought his family of six and said with satisfaction: `` I have got what I wanted. A bath here is equal to visiting all the pilgrim centers in the country.''

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will use diplomacy to export its Islamic revolution, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said Monday, but he appeared unwilling to use that persuasion on <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s biggest foes, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will hold direct peace talks with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> `` soon,'' but they will make no progress unless <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> troops withdraw from Iranian territory, <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> told a news conference. He also said better relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are possible only if <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> changes its hostile posture toward <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s revolution `` We have a concept and we are going to continue the policy to export the revolution,'' said <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>. `` But this does n't mean we're going to export the revolution with a gun. `` You're trying to make other people in the world to be Western-oriented,'' he told scores of foreign reporters in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> for 10th anniversary celebrations of the revolution. `` We're going to do the same on the basis of our Islamic beliefs and concepts,'' he said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has been restoring relations with Western countries and its gulf neighbors in a new open-door policy aimed at ending a decade of self-imposed isolation. `` Except for the Palestine-occupying regime -LRB- <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> -RRB- and the racist South African regime, and precluding American sabotage, we desire good relations with other countries of the world,'' <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> hierarchy is deeply divided over restoring links with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, severed in 1979. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s so-called pragmatists have united, however, to make it clear <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has backed off the militant export of its fundamentalist revolution since the Aug. 20 U.N.-sponsored cease-fire in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s eight-year war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said peace talks with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> were effectively deadlocked, and <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> was making no effort to get them going again. `` If <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> adopts a stubborn attitude and refuses to retreat the talks will get nowhere,'' he said. He gave no date for resuming the talks, deadlocked since last November over the issue of troop withdrawals. Both <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> are due in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> this week for talks with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> that could bring the two face-to-face. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> sent a letter to <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> saying <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> rejects any Iranian preconditions for resuming talks, the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. <ORGANIZATION> INA </ORGANIZATION> reported the letter said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is ready to cooperate with the secretary-general in a `` constructive manner'' to break the deadlock. <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> accused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of neglecting its obligations under the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution by insisting on a troop withdrawal. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claims <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> still holds 390 square miles of its territory. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> refuses to withdraw without a guarantee of freedom of navigation in the gulf. Airlines that suspended their flights because of the war have begun to fly back to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Alitalia </ORGANIZATION>, the Italian airline, announced Monday it is resuming separate weekly flights to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> this week. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> has been spruced up for the revolution's anniversary. Buildings are draped in flags and sparkle at night with cascades of colored lights in sharp contrast to celebrations during the war, when blackouts were in effect to combat Iraqi missile strikes.

<TEXT>
 The author of a landmark law limiting trade with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is proposing a relaxation of the curbs in light of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s agreement to allow more Jewish emigration, according to a letter released Monday. The letter by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanik </PERSON>, a former congressman from <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> who co-sponsored the 1974 Jackson-Vanik Amendment, reflects a fledgling movement among legislators and Jewish groups for a reassessment of restrictions on trade with the Soviets. The Jan. 30 letter from <ORGANIZATION> Vanik </ORGANIZATION>, now in private law practice, was written to <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.

The group is one of several prominent Jewish organizations advocating a re-examination of the 1974 amendment that imposes high tariffs on imports from any Communist country denying its citizens the right to emigrate. The amendment, which had been originated by the late senator <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, was designed to stop Soviet restrictions on Jews seeking to emigrate and has served as leverage in the hands of successive administrations in their dealings with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The amendment allows the president to recommend to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a waiver of the restrictions for at least 18 months if the Soviets or other Communist countries stop their emigration restrictions. Over the years, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> have benefited from such waivers. Critics of the amendment argue that whatever improvements have occurred since then in Soviet emigration policy have been the result of internal reforms in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> or developments in superpower arms control negotiations rather than the Jackson-Vanik law. `` I disagree,'' <ORGANIZATION> Vanik </ORGANIZATION> said in an interview. `` I think the amendment has done many people a great deal of good.'' Seeking to take advantage of the economic openness to outsiders instituted by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business leaders have in recent months launched a campaign to form joint ventures that would give them a foothold in the largely untapped Soviet market. <ORGANIZATION> Vanik </ORGANIZATION> and other experts agree that a waiver of the Jackson-Vanik bill would not result in much immediate trade but would improve overall relations and the climate for doing business. `` It's a way of sending them a signal, saying we're encouraged by what you're doing, keep it up,'' <ORGANIZATION> Vanik </ORGANIZATION> said But the push for a waiver, which is written into the amendment, would have to come from the Jewish community, which has been the main proponent and beneficiary of the bill, <ORGANIZATION> Vanik </ORGANIZATION> said. The World Jewish <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> projects that at the current level of emigration, some 38,000 Jews will be allowed to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> this year. This compares with the record 51,320 allowed out in 1979 and a record low of some 900 in 1986. Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who has a large Jewish constituency, said in a recent speech that it was `` only a matter of time'' until the waiver is enacted if the emigration levels maintain their current pace. Organization officials say they will formally consider their position regarding a waiver of the Jackson-Vanik law at a May 7 meeting in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. But they indicate that if the Soviets allow direct flights of emigrants from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, `` that would create the environment for immediate Jewish support of a Jackson-Vanik waiver,'' said Executive Director <PERSON> Elan </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. The Soviets, who broke off relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1967, have refused to allow direct flights, sending the Jewish emigres to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has complained that this practice allows Jews to proceed from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and other points rather than going to the Jewish state. The new administration has yet to take a stand on the subject. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> reiterated the view of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration that `` this is the kind of thing, were it to happen, would require a very strong consensus among the administration, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.''

<HEAD>Government Bans Display of Weapons at Neo-Nazi Rallies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The government on Monday cracked down for the first time on the country's most powerful white extremist group, banning the display of firearms at meetings of the <ORGANIZATION> Afrikaner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> imposed the ban on the neo-Nazi group under the same emergency regulations used to restrict many anti-apartheid movements. Meetings of the resistance movement, known by its Afrikaans initials as the <ORGANIZATION> AWB </ORGANIZATION>, were `` characterized by emotion-laden speeches ... in which remarks about the use of violence were uttered,'' <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said. `` Often, statements are made at such gatherings which disrupt the relationship between the different races and kindle a climate of animosity and polarization,'' he said. The movement was founded in 1973 and does not disclose its membership, but regularly draws thousands of whites to its rallies. Many members wear swastika-like emblems on their khaki uniforms, and the group's leader, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> TerreBlanche </PERSON>, often ends fiery speeches with a Hitler-style salute. At a leadership meeting Jan. 21 in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> TerreBlanche </PERSON> loyalists repudiated a challenge to his leadership, the chief instructor of the the group's paramilitary unit was on guard outside the auditorium with an automatic rifle slung over his shoulder. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>'s statement said dissension within the movement `` has increased the possibility of violence.'' The minister also said the government was considering broader steps, including a ban on possession of weapons at all political and cultural gatherings. At present, many whites and a handful of blacks have permits which allow them to carry weapons virtually anywhere. The challenge to <PERSON> TerreBlanche </PERSON>'s leadership began in December after he was accused of having an extramarital relationship with <PERSON> Jani </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON>, a former model who writes a column for the nationally circulated <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> TerreBlanche </PERSON>, who is married, has denied any improper relationship with Ms. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON>. Four senior members of the movement demanded his resignation, and one of them accused <PERSON> TerreBlanche </PERSON> of womanizing and excessive drinking _ charges <PERSON> TerreBlanche </PERSON> denied. The government recently has been criticized for failing to take tough action against extreme-right whites involved in a series of racist incidents across the country. Last year, the government banned a small white-supremacist group called the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, and was accused of lacking the courage to act against the more powerful movement. The group contends the government's limited political reforms will lead to a takeover by the disenfranchised black majority.

<TEXT>
 Talks that began Monday between Solidarity and the government likely will produce results, some experts say, because the once-bitter enemies now have no choice but to agree. For the first time since the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> consolidated power after World War II, a cross-section of the opposition has begun to negotiate openly with authorities over how <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> should be governed, how its political system should be reformed and how its economy should be managed. `` I am proud that such an unprecedented event in socialist countries is taking place in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Paluszewska </PERSON>, an engineer standing outside the palace where the talks are being held. `` This may be really the last chance which may save <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> from bloodshed.'' The opposition is represented by Solidarity chief <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, scholars, writers and intellectuals. The pro-Solidarity delegation numbers 25. There are 57 seats at the round table built specially for the talks, and the rest are filled by representatives of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, two Communist-allied groups, government officials, members of the official OPZZ trade union alliance, intellectuals linked to the party and three <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> officials. Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, who as interior minister is <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s top police officer, is the host. `` I am an optimist by nature. I believe that the debates ... will be successful,'' he said before the talks began. Although authorities vowed after the 1981 martial-law crackdown that Solidarity would never be allowed to operate legally again, the talks are aimed at achieving just that. Officials, faced with a deteriorating economy and tired of the political stalemate with Solidarity, decided in bitter debate at a party meeting last month to make peace with the opposition. They said they hoped the decision would win them public support as they seek further economic sacrifices from a weary populace. They also anticipate a larger measure of sympathy from potential lenders in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> desperately needs money for investments but Western loans, even for small commercial transactions, virtually ceased after the martial-law decree. As the price for legalizing Solidarity, authorities want the opposition to back economic reforms and to participate in the Communist-dominated government and parliament. It is this demand that causes the greatest uneasiness among Solidarity veterans. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has vowed not to accept any compromise that would inhibit the union's independence. `` I think it is of historic significance,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandelbaum </PERSON>, an expert on <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> relations with the Council on Foreign Relations, said of the talks during an interview in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> last week. Noting that the Cold War began when the communists seized power in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> after World War II, he said cooperation between the Polish government and the opposition could help ease East-West tensions. Economic pressures make the move toward national agreement a necessity, <PERSON> Mandelbaum </PERSON> said. `` If things go on, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> would be a Third World country. This awareness has forced political changes,'' he said. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Gati </PERSON>, an eastern European expert and professor at <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Polish </LOCATION> authorities seem `` ready to reverse themselves and come to terms with Polish political realities, and it is wonderful news.'' `` <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> can not be governed without Solidarity,'' he said. `` It can be ruled, with some difficulty, without Solidarity.'' But, <PERSON> Gati </PERSON> added, Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> `` has learned that ruling by itself is simply not enough.'' He cited several factors leading to the government's decision to sit down with Solidarity: strong support in society for Solidarity, Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s commitment to reform, the continued decline of the economy and the appointment of a new prime minister, <PERSON> mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> f. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, in a government shakeup last fall. <PERSON> Gati </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> is `` as shrewd at they come,'' and recognizes the logic of talking with Solidarity.

 Angry relatives of Flight 103 victims accused the federal government and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> on Monday of negligence before the bombing that killed 270 people and of insensitivity afterward. Thirty relatives, some with photographs of their lost loved ones pinned to their clothes, chiefly demanded an accounting of why the government had not made public a terrorist threat that such a flight would be bombed. The group also demanded the resignation of <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, saying he had failed to maintain security, and asked that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> investigate the circumstances of the Pan Am attack. But in an outpouring of emotion and frustration, the relatives voiced a litany of other complaints, ranging from their inability to recover their loved ones' personal effects to the handling of the victims' remains. <PERSON> Colleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, described how her family watched as 10 caskets, one containing her brother's body, were unloaded by forklift from a plane in a livestock cargo area at <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>. `` There was no representative of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> there. No one even spoke English,'' she said tearfully at a news conference. `` And that is how my brother came home.'' The relatives, in a statement, complained of `` utter silence'' by high government officials _ no condolence, no attendance at memorial services, no answers to letters. They suggested officials were seeking to conceal mishandling of the threat that preceded the bombing. `` I am outraged that the most democratic country in the world, so they claim, keeps information from people to choose when to die,'' said <PERSON> Marina </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Larracoechea </PERSON>, whose sister was killed on the flight. `` A life for an airline ticket is an extremely high price to pay.'' The government told airlines and embassies of a threat that terrorists would bomb a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flight from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> in December, but it did not warn the public. Officials said they get such unconfirmed threats on a daily basis and would cripple the airline industry by announcing them publicly. The relatives called that policy `` immoral and possibly criminal.'' While the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> receives perhaps 500 threats annually, fewer than 25 are considered `` high-level'' threats, as the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> threat apparently was, they said. The relatives angrily suggested that the government had widely advised federal employees not to take flights such as <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> 103, noting that it had more than 150 empty seats at the height of the busy Christmas season. The New York-bound flight, which originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and changed to a larger plane in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, exploded over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, on Dec. 21. All 259 aboard died, as did 11 on the ground. <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, noted that the threat had not identified a specific flight and that <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> had increased its security after receiving the warning. She said the number of vacant seats was n't unusual. Ms. <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> had assigned each family an individual company official to serve as its liaison. She said she had not known of the specific complaint by Ms. <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON> on the handling of her brother's remains. An <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman did not return two telephone messages. At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, spokeswoman <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said she wanted to see the relatives' statement before commenting.

 President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> on Monday called for tougher economic sanctions on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and urged the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to increase the strength of its peacekeeping force for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The Zimbabwean leader told foreign ministers from the eight-nation <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that the international campaign for comprehensive and mandatory sanctions aimed at ending <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>'s legal system of racial separation must be intensified. `` Friends, allies and sympathizers of <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> must be told clearly that the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> will not allow this call to be suppressed by anyone, until <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is ready to dismantle her evil system,'' said <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>, who also is current chairman of the 101-nation Non-Aligned Movement. He was opening a three-day meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> committee seeking ways to increase external pressure on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s government and bolster black-governed neighbors threatened by South African destabilization Several of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s neighbors are members of the 48-member <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION>, a loose association of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and its former colonies. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is not a member of the committee because Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> opposes sanctions. <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> applauded the U.S.-brokered peace plan plotting independence for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, after U.N.-sponsored elections in November. But he said African nations remain `` deeply suspicious'' of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s part in the agreement, which <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> also signed, and fear attempts to weaken the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> role in the territory <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> has administered since World War 1. `` <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> must never be allowed to manipulate the election processes directly or indirectly in her favor. All loopholes must therefore be closed to her,'' he said. `` Any optimism this agreement may have generated must be tempered by anxiety about potential hurdles and land mines,'' <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> said. The Zimbabwean is an outspoken critic of suggestions favored by the five permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to reduce the <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> peacekeeping force from 7,500 to 4,650 men to save costs. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pay 58 percent of all peacekeeping costs. Commonwealth Secretary-General <PERSON> Shridath </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramphal </PERSON> told the session that reducing the force will save the five about $ 160 million. This was the cost of about seven fighter aircraft or two hours of the collective military spending of the five major powers, <PERSON> Ramphal </PERSON> said. He described the proposed cuts as an emasculation of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s role in <LOCATION> Nambia </LOCATION> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s external affairs minister and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> group, said the meeting will review ways to strengthen the international arms embargo against <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, measures against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in world money markets and the effects of sanctions on African nations dependent on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for trade and transport links. Other members of the committee are <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Redevelopment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officials </ORGANIZATION> urged President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday to support a tax increase as a way to correct what it said is a crisis in housing. `` It is now time to recognize the severity of the fiscal deficit and its pervasive impact on all aspects of the quality of life in our communities,'' said <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sause </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, president of the association. `` The only way to address it is to increase revenues,'' she said at a news conference. `` Unless this action is taken, no one will seriously address the need to adequately fund domestic programs.'' The association, which is holding its annual winter meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, represents more than 2,700 local housing and community development agencies across the country. She cited a 70 percent reduction in federal funding for housing since 1980, the loss of the $ 4 billion general revenue sharing program to local governments, and the loss of tax incentives for building low-income housing as a result of the 1986 tax law changes, as `` devastating'' the supply of housing. She said the increasing numbers of homeless families and households living in substandard housing are evidence of a crisis in housing. In calling for higher taxes, the association declined to suggest a specific proposal for raising taxes or to say how much money should be raised through higher taxes.

The request was submitted by an Israeli diplomat to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Near </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, which handles the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, said the sources who spoke only on condition of anonymity. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> accused the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> of violating its December pledge to renounce all acts of terrorism. In a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Major </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> cited a clash Saturday in which Israeli troops killed five Palestinians on the northern border of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-proclaimed security zone in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> The radical <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> factions of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> and the Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> took responsibility for trying to attack <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> positions. Last December, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> overturned a 13-year ban on talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> after the organization's chief, <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, promised to stop all acts of terrorism and declared that his organization recognizes <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON>. met with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials Dec. 14 and twice more since then, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. Department spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, said `` we're looking into'' whether Saturday's attack violates <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s non-violence pledge. Other officials said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was seeking additional information about the clash. The complaint came as <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s military chief of staff, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON>, began a visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as the guest of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> has been quoted as telling the Israeli government in closed-door session that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has kept its promise and refrained from attacking Israelis in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> or along the border. But other officials contend that while <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> group may be adhering to the non-violence pledge, other, more militant factions within the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> are escaping <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s control. <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> is scheduled to meet with <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials and to tour <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> installations.

<HEAD>Black Leaders Say Miami Divisions Stall Progress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lack of unity in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s black leadership must be overcome before real progress can be made in the <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> neighborhoods that erupted into violence last month, community leaders say. `` Black leadership in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> is a myth,'' said <PERSON> Garth </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON>, 69, publisher of the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, a newspaper that serves the black community. `` We do n't have any organized leadership. A lot of people have their own agendas, but it's fractured.'' As a result, he said, `` we're powerless.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Due </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said he does n't know what people are talking about when they refer to the `` black community.'' `` I call it the non-community,'' he said. But unlike <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON>, Due said he thinks he knows why there is a leadership vacuum. `` We're all migrants,'' he said. `` We're all from somewhere else. We have no shared childhoods to develop trust and loyalty and extended families.'' He noted that after the 1980 and 1982 riots, white leaders called in prominent national black leaders such as <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to help deal with the situation. But he said blacks must now organize at all levels. `` We've got to have the street leaders there too,'' he said. `` You know, the king of the pool hall.'' The fractured nature of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s black leadership was evident a week after the riots, when Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, D-Mich., came to <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> to hear from local residents <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, the sponsor of the event, wanted to bar the media from the meeting. But City Commissioner <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON> and some other black leaders were opposed and threatened to walk out if the media ban were enacted. After some heated discussion, then reporters and cameras were allowed to stay. Just an hour earlier, a new black organization, <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, held its own event _ a `` rally for justice'' at the <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> building. Only about a dozen participants showed up but organizer <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardeman </PERSON> shrugged it off. `` That's not important,'' he said. `` It's the message, not the numbers, that are important. Eventually, the numbers will come.'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Overtown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, a long-standing committee of <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> leaders, agreed that <PERSON> black </PERSON> leadership is `` unfocused'' and said it amounts to a real problem. Yet he said he resents the new faces that have emerged since the recent riots. `` It's annoying. There are a lot of egos and prima donnas,'' <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said. The Rev. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, pastor of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baptist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said he welcomes new blood `` as long as it is not from out of town.'' <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> was especially critical of the visit by a controversial <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> black activist, the Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>, during the week of the riots. `` We do n't need any publicity seekers,'' he said. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> suggested that <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s black leadership problem may stem from the fact that the city's black communities are so spread out geographically. `` It would be impossible for any one individual to lay claim to the entire black community,'' he said. But not all prominent <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> blacks will admit that there is a leadership problem. `` We've got black leaders who are doing it every day, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>, -LRB- <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Commissioner -RRB- <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>, the Urban League,'' said <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fair </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION>. `` We were all here before the riots and we'll all be here after the riots. We'll ignore the Johnny-come-latelys.''

<HEAD>More Susceptible Land Coming Under Erosion Controls</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Conservation planning to protect highly erodible land from erosion has edged close to the two-thirds mark, give or take a few percentage points, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. As of Jan. 1, according to the department's <ORGANIZATION> Soil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, plans were completed for 89.2 million acres, or slightly less than 63 percent of the estimated 141.7 million acres. <ORGANIZATION> SCS </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Scaling </PERSON> said in his agency's statement, however, `` We met our goal of having conservation plans on 65 percent of highly erodible land by Jan. 1.'' Asked about the discrepancy between Scaling's claim and the Jan. 1 figures provided by the agency, officials said the 141.7 million acres were an estimate that is expected to be adjusted to about 136 million acres at some point. Thus, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, the goal for having 65 percent of the plans done by Jan. 1 had been met. To remain eligible for <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> programs, including crop price supports and other benefits, farmers who operate highly erodible cropland must have a conservation plan approved by Dec. 31, 1989. As of Jan. 1, conservation plans have been implemented on 25.2 million acres, or 18 percent of the land.

 People gazed through iron fences at a former palace on Monday, some with rosaries in their hands, hoping for signs that the government and opposition leaders inside were reaching agreement on the nation's future. `` People are standing around with tears in their eyes because they know the fate of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is being decided,'' a middle-aged woman said. `` We are all experiencing it. We are praying.'' Hundreds were outside when the 57 delegates of the government, Roman Catholic church and political opposition arrived at midday for negotiations that could bring political and economic reforms and restore legal status to the independent trade union Solidarity. A few people lingered in the darkening chill of late afternoon, staring at the glow of light from the two-story meeting hall in the 17th century palace, which once belonged to the <PERSON> Radziwill </PERSON> family. An occasional worker stopped briefly on the way home. There were some journalists, policemen, teen-agers muffling giggles. `` It is a positive event In the history of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> ... that both sides are beginning to be aware of the consequences ... if they do n't come to an agreement,'' said <PERSON> Piotr </PERSON> <PERSON> Rolkiewicz </PERSON>, a 56-year-old scientist. <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Paluszewska </PERSON>, an electronics engineer, added: `` This is really the last chance to save <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> from bloodshed.'' After the first day, conferees said talks would resume Wednesday with working groups addressing economic, social, labor and political problems that led the communist authorities to propose the negotiations. State television showed ranking government officials shaking hands with such opposition leaders as <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, the shipyard electrician who founded Solidarity in 1980 and won the Nobel Peace Prize three years later. `` I think <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> is the man who enjoys authentic authority among people and his talks will finally give some positive results,'' <PERSON> Rolkiewicz </PERSON> said. `` Society is waiting. The point is not to take revenge, but to repair this People's Republic of ours.''

<HEAD>Fruit Farmer Suggests Making Home For Retarded Man</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A fruit farmer has offered to take in a retarded man who has spent 32 years in a state mental hospital after being mistakenly ruled insane, a judge said Monday. The judge had planned to announce the fate of the man, <PERSON> Bernt </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, 51, at a hearing Monday, but put off his decision to consider the new offer. The <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ordered <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> freed, ruling he was wrongly judged insane in 1957 after first confessing to a murder and then recanting. A committee appointed by Third District Judge <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> already had made recommendations on <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s future. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> said he wants the committe to study the new offer, and he will decide Feb. 22 where <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> should live. The farmer, <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayman </PERSON>, 61, a retired school teacher, said he has employed five mentally retarded men over the past 24 years, one of which remains at the farm, living in a mobile home. `` I was looking around for someone to keep this boy company,'' <PERSON> Wayman </PERSON> said, referring to the handicapped man who lives and works on his farm. He said he did not consider <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> dangerous. `` I gather from what I've read and what I've been told that it's past history The incident was one that was not intentional,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled last June that <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> should be freed from the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Provo </LOCATION>, where he was sent following the 1957 rape and beating of a 5-year-old girl. During questioning about that crime, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, then 19, admitted to the 1955 murder of a 23-year-old mentally retarded woman he had known at the <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> for the mentally retarded in American Fork. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> later denied killing the woman. He was found incompetent to stand trial and the murder was never solved. His attorney, <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, has said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> has the mental capacity of an 8-year-old and should fare well in a group home with other retarded adults. But state officials have said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> still is capable of violent behavior. `` He has not been a model client,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lesnan </PERSON>, program specialist in the state Division of Mental Health. `` It has been an ongoing series of events, not sporadic, that have convinced us he could be dangerous. `` His episodes have ranged from minor, like making threats, to very serious, like physical aggression that requires several people to restrain him,'' <PERSON> Lesnan </PERSON> said. When questioned after the hearing Monday about whether he wanted to leave the <LOCATION> Provo </LOCATION> institution, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> replied, `` Yes, I do, real bad. I've got friends inside and outside. `` Right now I'm starting to hate it more worser,'' he said, adding he would be happy living on a ranch because he grew up ranching and farming. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkerhoff </PERSON>, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s treatment coordinator at the mental hospital, said that if conditions were right at <PERSON> Wayman </PERSON>'s ranch perhaps that would be the best choice. Social Services officials have said there are three other choices. They include placing <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> in a house or apartment under 24-hour supervision; a small group home with other retarded adults, and a semi-independent apartment setting with staff members housed on either side of those living quarters.

 However, the balance would be paid from on-budget outlays of general revenues. Hopefully, some of these revenues will be recovered in the future through sale of assets and recovery of funds from the wrongdoers. Fourth, we plan to increase the budget of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> by approximately $ 50 million to enable it to create a nationwide program to seek out and punish those that have committed wrongdoing in the management of these failed institutions. These funds will result in almost doubling the personnel devoted to the apprehension and prosecution of individuals committing fraud in our financial markets. As you can see, these proposals are based upon several overriding principles. First, I will not support any new fee on depositors. Second, we should preserve the overall federal budget structure and not allow the misdeeds and the wrongdoings of savings and loan executives and the inadequacy of their regulation to significantly alter our overall budget priorities. And third, I have concluded that this proposal, if promptly enacted, will enable our system to prevent any repetition of this situation. And fourth, I've decided to attack this problem head-on, with every available resource of our government, because it is a national problem. I've directed that the combined resources of our federal agencies be brought together in a team effort to resolve the problem. And fifth, I believe that banks and thrifts should pay the real cost of providing the deposit insurance protection. The price the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> charges banks for their insurance has not been increased since 1935. We propose to increase the bank insurance premium by less than 7 cents per $ 100 of insurance protection that they receive. Every penny collected would be used to strengthen the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> so that the taxpayers will not be called on to rescue it a few years from now. And I make you a solemn pledge that we will make every effort to recover assets diverted from these institutions and to place behind bars those who have caused losses through criminal behavior. Let those who would take advantage of the public trust and put at risk the savings of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> families anticipate that we will seek them out, pursue them, and demand the most severe penalty. In closing, I want to just say a word to the small savers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Across this great land, families and individuals work and save, and we hope to encourage even greater rates of savings to promote a brighter future for our children. Your government has stood behind the safety of insured deposits before. It does today, and it will do so at all times in the future. Every insured deposit will be backed by the full faith and credit of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, which means it will be _ that it will be absolutely protected. For the future, we will seek to achieve a safe, sound and profitable banking system. However, integrity and prudence must share an equal position with competition in our financial markets. Clean markets are an absolute prerequisite to a free economy and to the public confidence that is its most important ingredient. I've determined to face this problem squarely and to ask for your support in putting it behind us. I have ordered that the resources of the executive branch be brought to bear on cleaning up this problem. I have personally met with the leadership of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on this issue. My administration will work cooperatively with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as the legislation that we will submit in a few days' time is considered. I call on the Congress to join me in a determined effort to resolve this threat to the American financial system permanently, and to do so without delay.

 Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who seized power in a violent coup last week, denied links with the drug traffic and announced Monday that elections will be held May 1, with only communists excluded. Four cronies of ousted President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, who ruled <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> for nearly 35 years until the coup, were accused of using public funds and graft to obtain `` luxurious mansions, expensive apartments abroad and sumptuous automobiles.'' Reporters asked the general about casualties during eight hours of fighting Thursday night and early Friday that ousted <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>. `` Believe me, total casualties _ dead plus wounded _ do not exceed 50,'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> replied. Earlier estimates by embassies and civilian witnesses put the number of dead alone at nearly 300, but no official figures have been released. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been dissolved and that the new president would take office immediately upon election. Some opposition leaders said they did n't have enough time to prepare for the election. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> was given asylum in neighboring <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and was staying in <LOCATION> Itumbiara </LOCATION>, a remote city 270 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>. He is living in a house owned by the government power company, which operates a dam on the nearby <LOCATION> Paranaiba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. At the first presidential news conference Paraguayans could remember, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said rumors of his involvement with the drug trade `` were spread by people trying to defame me. `` I detest drugs,'' he told reporters let into his office in small groups. `` I swear as a Catholic and as a family man; I swear on my children, I have no connections with drugs.'' <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> has become a way station for cocaine produced in neighboring <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. Foreign diplomats, academics and media reports have linked <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> with traffickers, but no proof has been presented and no charges have been filed. Asked whether he would cooperate with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, he said <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> `` will cooperate with all foreign governments and agencies, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and the more help we get the better. We will fight together.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> will depend on the actions of the government on creating democracy, respecting human rights and suppressing narcotics trafficking and cultivation. `` We will be watching closely the extent to which the provisional government allows opposition parties to campaign and the media to broadcast the positions of the candidates and their parties,'' he said. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, a 65-year-old cavalry general, said <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> `` was not a dictator.'' `` If the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> elected him for so many years, it must have been because of confidence in him,'' he said. After seizing power in 1954, <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> held elections every five years and won by landslides. `` <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s legal situation is being studied by the court system,'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> added. `` He could come back in two or three years. He has gone for a rest in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>.'' Asked what prompted the coup, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said: `` In recent times he was not producing good results for his party, which had trusted him.'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> did not explain the remark, but he appeared to be speaking of an internal struggle between <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> supporters and `` traditionalists'' who wanted to draw a distinction between the 101-year-old party and the dictator. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> also said several <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> henchmen `` are under arrest and their cases will be brought before civil or military courts.'' A lawyer, <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Abilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rolon </PERSON>, filed a citizen's suit in <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday against the former ministers of the interior, justice and public health and <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s private secretary, <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdo </PERSON> <PERSON> Benitez </PERSON>. He accused them of misusing public funds and accepting bribes. Thirty-five former government and <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials were arrested after the coup. The ruling <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said it would hold a convention soon to choose new leaders and candidates for the general elections. The setting of an election date so quickly caught opposition leaders off guard. Several said they did n't think they could organize in time, and early elections gave a tremendous edge to the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` This date was arrived at without consultation,'' said <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Laino </PERSON>, leader of what is thought to be <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s biggest opposition group, the <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` I personally ca n't even be a candidate for anything because I'm not registered `` In the past, we've called for electoral abstention,'' he said. `` Our people are not registered on the voter lists. It seems to us that this -LRB- early election -RRB- could be interpreted as a trap.'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said all parties `` except those that are communist'' would be allowed to enter candidates. `` Our constitution does n't consider the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to be democratic,'' he said Several <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders have indicated its candidate for president might be <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Argana </PERSON>, the foreign minister in the provisional government <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> appointed. When asked whether he might be a candidate himself, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> smiled and said: `` The <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, not I, selects the candidate. I am simply a soldier, not a politician. However, if I can be useful to my country, I will do what I am asked.''

 Discovery's astronauts ran through emergency drills at the launch pad Monday, and their commander said he was confident engine pump problems would be resolved in time for a mid-March launch. Pad safety personnel briefed Commander <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON> and his four crewmates on escape routes and other procedures in case there is a fire or other problem on the pad during the countdown. Included was a demonstration of a basket filled with ballast zipping down a 1,200-foot `` slide for life'' wire that runs from the spacecraft cabin level 195 feet above the ground. This is the quickest escape measure, and, at the bottom, the astronauts have a choice of entering a concrete underground bunker or driving away in a tank-like vehicle. At the base of the launch pad, technicians were removing the turbopumps from Discovery's three main engines. They will be replaced by three new pumps because of two tiny cracks discovered in a pump bearing shaft following the December flight of the shuttle Atlantis. The decision to replace Discovery's pumps has delayed the launch from Feb. 23 until March 10 at the earliest. Officials said last week that if Discovery does not get off the only available shuttle launch pad by March 18, the mission might have to be delayed until later in the year. That's because the following shuttle mission, that of <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION>, has only a 30-day period starting April 28 during which its crew can dispatch the <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> spacecraft to probe the planet <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> wants to preserve that entire launch window if possible, because <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> will not come into position as a target again until 1991. Coats told reporters after Monday's escape drills that he is confident about a mid-March launch. `` We were discouraged about a week ago, because the first analysis indicated it might take too long a time to get the new pumps and that there would be no way we could launch in March,'' he said. `` Now everybody we've talked is very optimistic. We're confident they've got a good fix on it now. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldrich </PERSON>, the ageny's national space transportation system director, said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Monday he is confident of launching Discovery without affecting the Atlantis launch. `` We believe this work has proceeded well since we started to build up the new pumps and, barring any hiccup, we believe we can well support an adequate launch window to launch STS-29 -LRB- Discovery -RRB- and still give full coverage to the window for <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Aldrich </PERSON> said if Discovery is close to launching but ca n't make it by March 18, officials would consider launching Atlantis later in its window. He said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> is aiming currently to launch Discovery by March 14, and that a firm date will be set March 3 following a two-day launch readiness review. On Tuesday, astronaut Coats and his crew will don their bulky spacesuits and climb aboard Discovery for the final two hours of a countdown rehearsal.

 After five days of interviewing prospective jurors, the judge in <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s Iran-Contra trial said Monday that he expects the selection process to end Tuesday with a jury being impaneled. `` I expect to be able to put a jury into the box tomorrow,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> after declaring six more people to be qualified to sit on the jury. The number deemed qualified by <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> stood at 29 women and 9 men _ all black, except for one white woman. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> also ordered that the jury will not be sequestered _ kept apart from family and normal life to avoid contact with news reports about the trial, expected to last up to five months. The minimum needed for the panel was 40, under this arithmetic: There will be 12 jurors and six alternates. The defense will be able to reject 10 members of the panel without stating a cause; the prosecutors 6. In addition, each side can have three alternates excused. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> is aiming for a pool of more than 40, a number that allows for any last-minute dropouts for reasons of illness or financial hardship. The normal challenges to jurors for `` cause'' have been taken care of in the course of individual questioning that began last Tuesday. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said originally he wanted the panel to have 50 members, but he reduced that number to 45 last week and said at the end of the court day Monday he wanted at least 44. More prospective jurors will be questioned Tuesday from a pool of 40 to be brought in. <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers had asked that the jurors be sequestered. In his written order, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> did not state a reason for turning them down, saying only that `` the court does not presently intend to sequester the jury.'' North is accused of 12 crimes carrying a maximum of 60 years in prison. After the court day, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> held a closed-door session to hear independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said only that it was `` concerning his classified document problems.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> strongly objected last month to Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> about classified information to be presented in the case and said it warranted blocking the trial. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> rejected the <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION>'s suggestion. Only those prospective jurors who say they heard, read or saw none of North's extensive televised Iran-Contra testimony before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 are being admitted into the jury pool. So far <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s defense has voted against nearly all those chosen on one ground or other. `` I understand your position _ everybody is disqualified,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> on Monday. Under the rules of the court, the defense later will be allowed to remove 10 people from the pool and the prosecution 6 without stating a reason. Each side also gets three each of such peremptory challenges when it comes to choosing the alternates. The jury will be composed of 12 jurors and 6 alternates. One woman accepted for the jury pool is an office clerk who said she recalled seeing a July 1987 magazine with <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s picture on the cover, but did n't recognize <PERSON> North </PERSON> in the courtroom and when asked whether she had heard of him said, `` No, I never have.'' Five prospective jurors were excused in rapid order Monday morning, one because her boyfriend was on the grand jury that indicted North. Another who was excused told the judge that what she can recall from the hearings is only vague. She said she had the television on `` but I was listening and not listening.'' Her dismissal came when she said she head heard on television that there had been shredding of documents and lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON> include lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 and 1986 about his efforts on behalf of the Nicaraguan Contras and lying to the attorney general about the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s role in diverting money from the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sales to the Contras.

 <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the wife of Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, is being treated for alcohol problems triggered by her husband's loss to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the 1988 presidential election, the governor said Monday Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was not known to be dependent on alcohol until the governor's statement, but she has had a history of addiction to diet pills. She entered a <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> treatment center in 1982, where she said she conquered her dependency. `` Until shortly after Election Day on Nov. 8, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> had never had a problem with alcohol,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in a statement. He said that since the presidential campaign Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 52, used alcohol `` in excessive quantities ... on a limited number of occasions while at home.'' `` As she has now discovered, whether it comes in a bottle or is solid, if you are chemically dependent, you are chemically dependent,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said at a news conference. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who does not smoke and rarely drinks even a glass of wine, said his wife had entered the <LOCATION> Edgehill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> facility in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, on Sunday and will stay there about a month. `` She recognizes it. It was her decision to go into treatment,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, adding that he and their children supported her choice. `` It is a disease from which you never recover; you're always recovering,'' he said, calling her alcohol problem another manifestation of her underlying chemical dependency. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in July 1987, early in her husband's presidential campaign, that she had recovered five years earlier from a 26-year addiction to mild amphetamines she began taking as a teen-ager to control her weight She won praise for her candor and became an active campaigner, often appearing as a surrogate for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The couple was at home in suburban <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION> during the weekend, and there was no specific incident or accident that prompted the decision to seek treatment, according to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' problem was caused by `` a combination of physical exhaustion, the stress of the campaign effort and the post-election letdown,'' the governor said. `` We know how loved and respected she is both here in the commonwealth and across the nation _ and she is grateful for the love and support she has received from so many good and decent people,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> said the problem _ which he refused to characterize as alcoholism _ flared up in the three months since the election and did not involve a renewed use of drugs other than alcohol. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been prominent in the fight to educate youngsters against the perils of drug and alcohol abuse. Since the presidential defeat, Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has launched a career as an author and lecturer and has not appeared at her husband's side on several occasions when she might have been expected. On Jan. 3, for example, when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made the surprise announcement that he would not seek a fourth term as governor, some observers remarked on the fact that Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was not present. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> left open the possibility that he would run for the White House again in 1992. In 1983, Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> took the lead in the state's `` Great American Smokeout'' and announced that she was quitting cigarettes after smoking since age 14. But she quickly became a chronic quitter. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said that when his wife gets out of <PERSON> Edgehill </PERSON>, `` I expect that she will resume a very active and busy schedule.''

 The government's top delegate to historic talks with the opposition opened the first session Monday by offering to legalize Solidarity if the union agrees to economic and political reforms. Interior Minister Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, seated opposite Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, called for the opposition to participate in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s government. Fifty-seven delegates from the government, the opposition and the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> gathered for the talks at the ornate Council of Ministers Palace, the building where the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact was created. The delegates met for about three hours and issued a short communique that said talks by three `` working groups'' would resume Wednesday. One group will consider economic and social policies, another political reforms and the third the issue of allowing more than one union to exist. `` We were brought together here by the sense of responsibility for the future of our motherland. We are all responsible for the <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to be,'' <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> told the participants, the state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` We must accept the philosophy of necessity alongside that of the gradual character of transformations,'' he said. `` As it goes for trade union pluralism, there is no question if, but the point is how.'' `` We demand Solidarity. We have the right to it,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said in his speech, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> blamed <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economic and political crisis on a lack of freedoms, but said he sensed the government was ready for change, state-run TV reported. `` We know the country is in ruins. But it has not been ruined by gnomes, but by the system of carrying out power which has been depriving people of their rights and wasting the fruits of their labor,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. `` The time of social and political monopoly is ending. We need a restructuring that will turn the one-party state into a state of the nation and the society,'' he said. Known as the round table, the talks are the first between Solidarity and the government since the union was suppressed by the martial-law crackdown in December 1981. `` If we work out at the round table ... a confirmed consensus on the idea of non-confrontational elections as well as support for planned political and economic reforms, there will be an immediate possibility'' to allow more than one trade union to exist at a given factory, <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> called for changes in electoral laws and a new parliament that would `` represent a coalition of forces.'' Solidarity has expressed willingness to see the opposition enter parliament. But it is reluctant to endorse opposition participation in a Cabinet that, despite reform, is likely to be dominated by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, a member of the ruling Politburo, said if Solidarity were legalized, it `` can not return to old ruts, becoming the source of anarchy and tensions.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> `` accepted all of <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>'s suggestions in the name of the side he represents,'' Polish TV reported. `` We are saying words, but <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> needs facts, new, brave actions. ... All Poles will take account of our every word and every decision and also, and maybe first of all, our lack of decisions,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` The biggest problem we have to fight now is the catastrophe of the Polish economy,'' he said. Both sides agree that compromise is essential if <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is to overcome its huge $ 38.9 billion debt and chronic consumer shortages. The talks were given heavy TV coverage throughout the night and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Trybuna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ludu </ORGANIZATION> came out with an extra evening edition. Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> told reporters that authorities were satisfied with the session. The speeches `` showed a rather convergent way of thinking about the future and about the changes necessary in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' Urban said. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> proposed the talks in August 1988 during the country's worst wave of strikes in seven years, but <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> refused to commit Solidarity until the authorities agreed to legalize the union In a dramatic reversal of its seven-year stand against Solidarity, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Jan. 18 approved such a plan. Four days later, the union said it was willing to talk. The participants represent the major political and social forces in the country and include the official trade union OPZZ, the Peasants' Party and the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. Hundreds of cheering Solidarity supporters waved at the union delegation outside the palace. Polish TV carried a live broadcast of the delegates taking their seats. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> led the Solidarity delegation into the palace, and grinned after he took his seat at the pine table specially built for the talks. Opposition activists expect the talks to continue for about six weeks.

 I welcome the leaders that are with me here on this platform. I think their support says a lot about the efficacy of our proposal. And now I propose to take just a few questions. On the technical aspects, I will defer to these people and then I'll be glad to turn this over to Secretary <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. I believe we start with <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> and then <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> and then get going. Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, are you guaranteeing that the extra costs, premium increases and so forth, will not be passed on to the depositors, taxpayers? And also, what is your responsibility in this debacle? I mean the Reagan-Bush deal for deregulation of business and banking? A. On the first place, we're not guaranteeing that. I would hope that would n't happen, but there's no guarantee what the institutions will do. Secondly, there's enough to be said for everybody in this together trying to solve this problem. So I ca n't equate any personal _ I'm not inclined to go into any personal blame, simply to say that we've got to solve this problem and we're on the path to doing that. Yeah, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>. Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> votes tomorrow on that controversial pay raise plan. And the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has already voted against it. Would you sign a bill that vetoes the pay raise, not only for the members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but also for federal judges and other high officials in the government? A. I said I support it. Yes? Q. Mr. President, there is a feeling that part of this problem is attributable to deregulation of the financial industry. In retrospect, do you think that deregulation might have gone too far in the last 10 years or so? And, in the future, is your marching order to your administration to be a little more careful in regulating this particular industry? <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>, I do n't know the answer. I'd be most interested to know what our experts here feel about whether _ how much of the problem could be attributed to deregulation. I just do n't know the answer to your question. So, I ca n't reply. Yes? Q. Mr. President, you have placed considerable stress in these early days of your presidency on ethics and propriety, yet in recent days there's this controversy on Capitol Hill concerning the propriety of Senator Tower's alleged behavior, and questions raised over the weekend about the financial arrangements on the private funds of the man in charge of ethis, your counsel <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, and other questions involving members of the administration, or members-to-be of the administration. And I wonder sir, what's happened here Is it too harsh behavior on our part, too lax behavior on your part? What? A. I do n't think anything has happened. I learned long ago in public life not to make judgments based on allegations. But having said that, I want to have my administration aspire to the highest possible ethical standards. And we have appointed a commission to go out there now and try to detail what these standards should be. And we are in a new era on these matters; matters that might have been approved and looked at one way may have a different perception today. And, so, what I want to do is finalize our standards and then urge everybody in all branches of government to aspire to those standards.

<HEAD>Company Official Says 100 Companies Involved In Libyan Chemical Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The head of a state-owned company linked to construction of an alleged chemical weapons plant in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> was quoted as saying Monday that scores of Western companies unwittingly helped build it. But the official, <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Pieper </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Salzgitter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> concern, did not name any of the companies, <ORGANIZATION> Der </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spiegel </ORGANIZATION> newsmagazine reported. `` According to our current information, in addition to us, about 100 German, European and American companies were involved in the Pharma 150, and in such a way that none appears to have had an overview of the entire project,'' <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Pieper </PERSON> as saying. Pharma 150 was the code name used for the factory in <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say is a chemical weapons plant. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> says the plant makes pharmaceuticals. A <LOCATION> Salzgitter </LOCATION> subsidiary delivered switching equipment worth $ 540,000 to the <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION> plant, as well as blueprints and piping. <PERSON> Pieper </PERSON> was quoted as saying in the <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> interview that <LOCATION> Salzgitter </LOCATION> was duped into delivering the equipment by <ORGANIZATION> Imhausen-Chemie </ORGANIZATION>, a West German company based in <LOCATION> Lahr </LOCATION>. Imhausen-Chemie is the target of a criminal probe into its dealings with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pieper </PERSON> was quoted as saying his company believed the equipment was going to a plant in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> that Imhausen-Chemie allegedly set up to conceal its dealings with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. The equipment never reached <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and is suspected of having been diverted to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. `` The disguise appears to have been so perfect that none of the many companies involved realized at the time who was behind the project and where the deliveries where going to,'' <PERSON> Pieper </PERSON> was quoted as saying. The <LOCATION> Salzgitter </LOCATION> president said in <LOCATION> Der </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Spiegel </LOCATION> he did not believe that Imhausen-Chemie knew how to build a chemical weapons plant. `` <LOCATION> Salzgitter </LOCATION> does not possess any know-how to build poison gas factories,'' he was quoted as saying. `` I am convinced that <ORGANIZATION> Imhausen </ORGANIZATION> is also not capable of doing so. A third party must have done that in <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Salzgitter </LOCATION> is based in a town in <LOCATION> Lower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Saxony </LOCATION> by the same name.

<HEAD>U.N. Says 500,000 in Sudan Need Food</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 More than 500,000 people will need emergency food relief in the southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> this year, but a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency is having trouble delivering shipments, officials said Monday. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> said it is facing `` tremendous logistical problems in moving desperately needed relief food to the southern provinces'' of the war-torn country due to bad roads and lack of proper equipment. The agency, the food aid arm of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, said its first overland shipment of food in more than four months recently arrived in the town of <LOCATION> Kaya </LOCATION> near the Ugandan border. It consisted of 220 tons of corn aboard 16 trucks. The agency suspended ground shipments late last year after 11 drivers were killed when Sudanese rebels attacked a truck convoy in September. The agency said it was organizing a second truck convoy to carry another 400 tons of corn to <PERSON> Kaya </PERSON>. In a statement issued in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, the agency said more than 150,000 refugees have flocked to camps in <LOCATION> Juba </LOCATION>, about 90 miles north of <LOCATION> Kaya </LOCATION>. It said they need 2,000 tons of food monthly, but that an even greater amount must be delivered and stockpiled before roads are made impassable by the start of the rainy season in late April or early May. `` If overland transport proves insufficient to fulfill needs, -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- may consider initiating a new airlift to <LOCATION> Juba </LOCATION>,'' the agency's statement said. The agency ended an airlift to the provincial capital in December after delivering 3,700 tons of food, but several other organizations, including the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, are continuing flights. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency said little or no food has been delivered to more than 200,000 refugees in <LOCATION> Bahr </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ghazal </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Upper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Provinces </ORGANIZATION>, both far north of the Ugandan and Kenyan borders.

 But I do think, <PERSON> Rick </PERSON>, that it's fair that we not reach judgment on <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearings before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearings are concluded, because it's very hard to filter out fact from fiction, spurious allegation from fact. And I am not about to make a judgment based on a sensationalized newspaper story. I'm simply not going to do that. That would n't be fair, and I'm not sure how ethical it would be. So let's wait and see. This _ you're referring to the Tower matter up there. That matter has been looked at by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. The committee now has that. They have the responsibility to make determination. And I'll be very interested to see what they say. But I am not going to make conclusions _ jump to conclusions based on stories that may or may not have any validity at all. Yes? Q. Mr. President, even if, as your spokesman says you do, you continue to back Senator Tower for the position, there are those, you've heard, who say that the best thing he could do for you is to step aside, because even if confirmed, he then would become `` damaged goods,'' weaker in administering, a very, very tough job on your behalf. How do you respond to that suggestion? A. Well, I think people would not want a person to step aside, given rumor, particularly if the rumor is baseless. And the process _ what _ the problem is the process is taking a little longer than I would like, and yet, I think the Senate has got to do what they're doing _ looking at these allegations very carefully. But, you know, as I said here at this same podium a while back, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are basically fair. And, if these allegations prove to be allegations without fact behind them, I think the people are going to say, `` Wait a minute. What went on here? How come it was all this _ we'd read this one day, and then kind of a puff of smoke the next?'' And, so, I do n't think, in your substantive question though, that if it proves _ if the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee gives its endorsement to the senator, particularly after all of these allegations, that there is any danger at all of damage to his credibility or his ability to do the job. Yes? Q. Mr. President, there are new and substantive allegations that Senator Tower lost control over the highly classified security documents and computer disks that were used in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> under his watch. If those allegations prove to be founded, would you then withdraw his nomination? A. I would not answer hypothetical questions of that nature. You're telling me something that I have n't heard before. And, we did have access to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> reports. So, if this matter is now before the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, let them investigate it. But, I ca n't go into a hypothesis. All I would be doing would be adding to, I think, speculation that is not helpful at this juncture. Q. But, sir, will you pursue these allegations in the executive branch? Are you going to track what the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is looking into? Are you going to personally surveil these kinds of allegations yourself? A. Every rumor and every innuendo? No. But, if you make _ if there's some substantive allegation of this nature, of course it would concern me. Yes? Q. Mr. President, back to S & amp; Ls, if we might. Millions _ -LRB- laughter -RRB- _ millions of Americans save alternatively. That is, they put their funds in mutual funds, stocks, and that kind of thing. As I read it, you've now outlined a plan that places a lot of the S & amp; L bailout on the backs of the general treasury. How fair is that? A. We've got a major problem and something has to be done. And this is the fairest system that the best minds in this administration can come up with. And, so, I'd _ I, again, would ask you to ask the specifics of the treasury burden to the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> or the secretary of the treasury. Ask how they see that.

 But, look, as I've said, there is no easy answer to this. All I want to do is make a sound proposal, work to put it into effect, and have that proposal such that the country wo n't have to face this problem again. Yes, <PERSON> Dave </PERSON>? Q. Mr. President, you said you dropped the deposit fee idea. But this plan you've given us has an increase in premimums that may be paid by consumers as well as a large amount of taxpayer's money. Is n't that the same thing _ consumers and taxpayers are still going to have to pay the price for this? A. Well, as I indicated earlier on, there is no guarantee of passing this on to the consumer, nor is there a guarantee it wo n't be passed on But this arrangement has been there since _ for 50 years. And you might argue whether it's been passed on or not, I just do n't know; I have n't seen the flow-through in the industry. But nothing is without pain when you come to solve a problem of this magnitude. Yes? Q. Mr. President, you've talked to several members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in various receptions and dinners and personal conversations over the past couple of weeks, in many of them you discussed your plan for this problem. What is your feeling for the reception that it's going to get on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and of the selling job that it will make you have to get it passed? A. We may have a big selling job. But I've been encouraged so far with the spirit epitomized by the members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, particularly at the joint leadership meeting the other day. We did n't go into every detail of this; these plans were still being formulated and I wanted to get their views. I was encouraged by what <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> told me earlier on about how he _ what he felt the receptivity of the plan will be. But I do n't think it's fair to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to say that they have signaled to me that they are going to be enthusiastic on this plan, although I hope they are. Yes? Q. Mr. President _ A. I'm going to take about three more, and then turn this over to these gentlemen here who are prepared to go into as much detail as you want. Yes? Q. Mr. President, on these allegations that surround Tower now, at least variations on the theme surfaced early in the transition _ allegations of womanizing and taking money from defense contractors, that sort of thing. Have you satisfied yourself that he is still the nominee you want? And can you give us, at this time, a wholehearted endorsement of Tower? A. Yes, I can, and I will right now, because some of the very same allegations that were floated that long ago apparently have been looked at and examined by the best possible examiners _ I'm talking about the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> _ and found to be groundless So, therefore, I'm not about to change my view. Now if somebody comes up with facts, I hope I'm not narrow-minded enough that I would n't take a look, but I am not going to deal in the kinds of rumors that I've seen reported and then knocked down, and then reported and then knocked down. Yes?

<HEAD>Experts Praise Mrs. Dukakis for Quick Treatment of Drinking Problem</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Alcoholism experts praised <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Monday for seeking treatment of alcohol abuse after a relatively brief bout of heavy drinking following her husband's loss of the presidential election. Doctors attributed the family's quick action, in part, to their awareness of addiction problems following Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s earlier struggle with a dependence on diet pills. `` For a public figure, who knows any revelation about problems is going to be widely publicized, it takes great courage to seek treatment,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Domenic </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciraulo </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` This is a family that certainly knows about substance abuse,'' he said. `` It's unusual to seek help so early, but it shows they know the signs of trouble so well.'' <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Monday that his wife had been admitted to a private hospital in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, R.I. He said she had never had a drinking problem until shortly after the Nov. 8 election, which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic nominee, lost to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Unfortunately, a combination of physical exhaustion, the stress of the campaign effort and the post-election letdown all combined to create a situation in which, on a limited number of occasions while at home, she has used alcohol in excessive quantities,'' the governor said. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was treated in 1982 for a 26-year reliance on amphetamine diet pills. Dr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Piscataway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said that if the drinking only began in November, there probably has not been time for Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to become physically dependent on alcohol. `` If what the governor says is accurate, they have been quite courageous in deciding to do something about this early,'' <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> said. `` The odds are far better that they will be able to get it under control, and there wo n't be any permanent consequences.'' Dr. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutker </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> said that seeking treatment for alcohol abuse does not necessarily mean someone is an alcoholic. `` You could go in because you do n't like the fact that you drank heavily on a few occasions,'' she said. `` You want to nip it in the bud. She might not be an alcoholic and wants to go in for some stress management.'' Several experts said that people who already have had one form of addiction are susceptible to developing another. `` Drug switching does occur, and the drug that's easiest to switch into is alcohol,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> of <LOCATION> McLean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Belmont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` It's easy to get, cheap, legal and the most socially acceptable.'' The experts discounted the once popular notion that some people have addictive personalities. Instead, they said that abusers of drugs and alcohol tend to have little in common except their addiction. <PERSON> Ciraulo </PERSON> said people may turn to a variety of mood-altering substances as a way of coping with their problems. `` As a way to deal with stress and pain, alcohol or any other drug is an effective way on a temporary basis to relieve it,'' he said. Some people may also `` experience depression or psychological pain more intensively than others and then use drugs or alcohol as a way to treat their own pain.''

 Q. Mr. President, there have been hints that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> may propose a test to defuse the situation in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. I wonder if you see the possibility of superpower deals in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and, if so, what you _ if you could suggest what would be acceptable to you? A. I do n't know about a deal, but I can see a possibility of cooperation in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, because I would like the Soviets to understand that we have very special interests in this hemisphere, particularly in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and that our commitment to democracy and to freedom and free elections and these principles is unshakable. And I do n't think they really have substantive interests in this part of the world, certainly none that rival ours. So, I would like to think they would understand that. And there are so many areas where we could demonstrate a new spirit of cooperation, and this would clearly be one of them. So, I'd like to think that is the way that the matter would be approached by the Soviets. Yeah, a follow-up. Q. Could I follow up and ask you whether an understanding on <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, whether you'd be willing to include abandonment of aid to the Contras as part of such an understanding? A. I would n't make a deal on that with the Soviets, nor would that come up. I do n't believe you'd ever have a _ I ca n't see a situation of that nature arising, knowing, as I do, what will be negotiated and discussed with the _ so I think that's a _ so hypothetical as to not even be a possibility of any kind. Yeah, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, and then I do have to run. Q. Mr. President, we still do n't know what the taxpayer's burden is in here out of this $ 40 billion and cents, first from S & amp; L funds and the shortfall from treasury funds. How big is it, and have you, in going through your budget, had to knock out some things to pay for this? A. We've had to knock out a lot of things on the overall budget for a lot of different reasons, but I'd like to leave this to <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> for the questioning, to give the specific amounts. It is shared, as I've indicated, and he can give you the amounts that are involved.

<TEXT>
 The speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, caved in Monday to opponents of a 51 percent congressional pay raise, conceding `` the majority has spoken'' in demanding a vote that will likely keep senators and representatives from getting any increase. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> set the vote for Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was expected to quickly give its assent and sent legislation halting the raise, due to take effect at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday, to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Senate Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said he expects <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to sign it. The vote, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, will be on `` a simple resolution of disapproval'' of the raises, which would also affect federal judges and top executive branch officials. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had planned to let the raise take effect Wednesday, then have the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote the next day to scale it back to 30 percent. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would have seen their annual salaries jump, at least temporarily, from $ 89,500 to $ 135,000. The speaker relented after opponents won a dramatic vote to keep the issue alive on the House floor. He said the chamber will vote Tuesday and promised, `` The majority will rule.'' The resolution would then go to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which voted 95-5 Thursday for a differently worded rejection measure. That chamber's majority leader, Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said he `` hopes and expects to bring up whatever the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> sends over'' and send it to the president before the raise becomes law, according to <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> aides. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, at a late afternoon news conference, was asked, `` Would you sign a bill that vetoes the pay raise, not only for the members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but also for federal judges and other high officials in the government?'' He answered, in an apparent reference to the pay raise, `` I said I would support it.'' But <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s Republican counterpart, Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., told reporters: `` I understand he'll sign it He needs to do it by midnight so the judiciary does n't get a big step while everybody else is being stepped on.'' The Constitution forbids raises for judges from being reduced once they take effect. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s turnaround came after pay raise opponents mustered a 238-88 majority against a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leadership motion to adjourn. `` The majority has spoken, and the majority will speak emphatically,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said afterwords. One leading opponent of the raise, consumer advocate <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s capitulation showed he had realized `` that the power of the people is greater than the power of his tyranny in -LRB- trying to -RRB- close down the House of Representatives until the members got their salary increase.'' The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Caucus, Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, D-Pa., predicted there would be `` no pay raise, no change'' in the lawmakers' salary <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> also said he doubted the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would move to ban speaking fees and other honoraria _ a plan favored by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> in return for the raise. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said members feared a vote to end Monday's debate and adjourn `` was going to be interpreted as a vote on the pay raise.'' He said any vote to increase lawmakers' salary now would fail. Even `` if it's a vote on 4 percent, it ai n't going to pass,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> added. `` This pay raise is dead,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, an architect of the opposition strategy. <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON>, however, said he expects <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to take up the issue later, along with a review of honoraria, often paid to members by special interests seeking to influence legislation. The vote and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s subsequent announcement came after Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., presiding over Monday's session, refused to recognize a pay-raise opponent who wanted to introduce a resolution calling for a vote on the hike That set the stage for more than 30 minutes of barbed debate between the two sides. From the start, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> electronic tote board showed the adjournment motion, by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., was losing <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> last week conducted a private survey of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members and said the results showed they did not want a vote before the raise took effect. Despite that, random surveys by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and other organizations showed sentiment in favor of a vote. A weekend Gallup poll indicated overwhelming public opposition to the pay raise. The Gallup organization asked 1,001 adults from Friday through Sunday whether they favored or opposed increasing congressional pay from $ 89,500 to $ 135,000. The results, with a 4 percent margin of error, showed 82 percent opposed it with only 15 percent in favor. Meanwhile, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, addressing the group's convention in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, urged members to call their congressmen to register their support for the pay raise for judges. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Raven </PERSON>, the association's president, then gave his listeners the phone number of the congressional switchboard. Besides the raise for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the presidential commission proposed: _ Increasing the president's pay from $ 200,000 to $ 350,000 and the vice president's from $ 115,000 to $ 175,000 The raises would not affect President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. _ Raising the salaries of top federal officials, now in the range of $ 75,500 to $ 99,500, to a range of $ 115,000 to $ 155,000 _ Hiking the salary of the chief justice from $ 115,000 to $ 175,000 and the salaries of associate justices of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> from $ 110,000 to $ 165,000 _ Raising the pay of federal appellate judges from $ 95,000 to $ 140,000 and that of federal district judges from $ 89,500 to $ 135,000 Retired congressmen, presidents, vice presidents, top federal officials and other federal judges would also receive higher pensions under the commission's proposal.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Monday there is a chance for `` a new spirit of cooperation'' between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in solving Central American problems. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked at a news conference if he foresees a deal with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to resolve the region's problems, which include a superpower dispute over leftist-ruled Sandinista. The Soviets help supply the Sandinista while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> provides aid to the anti-Nicaraguan Contra rebels. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would n't make a deal on Contra aid, but added, `` I can see a possibility of cooperation in Central America.'' The Soviets do n't have `` substantive interest in that part of the world, certainly none that rival ours. So I would like to think they would understand that,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` And there are so many areas where we could demonstrate a new spirit of cooperation and this would clearly be one of them.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has an `` unshakable'' commitment to democracy, freedom and free elections in the five-nation region, he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has n't spelled out his Central American policies, particularly the Contra aid question and the fighting in neighboring <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> between the U.S.-backed government and leftist rebels. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he is reviewing the policy of his predecessor <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, which involved unswerving support for military aid to the Contras. But officials have said no Contra aid will be sought in the near future and the administration is willing to support regional efforts toward a diplomatic solution to the Contra war. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Secretary of States <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> have n't yet named a new assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has settled on <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON>, a Democrat who helped the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration win Contra aid, but the appointment has n't been announced, said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity The previous holder of the post, <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, discussed <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> during several meetings with Soviet officials, but no substantive action ever came of the meetings. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has continually objected to the Soviet supply of weaponry to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government, saying the shipments continued through 1988, even after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms to the Contras were stopped. Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> visited the region last week and met with presidents of the four Central American democracies _ <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> refuses to meet with Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> on the grounds that he should conduct talks first with the Contras. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the administration supports the regional effort by the five presidents to reach a diplomatic solution. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sent a message last week to the Salvadoran military and the government, urging human rights improvements. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> deplored human rights violations from the leftist guerillas and the right wing factions, and indicated that unless <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> improves its record, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the country would likely be jeopardized.

Homeo boxes, which are portions of homeotic genes, `` have n't changed much since the fly'' and are found in mice and humans, in which they also help direct formation of the head, chest and abdomen, he added Thus, some basic and very ancient parts of genes that control anatomy are shared by flies, mice and humans, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gurdon </PERSON>, 55, a native of Dippenhall, <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, and a graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, has been at <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> since 1972. The professor of cell biology was cited for his work with frogs. He found that certain cells taken from the organs of a mature animal contain all the genetic information necessary to produce a frog, the foundation said. He showed such cells could be made to develop into tadpoles. The <ORGANIZATION> Wolf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> was set up in 1975 by <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, a German-born chemist who emigrated to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and later served as its ambassador to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

 Listen, thank you all very much. And now I'm going to turn this over to Secretary <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. And then I _ in order, I guess, they'll refer to each of these others. Huh? Q.

We did n't see you get back in this area. A. We did n't get that far back, no. But if there's been an egregious offense to those in the back benches, I will take one parting question, and inasmuch as you raised it, fire away. Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President. Back on the ethics issue, a couple of your prospective _ A. Mindful that the last question always does get you in great trouble. Go ahead. -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- Q. A couple of your prospective nominees _ one of your prospective nominees and your counsel have just recently changed their minds on matters that would have violated the ethics rules under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Did you have difficulty in getting the word out that times would be tougher under your administration? A. No, I do n't think so. For example, if you're referring to the <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> matter, which I think you are, that matter was reviewed every single year by the Office of Government Ethics. And he was deemed in compliance every single year. But now we've got a new ball game here. He's the general counsel here in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and I'm the president. And I've set out rhetorically the highest possible standards and we're trying to back that up by findings from this commission. And so, I do think that _ that we've got _ we've got to be very careful about perceptions of impropriety when it comes to conflict of interest, not rumors or innuendoes of one sort or another. I do n't think you can _ I should deal in those things. But when it comes to perceived conflicts of interest, I'd like our people to bend over backwards. And I think that's what has happened in both the question of <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, whether he's entitled to _ all he did was ask, `` Am I entitled to continue these arrangements with this small university?'' And all <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> did, in my view now, is to try to go a step beyond what the government ethics office has said to avoid the perception of impropriety. But _ so, I think it might be different now. I have to approach it differently as president, not that you have lower standards, but I just think that again, this whole question of perception, we've got to look at it very, very carefully. But I want to be fair. I do not want to have the loudest charge, no matter how irresponsible, be that that sets the standards. We've got to achieve more objective standards. And that's why I'm putting a lot of faith in the _ hope to put a lot of faith in the findings of Judge <PERSON> Wilkey </PERSON> and former Attorney General <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>. And they will be looking at all these matters in terms of reality, and then to some degree I'm sure, in terms of perception.

<TEXT>
 So, what might be legal and what might be perfectly sound ethically might have to be altered, given this new approach because of perception. It's a delicate one. I do n't want to have the standards set in such an irresponsible way that good people just throw up their hands and say, `` Look, who needs that kind of grief? Who needs it? Why should I have to give up all my whatever it is, my health plan from the XYZ Company?'' And yet, on the other hand, we're in a different time now; we're in a time when we've got to try to set these standards as high as possible So, I think Dr. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> did the right thing in asking what was proper. I think <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> did the correct thing every year in asking what was proper and reviewing his own personal holdings in a family company with the ethics office, but now, taking another step because of perception in this case. So, we've got to reach _ we've got to work with these individuals to find the proper answer, and we've got to work with the commission to try to codify these standards. Q. Sir, if I might follow up, you said during the campaign very clearly that your staffers would not take outside income. I wonder why they need a legal opinion to understand that. A. They had a legal opinion saying it was perfectly proper from this family company. And so, now we're changing that and saying, `` Look, there's this different perception problem here in this new era, so let's bend over as far backwards as we possibly can to recognize that.'' Thank you all very much. Q. What about leveraged buyouts, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>? A. There's your LBO man right there. -LRB- Referring to <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. -RRB- -LRB- Laughter. -RRB-

<UNK>Timman Wins Fifth Game Against Portisch, Ties Match</UNK>
<DATELINE>ANTWERP, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Timman </PERSON> of <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> fought back from a losing position with black on Monday to defeat <PERSON> Lajos </PERSON> <PERSON> Portisch </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in the fifth game in his World Chess Championship Candidates quarterfinal. With only one more game to go, <PERSON> Timman </PERSON>'s victory tied the match at 2.5-2 .5 <PERSON> Portisch </PERSON> won the third encounter in the six-game match last week, and the other three games played so far ended in draws. The 37-year-old Dutchman's performance in Monday's action was not the sort that will earn his win a place in chess theory books. Needing at least a draw to keep alive his chances against the 51-year-old Hungarian, <PERSON> Timman </PERSON> chose a somewhat unusual variation of the Modern Defense in an apparent effort to offset his opponent's opening advantage But <PERSON> Portisch </PERSON>, one of the world's greatest opening theoreticians, played as if he had seen it all before. With a series of strong, confident moves, he built up a vastly superior position, sacrificing an exchange to blast a trail for his center pawns on their advance to eventual promotion. `` My God'', was all <PERSON> Timman </PERSON>'s West German second, <PERSON> Vlastimil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hort </PERSON>, could say when he studied the position after the first twenty moves. Dutch grandmaster <PERSON> Genna </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosonko </PERSON> was more explicit. `` It's sad,'' he commented, `` but all black can do now is hope for white to make a mistake. It would not be the first time <PERSON> Portisch </PERSON> gets nervous when he seems to be winning.'' For 10 moves, however, the Hungarian did just fine, steadily working on his pawn advance and increasing the pressure on black's hedged-in troops But when the crucial moment came and one of his advanced pawns was on the verge of reaching the eighth rank, <PERSON> Portisch </PERSON> made a serious error, allowing <PERSON> Timman </PERSON> to return the exchange and even out completely. A few moves later, it was <PERSON> Timman </PERSON> who had the upper hand, and he made no mistakes. A black pawn, supported by queen and bishop, reached the second rank, and <PERSON> Portisch </PERSON> had to weaken his position in order to block it. <PERSON> Timman </PERSON> was at his best in this stage, exploiting white's weaknesses to the full and gradually gaining command of the whole board Portisch soldiered on for a while, but resigned at his 47th, when he stood to lose a piece. The Hungarian will be playing black in Wednesday's sixth game of the match, which will go into overtime with a two-game extension if neither player manages a win. In case the extension fails to produce a winner, a series of sudden-death rapid games at increasing speeds will have to decide the outcome of the contest. The winner of the Candidates series will challenge world champion <PERSON> Garri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> for his world title in 1990.

 <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s former king says he is willing to help form a new government and prevent a bloodbath after the Soviets complete their troop withdrawal, his spokesman said Monday. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> said urgent measures were necessary to promote national unity in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and prevent `` dissension, civil war and unnecessary bloodshed,'' in a message read to The Associated Press by his spokesman and brother-in-law, Gen. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wali </PERSON>. `` Now that the Afghan nation is about to achieve the aims of its heroic struggle, I wish to reiterate yet again that I am prepared to render, without any claim or precondition, any service to my country which would reflect the will of the majority of my compatriots,'' said <PERSON> Zaher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>, who has lived in exile in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> since being overthrown in 1973. Afghan rebel groups known as mujahedeen, or Islamic `` holy warriors,'' have been arguing over the process toward forming a transitional government to succeed the Soviet-backed regime. They have scheduled a meeting in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> on Friday that is intended to pave the way for elections among Afghan refugees for representatives that will form an all-Islamic government. The former king urged all sides to reject `` short-term political goals and personal gains'' and work together to rebuild the country in a political process free from `` pressure, intimidation, discrimination, privilege or foreign interference.'' Speculation about a possible role for the former king has been brewing for more than a year. In December, <PERSON> Zaher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> met in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> envoy who has been seeking to promote a peace settlement in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. While <PERSON> Zaher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> still has a following in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, some Moslem rebel groups oppose his return. Soviet troops entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979, fighting anti-Marxist Moslem guerrillas backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The Soviet withdrawal, which begin in May under a U.N.-mediated agreement, is to be completed by Feb. 15. <PERSON> Zaher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> lost his throne in July 1973 when his cousin and former prime minister, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Daud </PERSON>, seized power in a coup.

<HEAD>Committee Recommends Changes in Law to Permit Nazi Trials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Residents of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> who are suspected of being Nazi war criminals could be tried quickly if the government enacted simple changes in the law, a parliamentary committee said Monday. Nazi-hunters have accused <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> of delaying action on fugitive Nazis and their collaborators, including a Lithuanian-born man the <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wiesenthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> says was involved in killing thousands of Jews. The <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crimes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, with members from all parties, said <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> laws could be amended within six months to give courts jurisdiction over war crimes committed abroad by people who were not British citizens at the time. Parliament has amended laws to allow prosecution of hijackers, terrorists and others who committed `` sufficiently grave'' crimes abroad and later obtained citizenship, the committee said. `` The crimes under consideration, principally those of murder, manslaughter and genocide, were all criminal ` according to the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations' at the time of their commission,'' according to the 71-page report. It said <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> had enacted such laws since 1987 in order to prosecute war criminals. The government is expected to complete an investigation next month of allegations that <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> who committed war crimes in World War II are living in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Investigators also are considering whether the law can be amended to allow prosecution. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON>, secretary of the committee, said it fears the government will delay action for two or three years even though amending the statutes requires `` extremely minor legislation.'' The report said 250 people are being investigated for possible war crimes. Last summer, the <ORGANIZATION> Wiesenthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> gave the government a list of 13 alleged war criminals it said had come to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said it would try to trace the men, Russians now aged 63-89 whose names were first submitted by the Soviet ambassador in November 1947. The Wiesenthal center has identified 400 alleged war criminals in eight Western countries. The most publicized British case is of <PERSON> Antanas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gecas </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and now living in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, who acknowledges witnessing killings but denies involvement.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday stood by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, his embattled nominee to be secretary of defense, and said the former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator should n't have to withdraw because of rumors about his personal life. The confirmation process `` is taking a little longer than I would like, and yet I think the Senate has got to do what they're doing -- looking at these allegations very carefully,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added that if any rumors or innuendo turn out to be `` a substantive allegation of this nature, of course it would concern me.'' He said he still endorses Tower, but added, `` If somebody comes up with facts, I hope I'm not narrow-minded enough that I would n't take a look But I am not going to deal in the kinds of rumors that I've seen reported and then knocked down and then reported and then knocked down.'' Tower has subject of allegations that he is a womanizer and has a drinking problem. The administration said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigations into the matter had turned up nothing that would prevent Tower from carrying out his task as head of the Pentagon. But the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last week put off a Thursday vote on Tower's confirmation, saying two new allegations came up that had to be checked out. Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report was delivered Monday to the committee, the panel's chairman, Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., and ranking Republican, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., said they had n't seen any such <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said, `` We have not had anything delivered to us, and we are awaiting on it, so the status quo is right where it was.'' Asked about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s statement, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> elaborated that `` we've done some talking back and forth but we've received no report whatsoever.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> refused to speculate about the Tower rumors. `` If this matter is now before the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, let them investigate it. But I ca n't go into a hypothesis. All I would be doing would be adding to, I think, speculation that is not helpful at this juncture,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Senate Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Kan </LOCATION>., said at a news conference that Tower's confirmation chances had probably not been hurt by delay in a vote `` We should get the nomination out,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` If we investigated every rumor about every senator, we would n't have a quorum around this place. I checked as late as 4 p.m. and I have n't learned anything new The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> should wrap up its investigation by tomorrow morning.'' Asked about suggestions from some quarters Tower should withdraw, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I think people would not want a person to step aside, given rumor, particularly if the rumor is baseless.'' Tower participated in White House sessions on the defense budget, both on Saturday and again Monday, said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> formally asked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Monday to stop talking to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, and top leaders began a campaign to convince the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration that <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> broke a pledge to end terrorism. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> diplomat delivered the request to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Near </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, sources in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said on condition of anonymity. Israeli leaders cited the case of five Palestinian guerrillas killed Saturday night by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, near the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> border. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> submitted information `` identifying details and additional facts linking the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to that squad,'' <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said `` we're looking into'' whether the encounter Saturday violated <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s renunciation of terrorism. Other officials said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was seeking additional information. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> accused the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> of breaking a promise to refrain from terror and gave the firefight as evidence. In a speech to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> Jewish leaders, he said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was urging the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to reconsider its dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> on grounds the conditions for such contact had been `` clearly and unequivocally violated.'' Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said threats by <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> against Palestinians who might negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> were `` the worst terror ... more important even than an attempt to infiltrate from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' On the main shopping street of <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, police fired rubber bullets, tear gas and a water cannon to subdue dozens of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> stone throwers who smashed cars and shop windows. Arab witnesses said the demonstrators blocked the street with blazing tires and overturned garbage bins. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said two police officers suffered minor injuries. In the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, soldiers shot and wounded a 15-year-old Palestinian girl in the leg during clashes, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> doctors said. The army said it was checking the report. Also Monday, assailants set fire to the Israeli tax office in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Qalqiliya </LOCATION>, an army official said. The top floor of the two-story building was gutted, the official said. <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION>, a Moslem fundamentalist group, claimed responsibility for the attack in slogans sprayed on city walls. Tax boycotts are part of the Palestinians 14-month uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The revolt, which has taken the lives of 374 Palestinians and 15 Israelis, was largely responsible for the more moderate stance <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> stance that led the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to open a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials opened talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in December after <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> renounced terrorism and said he accepted <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials were shocked at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> move, which ended a 13-year boycott. The Jewish state considers the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> a terrorist group and refuses to talk with it. The army said the guerrillas slain Saturday were en route to carry out an attack against targets inside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The guerrillas had hand grenades, a pistol equipped with a silencer and wire cutters, army officials said. Three were identified as members of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction, and the other two as members of the radical <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. On Sunday, the groups issued a statement saying the target was within the Israeli security security zone in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. But on Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported they issued another statement that said the failed attack was `` an answer to the attempts by some Palestinian leaders to put an end to military struggle against Zionism.'' The statement reportedly said the two groups would not stop anti-Israeli attacks from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as instructed by <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, in a speech before the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Major </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions for a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> `` as they were set forth by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> have been clearly and unequivocally violated.'' `` I presume that in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> they also noticed what happened, but to the extent that somebody there may not have noticed, we will draw his attention to it,'' <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> group, said the Jewish leaders would pressure the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to end contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm not sure the administration is prepared to cut off the dialogue yet,'' <PERSON> Reich </PERSON> said. `` But we're going to press on them these issues.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, ruled that military officials can be forced to disclose secret evidence against Palestinians facing deportation, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> defense lawyer said. The ruling came on an appeal by <PERSON> Balal </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakshir </PERSON>, a Palestinian from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> who was ordered deported last year, said <PERSON> Leah </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzemel </PERSON>, one of his lawyers. In previous appeals, military prosecutors did not have to show the defendant evidence against him if the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the information was classified. <PERSON> Shakshir </PERSON>'s appeal is continuing. Since the uprising began, 49 Palestinians have been deported to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> from the occupied lands.

 The last military convoys rolled north toward the border Monday, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> officials said, more than a week before the deadline for the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> to leave a frustrating war in which it lost more than 13,000 men. A Soviet military spokesman said less than 20,000 Soviet soldiers remain in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and that they were moving toward the border on Monday. But in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, hundreds of Soviet soldiers still guarded the airport, where military transports brought in food and fuel to ease shortages caused by a blockade of the capital by Moslem guerrillas who surround it. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said `` the last Soviet soldier left <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'' on Sunday. Soviet officials in the Afghan capital, however, said about 1,000 <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troopers would remain at the airport until the end of next week. <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, the Soviet foreign minister, met with officials in neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> but did not find a way to end the 11-year-old civil war peacefully. He said Monday the Soviets would continue supporting the Marxist government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> but would not send troops back into the country. Soviet envoy <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> after talks with Afghan guerrillas leaders in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s neighbor on the west. He said he hoped `` all political forces'' would join a coalition government after the Soviets are gone, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official news agency reported, but the insurgents have consistently refused such proposals. Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in April 1978, and Soviet soldiers entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979, growing in numbers to an estimated 115,000 by the time the withdrawal began May 15 under a U.N.-mediated agreement. All are to be out of the country by Feb. 15. The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> says more than 13,000 Soviet soldiers were killed and 35,000 wounded in the nine years. Soviet diplomats said Monday all <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers in <LOCATION> Shindand </LOCATION> left their garrison, the last Soviet military complex in the country. They said the soldiers headed out of the western city over the weekend to meet a convoy at <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION> and were expected at the border Wednesday or Thursday. Pravda said Soviet troops had moved defensive checkpoints on the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> to about 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> at a tunnel through some of the roughest terrain of 260-mile withdrawal route. Pravda said insurgents did not attack Soviet convoys on the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION>, the only land route to the Soviet border from the capital, but four avalanches crashed down on retreating columns Sunday. It reported three soldiers killed and one injured. `` Terrorist grenades'' wounded three Soviet officers who were handing over vehicles to the Afghan army Sunday in a <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> suburb, the paper said. At <LOCATION> Termez </LOCATION>, a Soviet border city where an airborne regiment arrived Monday from <LOCATION> Afganistan </LOCATION>, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Korolev </PERSON> said the last <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers were moving toward the border. The military spokesman said a total of 20,000 troops were still in the provinces of <LOCATION> Balkh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Samangan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baglan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Parvan </LOCATION> _ between <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> border to the north _ and in the northwestern <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> province of <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION>. Thousands of residents, servicemen and relatives greeted the men of the 350th Parachute Regiment as they came across the Friendship Bridge over the <LOCATION> Amu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Termez </LOCATION>. The unit had been in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> since 1984. A brass band played. Soldiers waved flags and stuffed red carnations into the muzzles of their submachine guns. On the road behind the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> airport, by contrast, several young Soviets clutched their rifles nervously as they manned checkpoint bunkers. <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON>, a 20-year-old from <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION>, said he and the others would be flown home before Feb. 15 but had not been told exactly when. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official Soviet news agency, said guerrilla shelling killed eight people in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> province. It said one person was killed and two were wounded in the cities of <LOCATION> Gardiz </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paktia </LOCATION> province. Rockets and rocket-propelled grenades hit residential areas in <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION> and the airport at <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> in the south, the agency said. Guerrillas control nearly the Afghan countryside and, when the Soviets are gone, holding the cities will be left to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s conscript army The insurgents predict the Marxist regime of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, who uses only one name, will collapse quickly. A plane leaving <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on Monday took Charge d'Affaires <PERSON> Roymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Petit </PERSON>, the highest-ranking <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> diplomat, his wife and three Austrian diplomats to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. Also aboard were relatives of Yugoslav, East German and Vietnamese diplomats. The last remaining <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats left last week. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackley </PERSON>, who had been <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s senior diplomat in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, said in the Indian capital the simplest solution would be for <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> `` to be on the last plane out with the last Russian.''

 The White House asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Monday to reschedule confirmation hearings for <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> secretary-designate, in the wake of his decision to forfeit nearly $ 300,000 from his medical school presidency. No hearing date had been set by late Monday afternoon. The move by the administration signaled that the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is satisfied with <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s financial disclosure and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> background check, which had been cited earlier as reasons to postpone a previously scheduled hearing. The hearing was put back on track after <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> decided to forgo $ 297,000 in funds due him from his contract with the <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, which he founded and heads as president. In a White House statement issued last weekend, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said he had agreed to take an unpaid leave of absence to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest between the <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> job and <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION>, which receives about $ 5.8 million a year in federal funds. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> had originally asked the White House for permission to take a paid sabbatical from <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION>. After having worked at <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> for 13 years, he was entitled to a two-year leave at half pay _ about $ 200,000 total, according to a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The Office of Government Ethics at first glance approved the request, but later reversed itself because the school's sabbatical policy did not apply uniform standards to everyone at the school regardless of their situation, the source said. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, however, had another source of potential income from <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> that met with approval of the ethics office, the White House counsel's office and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the source said. That was a severance clause in his five-year contract as president, on which he has 20 months left. Under that clause, he was entitled to pay for those 20 months _ $ 297,000 _ if he severed his ties with the school, the official said. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> decided to take the severance pay and cut his ties with <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION>, the official said, explaining that the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> doctor `` is not someone with a lot of independent means'' and wants to keep his <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> home during his tenure in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. However, after news reports appeared about a possible arrangement, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> felt he was `` taking a beating in the press'' and decided `` on balance it was just not worth it,'' the source said. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> now plans to borrow money and his wife, a lawyer, will go back to work to make ends meet, the official said. In <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> earned $ 172,000 a year as <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> president. As <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> secretary, he would make $ 99,500, though that could go up to $ 155,000 if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approves a pending pay raise. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s decision to forgo the money surprised many in the nation's capital, though ethics officials say it is not unusual for people entering government to give up large sums of money due them from former employers. `` There are government people who give up unbelieveable sums to take government positions ... because they are afraid it could create a problem for them,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, deputy director of the Office of Government Ethics. `` It happens with frequency.'' However, there are also people at <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s level who do take large sums from former employers, `` deferred income'' that is legally theirs because it had been earned before they came to the government or money afforded them in a contract buyout clause, for example. The new agriculture secretary, <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, last year while he was <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative received $ 561,602 from the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> for an annual installment for deferred earnings plus the after-tax proceeds of a lump sum distribution. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> had been president of the exchange before joining the <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, however, feared that his leave from <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION>, combined with controversy over his statements about abortion and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s focus on his connection to a <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> politician convicted of extortion, could affect his crediblity and that of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, the source said The official quoted <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> as saying that he `` simply accepted this as unfortunate, but this is a cost of becoming part of the government.'' On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which will hold <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s confirmation hearing, praised the nominee, saying his decision to give up the funds `` shows a major personal commitment to public service.'' Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, said he admired <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> for his decision, but said no one should be pressured to give up funds to which they are legally entitled. `` We have so much pressure in the government, only those born with two gold spoons in their mouth will be able to serve around here pretty soon,'' he said. `` It is impossible for me to understand this pressure that comes on people who were not born wealthy and who have earned a certain right.''

<TEXT>
 A convoy of Soviet paratroopers came home from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on Monday to a bittersweet brass-band welcome, and a military spokesman said 20,000 Soviet soldiers remain in the country. The 350th Parachute Regiment, which had been stationed in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> since 1984, rumbled across the Friendship Bridge spanning the <LOCATION> Amu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and into <LOCATION> Termez </LOCATION>, red flags waving and headlights shining on the 60 tanks and armored personnel carriers. A 20-piece military band played the Soviet national anthem and martial airs. The 300 paratroopers, commanded by Lt. Col. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Skachkov </PERSON>, were presented with red carnations, which they pushed down the barrels of the weapons on their armored vehicles and into the muzzles of their submachine guns. That sign of peace marked the end of their involvement in the conflict that took the lives of more than 13,000 Soviet soldiers and injured 35,000 others. Soviet officials brought about 150 foreign correspondents to this border town in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> for the welcoming ceremonies. Despite the publicity effort, the welcome was a relatively low-level affair. The highest-ranking official to speak was <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Sudarenkov </PERSON>, first deputy prime minister of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>. Hayratan, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, on the other side of the river is the terminus of the Salang Highway from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the main withdrawal route of the Soviet soldiers. Convoy after convoy of withdrawing soldiers reached the border area in the past week. But <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> officials bused in hundreds of school children and workers to give an official welcome to the 350th Parachute Regiment. The workers and students were entertained with loud popular music, including <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> artist <PERSON> Stevie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wonder </PERSON>'s `` I Just Called to Say I Love You,'' and ate food provided by several dozen specially installed stands. A freight train carrying military equipment could be seen crossing the bridge before the spectators pressed to the edge of the reviewing stand to catch the first glimpse of the returning warriors. Just before the welcome, military spokesman Lt. Col. <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Korolev </PERSON> said the last remaining Soviet soldiers in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> were on the move toward the border. <PERSON> Korolev </PERSON> said that as of 8 a.m. Monday, `` more than 30,000 soldiers have left in the second half of the withdrawal.'' The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> withdrew half of its 100,000 soldiers from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Aug. 15 and must complete the second half of the pullout by Feb. 15, under a U.N.-brokered agreement. The Kremlin intervened militarily in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979. <PERSON> Korolev </PERSON> said fewer than 20,000 Soviet soldiers remained in <LOCATION> Balkh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Samangan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baglan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Parvan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION> provinces, and that they were moving toward the border on Monday. <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION>, as well as the four north-central provinces between <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and the border, are along main withdrawal routes. The soldiers are returning to a society where the opposition of many to the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> war and indifference to their service have caused returning soldiers difficulty in adjusting. Dozens of people in the crowd in <LOCATION> Termez </LOCATION> were searching for familiar faces among the group of returning <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> veterans. One of the few who were successful was <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabriba </PERSON>, who found her grandson, <PERSON> Eldar </PERSON> <PERSON> Galiev </PERSON>. The diminutive grandmother's face lit up as she told reporters she had seen her grandson. She said he had written a letter saying he was in <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>, rather than <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, so that she would n't worry about him `` At least he's healthy,'' she said, beaming. <PERSON> Sudarenkov </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> official, said, `` We wish you to join the front ranks of those fighting for revolutionary change'' in Soviet society. The tanks, armored personnel carriers and armored cars that carried the returning soldiers held banners proclaiming `` peace to you, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'' and `` the order of the fatherland has been fulfilled.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> on Monday formally approved the expanded use of an aerosol version of the drug pentamidine to fight a life-threatening pneumonia that strikes AIDS patients. Under the new rules, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has approved the experimental use of aerosol pentamidine for AIDS patients who have had at least one episode of penumocystic carinii pneumonia, or who have white blood cell counts that are at or below 200 per cubic millimeter. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> action recommends the use of aerosol pentamidine every four weeks as a preventive measure against the AIDS-related pneumonia. The injectable form of the drug was approved in 1984 for patients who already had the pneumonia. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval came after a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> study showed that using aerosol pentamidine lowered the incidence of the pneumonia among AIDS patients. AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious disease that renders the body unable to resist other diseases and infections. It is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV. A white blood cell called T4 helper is the primary immune cell attacked by HIV. Most healthy people have T4 helper cell counts of 1,000 per cubic millimeter. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia is the most common infection that kills AIDS patients.

 Thousands of ethnic <PERSON> Albanians </PERSON> left work Monday in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> province to protest alleged anti-Albanian policies in some parts of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, according to reports by the official news agency and other sources. The strikes, and rallies that appeared to defy a ban on mass gatherings in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, followed weekend protests by more than 1,500 employees of the <ORGANIZATION> Trepca </ORGANIZATION> lead-zinc mine near <LOCATION> Titova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mitrovica </LOCATION> in the southern province. Ethnic Albanians are 85 percent of the people in southern province, which adjoins <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>. The Trepca miners held a meeting to protest what they describe as growing anti-Albanian sentiment fed by official media in <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, the nation's largest republic. <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> is an autonomous province within <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, which says it needs more control over the Albanian-dominated region to protect its Slavic minority. Up to 100,000 ethnic Albanians demonstrated in <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, in November against the dismissal of some top provincial officials as demanded by <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s leaders. After five days of the largest rallies in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s history, police put an indefinite ban on mass gatherings. Informed sources in <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION> said the protests Monday involved at least 3,000 ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> employees in about 15 factories and mines. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s official news agency, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION>, said protesters denounced Serbian allegations that ethnic Albanians are separatists whose ultimate goal is making <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> part of <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>.

 The nation's largest organization of lawyers went on record Monday in favor of legislation to bar discrimination against homosexuals. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which twice before rejected similar proposals, endorsed a resolution supporting federal, state and local legislation `` prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in employment, housing and public accommodations.'' The <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION>, the policy-making body for the 350,000-member lawyers' organization, voted 251-121 to adopt the resolution. Members said the action will have important symbolic and practical impact in influencing lawmakers to adopt gay-right measures. The House of Delegates also approved, by voice vote, a proposal calling for increased federal regulation of the insurance industry. The proposal urges passage of federal legislation repealing the antitrust exemption the insurance industry was granted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1945. The <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> resolution is a response to the so-called liability crisis in which lawyers and insurance companies have blamed each other for the skyrocketing costs of liability insurance. Proponents of the gay-rights resolution noted that many states and cities already have legislation to protect the rights of homosexuals. Many states and cities already have legislation to protect the rights of homosexuals. Laws banning discrimination in public employment based on sexual orientation have been adopted by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. Many cities have enacted more sweeping protection. In a debate that was at times emotional, proponents of the gay-rights measure said the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> is behind the times in speaking out in behalf of homosexual rights. `` It's a question of basic human rights,'' said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Forger </PERSON>, a lawyer from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` What we do here today is simply make a statement in favor of decency and human rights, a compassionate voice for social justice.'' But opponents of the resolution said the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> is taking sides with `` perversion'' and the corruption of children. The <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> is `` encouraging a federal statute that will invade the rights of every American,'' said <PERSON> Augustine </PERSON> <PERSON> Smythe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> `` We should n't ram it down people's throats with a federal statute,'' he said. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Stamper </PERSON> of Antlers, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, said the resolution endorses homosexual conduct. `` A majority of Americans looks with distaste on perversity that violates our religious precepts,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION> rejected a similar proposal by nine votes in 1985 and by 24 votes in 1983. In 1987, the group approved a resolution condemning crimes of violence based on prejudice against the victim's race, religion, sexual orientation or minority status. Supporters of the gay-rights proposal emphasized that homosexuality is not a matter of choice for most. They also said there is no scientific evidence to show homosexuals are more likely than heterosexuals to molest children. <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Richmond </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> said, `` It's important to me to separate out conduct that would be offensive, whether by heterosexuals or homosexuals.'' She said that when she was in the sixth grade she succeeded in getting a male teacher fired for making sexual advances to her. Endorsing equal treatment for homosexuals does not mean condoning conduct that would be offensive or illegal, she said. Earlier Monday, Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> called for measures to limit the time in which death row inmates may challenge in federal court their convictions and death sentences. <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said such a limit should be combined with expanded legal help for those accused of capital crimes to ensure that constitutional challenges to death penalty sentences are handled more efficiently.

 <ORGANIZATION> UNITED </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NATIONS </ORGANIZATION> - <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s foreign minister on Monday proposed a joint U.S.-Central American campaign to wipe out the `` diabolical scourge'' of drug trafficking in the region. <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Escoto </PERSON> met reporters after talking to Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> about a proposed international military observer force to police the Central American peace plan. <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> is leading a meeting Wednesday and Thursday of foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, which signed the 1987 peace plan. `` We will be proposing an agreement between the Central American republics and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on the elimination of illegal drug trafficking,'' said d'Escoto. `` This is a scourge on the world; we were very, very happy to see the priority that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gave to this issue in his inaugural address,'' he said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> backs the rebels seeking to overthrow the leftist Sandinista government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. But the Nicaraguan government has spoken in favor of improving relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since the change in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administrations last month. <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is volunteering to draft an agreement that would be submitted to the other Central American countries and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, followed by a meeting of those involved in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> would not provide other details of the proposal and declined to say whether <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> would be prepared to share intelligence data or coast guard duties with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We would be proposing to go as far as we should go in order to really stamp out this diabolical sourge to humanity,'' he said. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, which is ruled by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON>, is considered part of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, not <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON> has been charged with drug trafficking in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> federal courts, but says the charges are false and are an attempt to lay the groundwork for abrogating the treaty under which control of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> will pass from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has defended <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, saying he is a victim of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> persecution intended to undermine <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s sovereignty.

 Exiled Philippine President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> remained in critical but stable condition Monday, after marked improvement over the weekend, according to a hospital spokeswoman. The 71-year-old <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> recognized family and friends and was able to respond to simple commands, such as to raise his right hand, said <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Kop </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> remained in the intensive care unit attached to a respirator to regulate his breathing, <PERSON> Kop </PERSON> said. `` He's still in critical, but he's showing signs of improvement,'' she said. `` He's more alert.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has been hospitalized since Jan. 15 with pneumonia and bronchial asthma. While in the hospital, he suffered a collapsed lung, which was reinflated, and underwent a tracheotomy to relieve the buildup of fluids in his lungs. Along with his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was indicted last October on federal racketeering charges accusing him of plundering his homeland's economy and stashing much of the money in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A hearing this week in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to decide whether he is healthy enough to stand trial has been postponed until March 6. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> confirmed that the hearing before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>, had been put off at the defense' request. Ms. <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> would not comment on why the defense had sought a delay, saying it was not on the public record. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> pleaded innocent to the charges and is free on $ 5 million bail. Philippine Vice President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> visited <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> on Thursday in the hospital and said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> should be forgiven and allowed to die in his homeland, where he ruled for 20 years. Philippine President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has refused to meet with <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> and receive a message from <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. `` It is not a matter of me not wanting to talk to him, but I feel since he says this is a matter of great import to the Filipino people, I think he should inform the people directly instead of with me because people might have the wrong impressions that we are keeping something from them,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said Monday in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was ousted in a February 1986 civilian-military revolt and has lived in <LOCATION> Hawaiian </LOCATION> exile since, with Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> forbidding his return.

<TEXT>
 Country singer <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Paycheck </PERSON>, after pleading to a judge for mercy, was taken to jail Monday to begin serving a 7-to-9 -LCB- - year sentence for his conviction in a 1985 tavern shooting It was Paycheck's second sentencing in the case and was the same term he received at the original May 1986 sentencing. Paycheck, 50, a native of nearby <LOCATION> Greenfield </LOCATION>, pleaded for leniency, saying he needs to earn money in concerts because his wife has cancer, they have no health insurance and he is paying cash for her medical treatments. `` If I'm taken away, my wife will be dead in six months,'' Paycheck told Judge <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Hottle </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Common Pleas Court in southwest <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Hottle </PERSON>, after hearing testimony from Paycheck and four character witnesses, gave Paycheck the same term that he ordered in 1986. The 4th <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ordered the resentencing hearing, saying Paycheck should be given a chance to present testimony that might persuade the judge to shorten the sentence. Paycheck, whose real name is <PERSON> Donnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>, was convicted of aggravated assault, tampering with evidence _ for discarding the handgun he used _ and use of a firearm during a felony. Paycheck was handcuffed after his sentencing and taken to a Hillsboro-area jail to await his transfer later this week to a state prison. <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> songwriter <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> McDuffy </PERSON>, testifying Monday for Paycheck, said he had known Paycheck since 1963 and described him as a humanitarian. <PERSON> McDuffy </PERSON> and fellow witness <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, a publisher-producer, said Paycheck was involved in producing a gospel album to raise money for the fight against AIDS. Paycheck, who now lives in <LOCATION> Cadiz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, had been free on $ 50,000 bond. The singer is best known for his 1978 hit, `` Take This Job and Shove It.''

 Socialist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>, expected to defeat conservative Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> in this week's election, said Monday he would restore diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> but give higher priority to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ties <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> said he wants a `` new beginning'' with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and and would visit <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> before restoring ties with <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s communist government. The 64-year-old former prime minister, in an interview at his <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> home with seven foreign correspondents, said he saw clear opportunities for cooperation with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including cracking down on drug trafficking through <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>. An opinion poll published Sunday put <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>'s left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> 14 points ahead of <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON>'s center-right <ORGANIZATION> Jamaica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, 57 percent to 43 percent. Thursday's voting will be the first nationally contested election since 1980, when 700 people were killed in politically related violence during a nine-month campaign. At least eight people have been killed and scores injured in political attacks since this campaign opened Jan. 15. Police said eight people were wounded in three separate shootings Sunday night in and near <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>, the capital. Six people were attacked leaving a political meeting. Two others, a 22-ear-old man and a 15-year-old boy, were hit by shots fired from passing buses carrying political supporters. Nevertheless, the violence has not been anywhere near as intense or widespread as it was in 1980. <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>'s party boycotted the last election, in 1983, in a dispute over voter registration lists. At the time, <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON>, one of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's closest allies in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, was riding a wave of popularity following his outspoken support of the 1983 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>. The boycott left <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON>'s party with all 60 seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>, who was prime minister for eight years during the 1970s, said he was confident of winning at least 40 parliamentary seats to <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON>'s 20. <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> reiterated his pledge to restore diplomatic relations with neighboring <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, but he said he would not bring back droves of <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> doctors and builders, as he did in the 1970s. <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>'s close ties with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> alienated the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and foreign investors, leading to economic decline. <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> broke relations with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> shortly after taking office for the first time in 1980. Asked about his image as a radical-turned-moderate, <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> rejected the notion he espoused far-left views. `` I never was what you call a hard-line socialist,'' said <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>, who is vice president of the influential movement <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. `` I've always belonged to that broad family of social democracy. `` What I really am, if you want to know, is a hard-line democrat,'' he continued. `` But not Democrat vs. Republican.

<HEAD>Nicaragua Devalues Currency For Third Time This Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The leftist Sandinista government devalued the currency and raised prices for petroleum products on Monday for the third time this year. The devaluation of the cordoba is part of economic measures designed to contain hyperinflation, which reached 20,000 percent in 1988. The official rate of exchange for the cordoba went from 2,300 to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar to 2,700. The cordoba was devalued Jan. 4 from 920 to 2,000 per dollar at the official rate of exchange, and then from 2,000 to the dollar to 2,300 Jan. 25. The dollar continued trading at 5,200 cordobas on the black market and 4,500 cordobas in the so-called parallel market. The government-authorized parallel market complements the official one and serves to provide dollars for non-essential imports. As the cordoba is devalued, prices for petroleum products have been rising proportionately. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has no petroleum resources of its own and must import all its crude oil, mostly from Soviet bloc countries. Diesel fuel went from 3,500 cordobas a gallon to 4,100 a gallon after Monday's devaluation; and gasoline rose from 4,800 cordobas a gallon to 5,600. Meanwhile, the official <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Barricada </ORGANIZATION> quoted Finance Minister <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hupper </PERSON> as saying tax laws will be applied rigorously this year and tax evaders will be prosecuted. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> on Jan. 30 announced his government's 1989 economic plan, which included budget cuts of more than 40 percent and the laying off of at least 30,000 government workers Opposition leaders and private businessmen say these measures will not be effective unless the government works out a political accord with them. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s economy has been hurt by eight years of war with the U.S.-backed Contra rebels, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade embargo in force since 1985, and <PERSON> Hurricane </PERSON> <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>, which struck this Central American country last October and inflicted heavy damage on agriculture. The Sandinistas and the Contras signed a temporary cease-fire in March 1988, which the government has been extending on a month-by-month basis. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> stopped military aid to the Contras in February 1988.

<HEAD>Freight Workers Make A Killing On Stock Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Employees of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consortium </ORGANIZATION> who bought stock in their company in 1982 for about 4 cents a share saw their fortunes soar Monday when it began trading on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stock exchange at 100 times that price. News reports said one mechanic, who was not identified, had $ 3.8 million worth of stock at Monday's prices. About 10,000 typists, truck drivers and managers bought into the struggling freight transport giant when the government sold it off in an early privatization seven years ago. In 1982, the workers ignored union advice, skeptical financial experts and a severe recession in road transport to raise $ 92.5 million to buy their firm. Some emptied their savings accounts, mortgaged their homes, or borrowed the money. Year after year of expansion and success followed, and on Monday their shares sold for a closing price of $ 4.32 a share. At the closing price, the company once known as the lame-duck road transport arm of British Railways was valued at $ 1.38 billion. Previously the company's shares _ all but 17 percent held by staff, workers, retired workers and relatives _ have been traded on an internal market. It was that `` private exchange'' that set Monday's starting price of $ 3.20. Before the flotation the shares were standing at $ 3.20, but with most of the workers refusing to sell, demand for the new stock sent the price shooting up. Only a few of the investors, including the mystery mechanic and chairman Sir <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, will be millionaires. Four hundred other workers are believed to hold stock that rose to be worth at least $ 432,500 during the years since the privatization. On Monday's bumper profits, their stock is now worth $ 583,875.

<HEAD>Banks, Foreign Exchange Houses Closed Due to Inflation, Interest

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Banks and foreign exchange houses were ordered closed Monday as the government grappled with how to lower interest rates while keeping the currency stable. The Economy Ministry ordered the closings late Sunday night after a week in which the austral fell to 17.59 to the dollar on the open market, monthly interest rates to 17 percent or more, and the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> lost nearly $ 500 million in foreign exchange. The government ordered a 2.5 percent devaluation in the official value of the austral, to 14.41 australs to the dollar, effective Tuesday, when the banks and foreign exchanges were scheduled to reopen. Also beginning Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> _ which has spent at least $ 1 billion in recent months in an effort to hold down the dollar _ no longer will make dollars available on the free market. The former commercial rate, which was higher and at which the government used to sell dollars and make a profit, will be replaced by a `` special'' rate equal to the official rate plus 25 percent _ i.e., 18.01 australs per dollar beginning Tuesday. The free rate will be whatever the market will bear. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> no longer with try to keep the `` black market'' value of the dollar within 20 percent of the official value. The problem, as always, is inflation, which was an unexpectedly high 8.9 percent in January, a rise from December's 6.8 percent and November's 5.7 percent, and an indication that despite strenuous efforts the government is losing control. In August, President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> implemented a program of voluntary wage and price controls, budget cuts and regular mini-devaluations in the austral. To persuade Argentines not to trade their money for dollars, which deprives the banking system of funds and drives up interest rates, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> made plenty of dollars available. Interest rates were kept attractively high though well below levels of last July and August. Through November the plan seemed to work. Inflation and monthly interest rates both returned to single digits, the dollar rose modestly and, of crucial importance, Argentines' purchasing power recovered from the months when it lagged behind inflation. National elections are set for May 14. Critics said any improvement was illusory because it was obvious the dollar was undervalued, and as soon as that was common knowledge, speculators would buy dollars in anticipation of profits. One indication that was near was Argentines' huge rush to buy airline tickets, figuring that as they were denominated in dollars, they could be bought at a substantial discount. By the government's tallies, the austral lost 42 percent of its value since September, while the dollar rose by only about 27 percent. Middle-class Argentines who ordinarily might have vacationed at the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coastal resort Mar del Plata 250 miles south of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> decided to vacation in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. Tickets to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> also were particularly cheap and popular.

 A man accused of killing 14 relatives in a Christmastime rampage went on trial Monday for the slayings, even though he has said he is ready to die for his convictions of two other murders. Two of the 89 potential jurors were excused during preliminary questioning Monday. After that, individual questioning began to select a panel for the trial of <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>. Earlier Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> denied a motion to let the jury decide whether the deaths of <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' relatives were part of the same criminal episode in which two people were killed in <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION> on Dec. 28, 1987 <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, 48, was convicted May 12 for those slayings and sentenced to death. He told <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> he was ready to die and did not want his sentence appealed. Eight prospective jurors were excused by <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>; four said they thought <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> was guilty. One of those excused, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, said: `` I think he ought to get 30 days in the electric chair. And the do-gooders who intervened last time when he asked to be executed ought to have to hold his hand.'' Four jurors were selected Monday. The state indicated it would call 20 witnesses in the current trial. The defense indicated it would call three. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' first trial was moved to Ozark because of publicity in <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION>, and the second trial was moved to <LOCATION> Clarksville </LOCATION> for the same reason. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> addressed that issue when he asked the potential jurors, `` Is there anybody who has not heard anything about this case?'' Nobody raised their hand. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> told the jury that he realized that `` the court can not make you just wipe things out of your mind and forget it,'' but that verdicts must be based upon a higher quality of evidence than what is sometimes reported by the media. The new trial is for the shooting and strangulation deaths of <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Becky </PERSON>, 46; their seven children; two of the children's spouses; and four of <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' grandchildren, one of whom relatives say he fathered by incest with one of his daughters. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> also presided over <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' earlier trial. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> surrendered after the shooting spree that left two people dead and authorities then went to his home 14 miles north of <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION>. They found five bodies. The next day, they discovered seven bodies in a grave and found the bodies of two babies in the trunks of cars. Prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON> said he would ask for the death penalty. The jury could give <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> life imprisonment without parole.

 A Mardi Gras tourist who told robbers he had no money was fatally shot Monday about two blocks from a parade route, police said. The victim, <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Robichaux </PERSON>, 37, of <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, was an employee at <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who came to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> to see the Bacchus parade Sunday night, police said. The shooting occured the day before <PERSON> Mardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gras </PERSON>, the culmination of pre-Lenten festivities. The city's Carnival parades began two weeks ago. A companion told police that he and <PERSON> Robichaux </PERSON> were about two blocks from the parade route about 1 a.m. when three men in a car drove up and repeatedly demanded money. The parade had been over for a couple of hours. When <PERSON> Robichaux </PERSON> said he had no money, one of the men got out and shot him in the chest, according to police. <PERSON> Robichaux </PERSON> died later at a hospital. <PERSON> Robichaux </PERSON> was in charge of running four dormitories at the university; co-workers said he also made the campus <PERSON> Mardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gras </PERSON> parade into a major event. Police said the city's central business district is heavily patrolled during <ORGANIZATION> Carnival </ORGANIZATION>, but that many people put themselves in danger by parking in remote parts of the area and walking back to their cars in the early hours. But police said shootings during attempted robberies are highly unusual at <LOCATION> Mardi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gras </LOCATION>. The shooting was not the only weekend violence connected with Carnival. Two float riders suffered minor injuries when they were hit by objects thrown at them, police spokeswoman <PERSON> Yvonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bechet </PERSON> said. A third person, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowell </PERSON>, 24, of <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON>, was injured when he fell about 12 feet from the float he was on. He was in satisfactory condition at <ORGANIZATION> Tulane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bechet </PERSON> said. A month of parades and balls comes to an end at midnight on <LOCATION> Mardi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gras </LOCATION>, or Fat Tuesday, when Carnival season ends and Lent brings six weeks of repentance to this predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> city. About 1.5 million to 1.7 million people are expected to be in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>' streets Tuesday for the celebration.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Police on Monday arrested one of three opposition leaders who called for a 48-hour general strike to protest the rule of Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril. <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerre </PERSON>, leader of the small <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patriots </ORGANIZATION> party, was arrested at his home in the northern suburb of <LOCATION> Delmas </LOCATION> and taken to police headquarters in <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>, said his wife, <PERSON> Huguette </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerre </PERSON>. `` They said that this act was part of a round-up, that my husband was not the only one concerned,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Guerre </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Independent station <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropole </ORGANIZATION> said police confirmed the arrest. Police did not say how long he would be held or why he was arrested. <PERSON> Guerre </PERSON> and opposition leaders <PERSON> Sylvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> and <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dejoie </PERSON> in a joint statement Friday called for a general strike Wednesday and Thursday which they said `` will have the force of a referendum against <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>.'' The three said they would boycott <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>'s `` democratic forum'' on Thursday in which government and political leaders are to discuss the powers of an electoral board that is to supervise future elections. They say <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s constitution already provides for an independently appointed <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> with total control over elections. `` The Avril government is in the process of establishing a dictatorship. It intends to arrest all leaders who are opposed to his regime,'' <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> said after hearing of <PERSON> Guerre </PERSON>'s arrest. Conservative politician <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronceray </PERSON> and the Autonomous Central of Haitian Workers, the largest union, announced their support for the strike. The union has called two successful strikes in the last three months. `` The arrest -LRB- of Guerre -RRB- is outrageous and is an indication of <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>'s Duvalierist commitmen,'' <PERSON> Dejoie </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his home in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> came to power in a Sept. 17 coup by rank-and-file soldiers who ousted former ruler Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>, demanding a return to democratic rule. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> came to power in 1986 when former dictator <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Sentencing Hearing Begins For 25 Blacks Convicted Of Murder</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN PARKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UPINGTON, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A sentencing hearing began Monday for 25 blacks who could face the death penalty for their alleged complicity in the mob killing of a policeman. The so-called <LOCATION> Upington </LOCATION> 25 are believed to be the largest group ever convicted in a South African murder trial. Their case is similar to that of the `` <ORGANIZATION> Sharpeville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Six </ORGANIZATION>,'' a group of blacks reprieved from the gallows last year by President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> following a storm of international protest. In both instances, the prosecution was unable to show that most of the defendants physically contributed to the killing. However, the judges found the defendants guilty under the doctrine of common purpose, which holds them responsible because they were part of a crowd that intended to kill the victim. The <LOCATION> Upington </LOCATION> 25 were convicted of murder last year for the Nov. 13, 1985, killing of a black policeman, <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sethwala </PERSON>, who was assaulted and set alight by members of the mob after they chased him from his house. Evidence presented at the trial identified four of the 25 as the men primarily responsible for the assault that killed <PERSON> Sethwala </PERSON>. Judge <PERSON> J.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Basson </PERSON> convicted the remaining 21 because he said they shared the same intent. The group began attacking <PERSON> Sethwala </PERSON> and his house after police broke up a rally protesting a rent increase and other grievances. Black activists have attacked hundreds of black policemen in recent years, saying they are collaborators with the white-led government. The <LOCATION> Upington </LOCATION> 25 have received scant publicity because the town is located in the isolated northwestern part of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. However, when the sentencing hearing began Monday morning the packed courthouse included both South African and foreign journalists. It was not immediately clear how many days the hearing would last. During the hearing, defense lawyers will call expert witnesses to argue that the judge should not impose the death sentence because of extenuating social and political factors. The <LOCATION> Upington </LOCATION> 25 range in age from 21 to 64 and include three women. All are from <LOCATION> Paballello </LOCATION>, a black township on the edge of <LOCATION> Upington </LOCATION>. The Sharpeville Six, five men and a woman, are serving prison terms ranging from 18 years to 25 years, which were imposed when <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> commuted their death sentences. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has never explained his decision to intervene, although most observers said the extensive international pressure persuaded him to block the executions.

 A son-in-law of the late <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> was sentenced Monday to nearly four years in prison and ordered to pay more than $ 600,000 restitution to insurance companies. `` I just want to express to my family and friends my sincere apologies for all the pain and suffering I have caused them,'' <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomonson </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Devitt </PERSON> before sentencing. `` I'm an honest man, a loyal man and I never intended to cause harm to them.

Defense attorney <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> added, `` Words can not express the full extent of his sorrow to his mother-in-law and the <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> family.'' <PERSON> Devitt </PERSON> ordered Solomonson to pay $ 616,761 to seven insurance companies and sentenced him to 46 months in jail. Solomonson is to start his sentence March 6. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shea </PERSON> asked for a stiff sentence, but gave no specifics. <PERSON> Solomonson </PERSON>, 47, was convicted in December for diverting $ 1.5 million from his two insurance agencies for personal use.

<HEAD>Annual Tibetan Religious Ceremony Canceled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities have canceled the Great Prayer Festival, a sacred annual event in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> that last year was the scene of anti-Chinese violence that claimed more than 20 lives. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Monday the festival in the Tibetan capital of <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> was canceled by the <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> and other <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> organizations. The decision was made after `` taking into consideration the opinions of the majority of lamas,'' <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said. It said related religious activities could be conducted in monasteries. The festival, which begins the eighth day of the first month of the Tibetan calendar, usually takes place in February and March. The <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> report did not say whether the riots last March were responsible for the decision to cancel this year's festival. It also did not mention whether the Jan. 28 death of the <PERSON> Panchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Tibetan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buddhism </ORGANIZATION>'s second-most revered man after the exiled <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, was related to the cancellation. On March 5, the final day of the 10-day event, <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks broke up the ceremonies by shouting anti-Chinese, pro-independence slogans, starting riots that led to an estimated 24 deaths. Chinese authorities said one policeman was killed in the riots. Twenty-five rioters were given prison terms. Chinese authorities hailed the opening of last year's festival as an example of how religious freedom is now protected in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and as a sign that <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> had returned to normal following riots the previous September and October. The Great Prayer Festival, which dates back to 1409, was halted by the communists in 1960, a year after a failed uprising drove the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> into exile, and not held again until 1986.

AIM quoted one survivor as saying that the attackers opened fire with bazookas and light arms.

Rebels of <ORGANIZATION> Mozambique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> have been fighting since 1977 in a bid to undermine the country's Marxist government.

 Up to 7 feet of snow surprised <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> ski area owners Monday and closed roads, while the spread of the arctic cold wave turned highways into dangerous skating rinks with snow and freezing rain from the deep South to the Northeast. A week after the arctic air that stunned <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> crossed <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> into the Lower 48, thermometers dropped to 49 degrees below zero at <LOCATION> Craig </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, with an unofficial minus 52 at nearby <LOCATION> Hayden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> hit a low of 31 degrees, lowest for February since record-keeping began in 1872. Icy roads caused accidents and slowed commuters from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> to metropolitan <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. At least 56 deaths have been blamed on the weather since Jan. 31, most of them in traffic accidents or from hypothermia. In <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, a paraplegic found dead Sunday apparently had gotten out of his car and into a wheelchair, which then slid down an icy ramp the man was unable to climb, police said. In <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, a couple and two of their children died Monday in an early-morning mobile home fire that started when an electric blanket wrapped around water pipes ignited the underside of the trailer, authorities said. Thirty-three cities posted record low temperatures Monday, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ely </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, dropped to 30 below zero, its coldest on record for any date. Other all-time records were 47 below zero at <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, erasing the previous record of 32 below, and 33 below at <LOCATION> Richfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> declared eastern <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> a weather disaster area as ranchers fought to rescue thousands of cattle and sheep buried in snow drifts. The <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> discovered <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Laird </PERSON>'s herd of 980 sheep buried in drifts as deep as 15 feet. <PERSON> Laird </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Pearl </PERSON>, said the family may be able to save 150 of them. Four-wheel-drive vehicles were used Monday to rescue more than 20 people from a hilltop country club near <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where they had been stranded since Saturday by icy roads. Humane Society members had gone to the <ORGANIZATION> Barton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday for a fundraiser, said <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, chairwoman of the event. `` We had a great time and raised a lot of money,'' Ms. <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> said. Stuck at the country club with them was an owl, a falcon, a turtle weighing several hundred pounds and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gros </PERSON> of `` Mutual of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>'s Wild Kingdom.'' Freezing rain was reported early Monday across the Eastern seaboard and south and west across <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and into the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and central <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> police were told to respond only to emergency calls because even their cars were sliding into curbs and posts. Northern and central <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> had power outages, downed trees and mounting traffic accidents, and ice closed major bridges and fallen trees blocked some secondary roads. `` We've got a solid sheet of ice, and there's little chance of relief,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Prather </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> office at <LOCATION> Batesville </LOCATION>. Schools and numerous businesses were closed as far south as the <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> area of central <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> by icy roads and power outages. Heavy snow closed parts of highways Monday in northern and central <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, caused scattered power outages and closed schools in more than a dozen towns. `` I do n't think we've ever had a bigger storm,'' said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Enchanted </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ski </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> at Red River, which got 2 feet of snow. `` This is the first time in 25 years that we've had to close our ski area down because of the weather.'' The Red River ski area in northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> got 7 feet of snow over the weekend, mostly on Sunday, and the nearby Angel Fire resort got 6 feet, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Ski </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> agency. On Sunday, wind estimated at 80 mph blew railroad cars off tracks near <LOCATION> Abo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, west of <LOCATION> Mountainair </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> superintendent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ish </PERSON>. No injuries were reported, <PERSON> Ish </PERSON> said. About 20 school districts in northern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> were closed Monday after the <ORGANIZATION> Lone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> enacted emergency natural gas conservation measures to ensure sufficient supplies for home and business heat. Natural gas problems also affected Las Vegas. The record-tying low of 19 degrees at <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> coincided with a malfunction in a compressor station, and <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> officials issued an urgent plea Monday for people to cut back on gas use or to expect forced reductions. It also cut off service to some large industrial customers; large hotels were expected to switch to auxiliary fuel such as oil. More than 6 inches of snow fell on much of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, providing some encouragement for farmers who feared the shortage of winter moisture was a harbinger of another drought. `` The farmers are looking for this _ this is like money in the bank for them,'' said meteorologist <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachowski </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. But the snowfall also caused headaches for <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s Street and <ORGANIZATION> Sanitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> after 200 backup workers did n't respond to messages left on answering machines or with relatives over the weekend. Officials made plans to discipline the workers. Major city school districts in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> opened their doors Monday for the first time since Tuesday as temperatures moderated, but the warming trend was potentially bad news for boat owners. Deputy <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Multnomah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's office <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> said pleasure boats and houseboats on the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Willamette </LOCATION> rivers `` are all frozen in now, but they will sink when it thaws.''

 All 33 foreigners on trial for refusing to be fingerprinted under <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Alien Registration Law said Monday they will reject a planned amnesty marking Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s funeral. The 30 Koreans, two Americans and one Chinese said the amnesty would leave them unable to challenge the controversial law in court. The law's opponents say it violates the human rights of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s approximately 870,000 foreign residents by requiring them to be fingerprinted and carry an alien registration card at all times `` The government has declared an amnesty that will in the name of the late emperor dismiss our court cases and nullify all attempts at legal redress,'' the group said in a statement. `` Not only is the government denying us due process _ the right to a fair trial and the right to appeal _ it is also trying to silence us, hide the past and distort history.'' Many of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s foreign residents are Koreans or Chinese whose parents or grandparents were brought forcibly to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> as laborers while their countries were controlled by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> before and during World War II. Foreigners born in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> do not automatically receive Japanese citizenship and often face discrimination in schools, housing, marriage and employment. Government officials say they plan to pardon about 30,000 people for minor criminal offenses, including violations of the Alien Registration Law, to commemorate Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s funeral on Feb. 24. `` The court is one of the few places where Koreans and Chinese can challenge the law,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricketts </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Scottsdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, one of the Americans in the group. `` When I was found guilty of violating the law, I was told I have the right to appeal, but now I'm told I do n't have that right. ... It's an attempt by the government to get rid of these trials, which have attracted a lot of attention in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and overseas.'' In its statement, the group charged that militarists used <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> and the emperor system to rally national support for colonizing neighboring countries and killing millions of people in World War II. `` We are challenging not only the alien registration system itself, but also the imperial ideology that undergirds it and that continues to legitimize and perpetuate ethnic discrimination and oppression in postwar <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' the group said. Conviction under the law carries a penalty of up to a year in prison and a $ 1,500 fine.

 Japanese officials discounted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressional concerns Monday and said they hope to proceed with co-production of a jet fighter by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> and the Japanese company that built the famous Zero during World War II. Some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators say the project will mean giving away <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> high technology that might allow <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to compete against the American aerospace industry. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials pushed for last year's co-production agreement to offset <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus `` The two sides spent a long time working on the agreement, and I believe it's a good agreement,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said on condition of anonymity. `` I hope we can proceed with development as scheduled.'' During Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s visit last week to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, five <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators urged President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to review the agreement to use the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-16 built by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> as the basis of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s future mainstay fighter jet, called the FSX. Japanese officials said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> originally planned to develop the $ 40 million plane on its own. `` We've told the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government that we do n't need any technology -LRB- for the plane -RRB- from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said a high defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` We had hoped to develop it alone, but because of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> requests, we agreed to co-development of the plane.'' He said the F-16 technology `` would probably make the project go more smoothly'' but `` it is n't clear how much it will actually benefit <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.'' Under the current agreement, reached after several years of negotiations, <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> is to head development, using technology from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and from the F-16. The American company is to act as a subcontractor to <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> and receive about 35-45 percent of the work, funded entirely by the Japanese government. The Japanese technology likely to be used in the plane includes sophisticated radar, advanced materials and a special control system used to maneuver short additional wings, called canards, which allow the plane to move horizontally or vertically without any change in the angle of the plane's body. Initially, 130 of the planes are to be built, with a possible follow-up order of about 100 more. Each FSX will cost $ 40 million, defense officials say. Although <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has made several types of aircraft, including the YS-11 civilian transport plane, its aviation industry remains small. During World War II, the nation turned out 25,000 military aircraft a year, including the famous Mitsubishi Zero fighter, but after <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s defeat, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> occupation forces closed down the industry until 1952, when Japanese companies began servicing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planes during the Korean War. Since then, the industry has relied heavily on defense contracts, including the development of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s current fighter jet, the F-1, and production of F-15 fighters under license from <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 The homeless man accused of strangling a pregnant doctor told police `` a voice'' ordered him to kill the pathologist, according to court papers filed Monday. Dr. <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinnant </PERSON>, 33, was raped, sodomized and strangled with a wire in her small office Jan. 7 at <ORGANIZATION> Bellevue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. Shortly after his arrest, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 22, told a detective that during the attack, `` She asked me, Why am I doing this?'' according to the detective's report. The detective, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Argenzio </PERSON>, reported that he asked <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> what his response was. After a pause, he asked again. `` He stated to me, ` It was just something I had to do,''' the detective reported. The exchange took place while <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> `` talked continuously'' in a room at <LOCATION> Kings </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> Jan. 9, `` sometimes about things unrelated to the murder,'' Argenzio's report said. `` But most of the time he went on about how he had to do it because something inside of him makes him do it,'' the report said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said that if someone had given him psychiatric help, the slaying would n't have occurred and `` the lady would still be alive,'' the detective reported. The crime reminded <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of an incident involving his girlfriend in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, the report said. <PERSON> Argenzio </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> as saying that a voice had told him to stab his girlfriend, but he had forgotten where he put his knife, so he beat her.

 Cartoonist <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Marlette </PERSON>, whose work brought The Atlanta Constitution a share of its first Pulitzer Prize in 20 years, resigned Monday to join <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Marlette </PERSON> was brought to the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> newspaper from The Charlotte -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Observer by former Constitution Editor <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON> resigned three months ago in a dispute with senior executives. Constitution Editorial Page Editor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Teepen </PERSON> said he knew of no disputes particularly involving the cartoonist. `` There have not been any clashes here over cartoons,'' <PERSON> Teepen </PERSON> said. But the 39-year-old <PERSON> Marlette </PERSON> said in his resignation letter that he had been upset by <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON>'s departure. `` As a native Southerner, I came here inspired by the vision of <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON> for world-class journalism in this region so richly deserving of it,'' <PERSON> Marlette </PERSON> wrote. `` Tragically, that dream was thwarted. Like many Southerners before me, I head north with a sense of sadness and longing for what might have been.'' <PERSON> Marlette </PERSON>, in an interview Monday with <ORGANIZATION> WSB-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, made no mention of any disputes or other problems. `` Leaving is a very sad ... thing. I feel real ambivalence about it,'' he said. `` At the same time, I'm excited about the opportunity.'' <PERSON> Marlette </PERSON>'s 1987 work at both the Observer and the Constitution won a 1988 Pulitzer Prize. `` Obviously, the addition of an exceptional talent such as <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Marlette </PERSON> to the editorial pages of Newsday and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION> will strengthen what we believe to be the best viewpoints in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION>, in a statement. <PERSON> Newsday </PERSON> has three editorial cartoonists. <PERSON> Marlette </PERSON> will begin work for <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION>, based on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, in `` around three weeks,'' <PERSON> Teepen </PERSON> said, adding that he was not sure if the cartoonist would produce any more drawings for the Constitution while he prepares to move. `` We'll be bringing in a good editorial cartoonist,'' <PERSON> Teepen </PERSON> said. `` We're looking at some folks.'' <PERSON> Marlette </PERSON> also writes the syndicated comic strip, `` Kudzu.''

 The road to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> is littered with burned-out Afghan army tanks, trucks and security posts abandoned by retreating communist forces. Dotted along the highway leading from the Pakistani border to the <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> capital about 120 miles to the west are signs of the collapse of the Afghan army in the area as Moslem insurgents move in. Guerrilla commanders say Afghan government forces began to disintegrate after Soviet troops pulled out of the area late last year under a total withdrawal plan now in its final days. `` The communists are all gone.

 As a broiling summer day dissolved into a sultry night at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coxsackie state prison, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Puma </PERSON> waited to see if five prison guards held hostage by prisoners would make it out alive.

He just collapsed in my arms, crying,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Puma </ORGANIZATION>, head of the state prison guards' union. <ORGANIZATION> Puma </ORGANIZATION> saw the pain in the faces of the guards and their families and came up with an idea: The union, through <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION>, established a `` captivity coverage'' insurance plan, with benefits to be paid to survivors of prison uprisings.

 The whole family helped out when <PERSON> Dican </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadjy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kabakjian </PERSON> began moonlighting in his basement in 1924, stretching his physics professor's salary and riding the crest of a promising new cancer treatment. <PERSON> Kabakjian </PERSON> was a great man and a brilliant scientist, said one neighbor in the middle-class suburb of towering trees, stately old houses, quiet dead-end streets and back yards big enough for great games of hide-and-go-seek. The business in the basement of the three-story, stucco-and-frame Victorian duplex helped get the Kabakjians through the Depression. It also did something else: it made theirs the only single residence on the government's list of the most toxic waste sites in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. For two decades, until <PERSON> Kabakjian </PERSON> died in 1945, the family supplied doctors and hospitals with radium-tipped needles to insert near cancerous tumors. `` I'd take the raw stuff and cook it until you get these radium crystals,'' said <PERSON> Kabakjian </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Kabakjian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, 74. Her sister <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> would weigh the crushed crystals and pack them into platinum needles. The physicist's sons <PERSON> Armen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> worked during vacations. <PERSON> Dicranouhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kabakjian </PERSON> helped her husband when she was n't keeping his house. Daughter <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON> kept the books. There was no fear of radiation then; far from it. Two decades after it was discovered, radium was hailed as a miracle treatment for everything from cancer to tonsilitis. It would be years before scientists learned that radium decays into radon gas that can cause cancer. The disease may not show up for 40 years. Someone living in the house 16 hours a day for their whole life stood a one-in-three chance of cancer, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Janosik </PERSON>, who is managing the cleanup for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Kabakjian </PERSON> died at 65 of abdominal cancer, in 1977. His son, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, died of bladder cancer in 1983, at age 37. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dooner </PERSON>, who delivered radium, died in 1984 at age 71 of cancer of the head and lungs. <PERSON> Dican </PERSON> <PERSON> Kabakjian </PERSON> did n't develop cancer. He died in 1945, at 70, of emphysema probably caused by fumes from the acid he used to process the radium ore. The <PERSON> Tallant </PERSON> family bought the house in 1949 and lived there until moving into a bigger place in 1961. <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Tallant </PERSON> died of breast cancer in 1969, at 54. The `` hot house'' came to light in 1962 during a search for forgotten radium sites. In 1964, authorities spent $ 200,000 to decontaminate it. They declared success after removing furniture, dishes, rugs and clothing, and after replacing windows, walls, sinks and a concrete basement floor. That September the couple who owned it, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kizirian </PERSON>, moved back in. But in 1983, during a survey of sites that might be eligible for federal cleanup assistance, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> found radon levels in the basement 10 times higher than allowable and gamma radiation, similar to X-rays, 3 -LCB- times higher. In 1985, the house was put on the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s Superfund list. Last August, white-suited workers equipped with oxygen masks, vacuums and <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON> counters arrived. They dismantled the house board by board and brick by brick. All but 1 -LCB- bricks had been contaminated with radium. The trees where neighborhood children played were uprooted; squirrels had scampered up them carrying radioactivity from the ground where <PERSON> Kabakjian </PERSON> dumped workshop waste. The yard was dug up, too, leaving a 9-foot-deep pit. About 240 feet of sewer line running down the street is contaminated and will have to be replaced. None of the surrounding houses have been found to be contaminated, but six lots showed higher-than-normal radioactivity, pushing the cleanup cost from $ 7.5 million to $ 9.5 million. `` I do n't feel a great deal of anxiety about radiation,'' said <PERSON> Georgianna </PERSON> <PERSON> Gretzenberg </PERSON>. The back door of the house she and her husband bought in 1987 is 20 to 30 yards from the chain-link fence that surrounds the empty lot and from the trailers where workers are checked for contamination. The free-standing garage they planned to turn into a studio may be lost to the cleanup. `` It's sad to see the neighborhood ripped up. For me, it's more that,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Gretzenberg </PERSON>, who had a healthy baby boy six months ago. `` My biggest concern is they wo n't finish. I hope it will be done so we can go back to doing what you do in suburbia.'' <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Click </PERSON>, who has lived behind the house for 23 years, said, `` We were told as long as it's not in our house, we should n't be concerned.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kizirian </PERSON>, whose family bought the house from the Tallants, wonders if the radium can be blamed for illnesses that afflicted his family, including sores that developed on his father's legs before he died `` That's the $ 64 question. Our understanding is the long-term effects of radiation have not been proven,'' said <PERSON> Kizirian </PERSON>. He has considered suing, but is n't sure who to sue, and lawyers say he's lucky the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> paid for the cleanup The costs included $ 140,000 paid to the Kizirians and the <PERSON> Basehore </PERSON> family, who lived in the other side of the duplex. The families retain ownership of the land, which will be filled and landscaped when the work is done this summer. <PERSON> Kizirian </PERSON> said that given its history, he doubts anyone will buy, so he and the other heirs to his parents' estate might donate it to the town. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Basehore </PERSON>, who is in her 70s, declined to talk at length about her experiences, but considers <PERSON> Kabakjian </PERSON> to be a great man. She has n't decided what to do when the property can be occupied again, either. `` Once the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> finishes they'll certify they do n't have a radiation problem,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bochanski </PERSON>, a borough councilman and former <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` That's more than some of us can say.'' <PERSON> Penny </PERSON> <PERSON> Flaherty </PERSON>, who rents the house next door, grew vegetables the summer of 1987, but <PERSON> Kabakjian </PERSON>'s legacy worried her. `` It was funny, I grew them and brought them in, but I had qualms about eating them and threw them out.''

 After reaching the 11th grade, <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> dropped out of school.

The turning point for <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> came 20 years ago, when he saw <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Kubrick </PERSON>'s science-fiction classic, `` 2001: A Space Odyssey.'' `` I thought, ` OK, that's what I'm doing.' I was haunted by it, had nightmares by it. I started going to off-beat things, foreign films. I found myself obsessed by stories that did n't have neat answers, that made me question things.'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> worked in the film library at the Museum of Modern Art, going through the museum's archives, and began appearing in school plays. But by the time he was in high school, he was ready to move on. `` I never did well with rules,'' said the director, just 16 when he left school. His professional acting career had already begun the year before when he joined the National Playwright's Conference at the <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> Theatre. He worked in stage, television and films over the next few years but dreamed of being on the other side of the camera. `` It was always in my heart to direct,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said. `` To be honest, I thought I would be 45 or 50, not 27.'' `` The Chocolate War'' is based on <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cormier </PERSON>'s best-selling novel, which gives a lurid account of life at a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> school in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, recalling his own unhappy experiences in school, was attracted to the issues dealt with in the book. `` I carried this book around in my head for 10 years. I wondered if stuff in the book was unrealistically harsh or vicious but I met people who had been sexually molested and repeatedly beaten up _ stuff where your mouth is hanging open.'' For years the book was passed around all the major studios, but when the rights finally became available, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> quickly snapped them up and persuaded <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Krane </PERSON>, an independent producer, to back the project. `` The crew was young. My cinematographer was only a few years older than me,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, who completed filming in just 24 shooting days, for a cost of $ 700,000. `` The Chocolate War'' stars <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glover </PERSON> as the sadistic <PERSON> Brother </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> as the ruthless leader of a student gang and <PERSON> Ilan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell-Smith </PERSON> as a freshman caught up the school's vicious atmosphere. Following the example of <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> made sure the crew, working on a limited budget, was properly appreciated. `` I'm almost proudest that we had a great time. Almost everybody who worked on that film said he never had more fun. On that kind of money, you'd be better be ... sure that they have a good time. Any director that does n't avail himself of the talent around him is a fool.'' He was tested early in the project. One day, after shooting for 15 hours, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> could sense that `` the natives were restless.'' `` I made a speech, bought pizzas and shook everybody's hands. I made sure they were heard. I made the producer give everybody an extra $ 100 for such a long day.'' When filming was over, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> gave himself high marks for his performance on the set. `` I was surprised how much fun it was. I expected to be more miserable, more panic struck,'' he said. `` I discovered I'm pretty good in panic situations. Parking tickets I get nervous breakdowns, but on the set I was very clear-headed.'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> seems unlikely to drop out of the film world. `` Ultimately, you're realizing your own vision,'' he said. `` It's collaborative, but also very personal Film involves literature, music, acting and lighting. It's a wonderful chance to stretch yourself in every direction at once.''

<HEAD>Priest Helps Jews Document Their Presence in Italy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTOR L. SIMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a basement along the <LOCATION> Tiber </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, a Roman Catholic priest is poring over thousands of dusty, worm-eaten books in a project to preserve precious remnants of Jewish culture in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. The collection of some 20,000 books, manuscripts and magazines helps document the vitality of what may be the oldest Jewish community in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, with its roots believed to predate the Christian era. But like other remnants, such as ancient synagogues and catacombs, much of the written record has deteriorated or been shipped to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for safekeeping. Now, however, through a combination of grants, a Nobel Prize-winner's contribution and volunteer work by the Rev. Pier <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Fumagalli </PERSON>, the books will be cataloged, restored and made available to the public in the new National Jewish Library and <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> when it opens in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> within a year or so. `` As long as there are Jews in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> they are entitled to their heritage,'' said <PERSON> Tullia </PERSON> <PERSON> Zevi </PERSON>, the driving force behind the project. Mrs. <PERSON> Zevi </PERSON> is president of the Union of Italian Jewish Communities, which represents the country's 40,000 Jews. Having successfully pressed for a turnover of the Jewish catacombs from <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> government jurisdiction five years ago, she next set her sights on placing collections of Jewish books from around <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> under one roof in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. Unable to afford a lay library expert, she turned to <PERSON> Fumagalli </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s leading Judaic scholars who worked for eight years at the 400-year-old Ambrosiano Library in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>. He is a member of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for Relations with <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>. He spends Monday afternoons working with four Jewish university students in the basement of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s Jewish school to cataloge the books stacked in metal cabinets and protected from further decay by a humidifier. Several thousand are in very bad shape, with their bindings worn off, pages yellowed and damaged by worms. `` It's a mutually enriching experience,'' he said, noting that the Jewish press in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> dates to the late 1400s. `` Culture is a measure of the vitality of a people.'' He said <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s Jewish press was the oldest in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. A Jewish press began in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> about the same time as <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s but closed down when Jews were expelled by <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> rulers in 1492. About 80 percent of the books in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> are in Hebrew, many of those from the collection of the <ORGANIZATION> Rabbinical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. Others have come from <LOCATION> Siena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ferrara </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pisa </LOCATION> and such towns as <LOCATION> Pitigliano </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Viterbo </LOCATION>, where there are no longer any Jews. In addition to prayer books and books on Jewish history and customs, there are publications and documents put out by the various communities that provide a glimpse of Jewish life in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> through the centuries. The government provided $ 460,000 for restoration of the library site, a former mechanic's workshop about 50 yards from the school and facing the monumental ochre-colored main synagogue across the Tiber. <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Levi-Montalcini </PERSON>, the Italian-American scientist, who is Jewish, contributed what Mrs. <PERSON> Zevi </PERSON> called a `` slice'' of the $ 145,000 cash prize that came with winning the Nobel Prize for medicine in 1986. The money allows the community to pay the students about $ 300 a month for their work with the library. <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION>, the business machine company, donated a computer for the book cataloging. The Jewish presence in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> is believed to date back 2,000 years. Its history was heavily conditioned by the papacy. In 1555, Pope <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> IV </PERSON> confined <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s Jews to a ghetto that stood until papal rule ended in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> in 1870. But according to Mrs. <PERSON> Zevi </PERSON>, Jews lost faith in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> only after the enactment of the racial laws by <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Mussolini </PERSON>'s fascist dictatorship in 1938, which foreshadowed deportions to Nazi death camps. More than 8,000 Jews were deported and only around 900 returned. Mrs. <PERSON> Zevi </PERSON> said many of those who emigrated on their own never came back while those who survived shipped valuable items to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. But attitudes appear to be changing. Italian Jews were heartened by the broad support from politicians at a recent convention examining the damage done by <PERSON> Mussolini </PERSON>'s racial laws. By the same token, Italian towns have shown an interest in restoring synagogues and other Jewish remnants. `` This is a 99 percent <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> country,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Zevi </PERSON> said. `` It prides itself on being pluralistic. We are the ones who can supply the pluralism.''

<HEAD>War Shattered Town in Mozambique Struggles to Rebuild</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MELINDA HAM</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILANGE, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two and a half years ago, 60,000 people lived in <LOCATION> Milange </LOCATION>, then a lively place with night clubs and shops and prospering from a large tea estate. But then <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s guerrilla war came to <LOCATION> Milange </LOCATION> and today only 5,000 remain; the others fled to safety in <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>, just two miles away; the night clubs and shops are heavily damaged, the tea estate razed. Grass pokes through potholes in the wide avenues. The destruction was wrought by the guerrillas who are trying to overthrow the southern African country's Marxist government. They occupied <LOCATION> Milange </LOCATION> in September, 1986. Government forces drove them into the <PERSON> bush </PERSON> last June. Now government troops are supervising the reconstruction of the town in northern <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s fertile <LOCATION> Zambezia </LOCATION> province. But reconstruction is slow. The rebels control much of the <PERSON> bush </PERSON>, isolating <LOCATION> Milange </LOCATION> and leaving it dependent on international aid brought in from <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>. A school and clinic have been rebuilt, but only three teachers are available for 1,500 children in the school and one medical assistant with scarcely any medicines runs the clinic. The <ORGANIZATION> Mozambique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> has begun rehabilitating the tea estate. It plans to bring equipment from other tea-growing regions and envisions some 500 workers reviving production that is so vital to the town's economy. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refugees </ORGANIZATION> is distributing seeds for cassava, groundnuts -LRB- peanuts -RRB- and maize -LRB- corn -RRB- to encourage Mozambican refugees in <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> to return to their abandoned homes. An estimated 640,000 Mozambicans have fled into <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> in recent years because of food shortages and the war between the government and the <ORGANIZATION> Mozambique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION>, known by its Portuguese acronoym ReNaMo. The guerrillas took up arms in 1977 in an attempt to install a pro-Western government in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> colony until independence in 1975. The refugees in <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> are among an estimated 1.2 million Mozambicans who have taken refuge in neighboring countries. But aid officials say those in <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> are slowly starting to return home, with 500 leaving in December, many headed for <LOCATION> Milange </LOCATION>. One recently returned refugee said he fled to <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> when he heard the rebels were coming. `` Those who stayed were beaten, and the women _ young or old _ were raped,'' said the father of five, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. `` I have come home because I feel safe with the Frelimo -LRB- government -RRB- soldiers and I want to plant my fields.'' Little effort has been made to rebuild <LOCATION> Milange </LOCATION>'s derelict town center. Instead, poeple have built grass huts on the edge of their fields around the town. A bulldozer, lent by aid donors, is clearing an airstrip for light planes to bring relief supplies. <LOCATION> Milange </LOCATION> is gradually coming back, but defense from rebel attacks is still a main concern. `` We will liquidate the armed bandits and construct freedom and progress,'' says a government poster on the wall of <LOCATION> Milange </LOCATION>'s vacant hotel.

<HEAD>Black Street Vendors Become Economic Force in South Africa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Kleinbooi </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsegeng </PERSON> is a typical black South African businessman. His premises are the sidewalk and he's spent much of his 15 years as a street vendor trying to dodge the police. Now, times are good. Matsegeng obtained a license in 1987 and sells an array of goods in a zone where vendors can operate freely. He is able to pay four helpers with income that has risen tenfold since he began peddling paper bags in 1974. <PERSON> Matsegeng </PERSON> and entrepreneurs like him personify the booming `` informal sector'' of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s economy _ hundreds of thousands of blacks who work for themselves outside the more structured, white-dominated realm of paychecks, job applications and tax forms. No one knows the exact scope of the informal sector, but experts believe it represents perhaps one-fourth of the country's economic activity and provides a living for at least a million blacks. President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has acknowledged the informal sector's role in creating jobs. Last year, he presented three mobile hot-dog stands to street vendors in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> and sampled stew at a sidewalk stall. Street vendors, known in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as hawkers, peddle everything from hair spray to handcrafts, sausages to sunglasses. Recently they have begun to work collectively to increase their economic influence. About 16,000 hawkers and owners of `` spaza shops'' _ small, unlicensed grocery stores operated inside homes in black townships _ have joined the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawkers </ORGANIZATION> and Informal Businesses. The council was founded in 1986 by <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Mavundla </PERSON>, 30, a former shop steward for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mineworkers </ORGANIZATION>, who was fired from a gold mine during a 1985 strike. Later that year, he saw some hawkers being chased by police and decided to form an organization to represent their interests. `` One old woman who could not run fast enough was caught, her goods destroyed and she was thrown in the back of a van,'' he recalled. `` I thought this should not happen to people who are trying to make an honest living.'' The council, financed by membership dues of 10 rand -LRB- $ 4 -RRB- a month, has a staff of 17. It campigns to ease licensing restrictions, provides legal aid to hawkers who face fines, and negotiates with businesses in hopes they will become more supportive of hawking. Hawkers are regulated by local authorities, and many of the 700 municipal governments maintain bans or tough restrictions. But <PERSON> Mavundla </PERSON>'s council has helped achieve major reforms in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, the largest city. Hawkers now can obtain licenses in two days, rather than six months, he said, leading to an increase of licensed hawkers from 250 a few years ago to 9,600 now. <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> recently opened its central business district to hawkers after years of exclusion and has created `` free hawking'' zones where traders like <PERSON> Matsegeng </PERSON> can operate. The city has scrapped requirements that hawkers have storage facilities and advertise in newspapers in order to qualify for a license. Now, <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s hawkers can operate as close as 100 yards from a store selling similar goods, in contrast to 400 yards before. They can stay in one place for two hours; before, they had to move every 20 minutes. `` The established business community is our biggest problem,'' <PERSON> Mavundla </PERSON> said in an interview. `` Retailers see hawkers as a threat, a pressure group coming to take their customers away.'' `` They need to see there's a benefit for themselves,'' he added. `` The more competition there is, the more business there will be. We can provide jobs and help the economy grow.'' The council's ultimate aim is give more economic power to blacks and to help poor, uneducated people provide for themselves in a society where 5 million whites dominate 26 million blacks economically as well as politically. `` Economics is going to succeed where politics have failed to find solutions,'' said <PERSON> Mavundla </PERSON>. The council's publicity director, <PERSON> Vicky </PERSON> <PERSON> Sussens </PERSON>, said hawkers are receiving increasing cooperation from wholesalers and manufacturers, even though they fear reprisals from retailers. She added that wholesalers and manufacturers realize their future is selling to blacks. `` There is more respect now. They see hawkers as businessmen, not just someone trying to eke out a living like a beggar.'' Successful hawkers such as Matsegeng can earn 1,200 rand -LRB- $ 500 -RRB- a month, double the wages of a typical black mineworker. Those operating out of houses often earn even more. Police harassment of hawkers has declined but remains a problem, said <PERSON> Mavundla </PERSON>. He said hawkers commonly spend 60 rand -LRB- $ 25 -RRB- a week bribing policemen to avoid fines or confiscation of goods, either of which can wipe out a week's earnings. Government leaders praise the informal sector, `` but they're only saying it for political gain,'' <PERSON> Mavundla </PERSON> said. `` They're not really serious.'' <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Tager </PERSON>, a law professor who has studied the informal sector, says it is flourishing because of restrictions on formal black business development in townships, such as lack of approved sites and bans on using homes as business `` Its existence is evidence that no legislation, however harsh, can totally extinguish the entreprenurial spirit,'' she wrote.

<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ask freshman Rep. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> how he feels about the 51 percent congressional pay raise and he'll tell you to read his lips. Then he'll twist them into contortions defying translation. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, the TV actor-turned-Georgia politician, demonstrated that evasion technique at a black-tie dinner the other night. It was comedy with a message. The 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is in a political and parliamentary maze on pay, an issue that has nagged senators and representatives since the first. While he backed this raise, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that in a perfect world the members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would vote on salaries instead of operating under a system of raises by remote control. That vision of perfection is not widely shared at the Capitol. For 200 years, setting pay has been a headache for members, who fear voter retribution for approving their own raises. For the last 20, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> have sought political shelter in a system designed to spare them votes on their own salaries. Using one of the best-tested of political hedges, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> turned the pay dilemma over to a commission. That usually means getting somebody else to cope with a high-risk issue, preferably somebody who does n't have to run for re-election. That process was supposed to make <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a spectator when salary commissions proposed pay increases for <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the federal courts and the top tier of the executive branch. The president can accept, reject or modify before sending the pay recommendation on to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which gets the raise unless both houses vote no within 30 days. That sounded foolproof. It is n't. It led to intramural bickering at the Capitol, since the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> often has had free, politically-popular votes against pay raises that took effect anyhow for lack of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rejection. That seemed to be happening again, but the game plan came apart in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> because of widespread public opposition to the $ 45,500 raise the commission recommended. Congressional pay is a ready-made issue for an election challenger _ who, if elected, comes to see the need for higher salaries in a new light. That instinct showed when Republicans tried to use `` yet another whopping pay increase'' as a 1989 fundraising issue. But they had to drop it because President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> recommended the raise and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> endorsed it, both coupling support with a ban on the speechmaking fees many members have used to supplement their pay. The pay commission said the increase is needed to restore a 35 percent drop in the spending power of congressional, judicial and top executive branch salaries during the past 20 years. Debate seldom centers on the merits of an increase, although the size of this one has made it particularly vulnerable to voter wrath. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has tried again and again to find a system that would calm the salary issue. There have been proposals to turn the issue over to a permanent, independent panel; even to have the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> set congressional salaries. Nor is there new business in the call for reform as the price of a pay raise. President <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> said his endorsement of a 1977 raise was based on `` a firm commitment to a new code of conduct'' that was to have included a ban on moneymaking speeches. The raise took effect without the ban. One salary commission called the whole business a prolonged adventure in futility. Prolonged indeed. The first <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, in 1789, got $ 6 a day. That was raised to $ 1,500 a year in 1816, stirring a voter rebellion that ousted incumbents including <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>. That led to repeal and an $ 8 daily wage. When the Bill of Rights was proposed, so was a constitutional amendment forbidding any <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from raising its pay until after the next election. It never was ratified. The assumption was that <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would vote on their salaries, and that their constituents would be the final judges. Now the sytem avoids pay votes. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON>, chairman of the salary commission, said that's the way it should be. In advocating a raise without a direct vote, <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer and former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel, said utility infielders who bat .200 are being paid more than judges and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Some are. But they do have to risk going to bat.

 A posh retreat laid out more than 800 years ago for emperors awaits President and Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> when they come to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Feb. 25. The guesthouse has 26 rooms in its two stories and costs $ 20,000 a night for regular guests. An electric massage chair and whirlpool bath is in the main bedroom. The <ORGANIZATION> Diaoyutai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guesthouse </ORGANIZATION> stands almost as a contradiction to the austerity of today's <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` Yes, we are socialist,'' explains <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Guotong </PERSON>, one of the officials who run the place, `` but for heads of state you must have such things.'' President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will stay there when he visits in May. So will Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> when they come in November. The 26-room guesthouse on the complex, simply called No. 18, was remodeled for <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> when she visited <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in 1986. The Chinese government pays the bill for official and state guests such as these, but others have to come up with $ 20,000 a night. <LOCATION> Diaoyutai </LOCATION>, which means `` fishing terrace,'' sits on 100 acres of pine groves where peacocks wander and swans grace a pond. The complex is made up of 15 large guest villas. No. 18 is the most sumptuous. From its gold-plated bathroom fixtures and silk-covered walls to its displays of ancient bronzeware and gold cloisonne, the villa radiates luxury and elitism in a grubby, gray city where egalitarianism so lately was in style. But ideology seems to stop at the gates to <LOCATION> Diaoyutai </LOCATION>. Even during the extreme leftist Cultural Revolution of 1966-76, Chairman <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Qing </PERSON>, relaxed in villa No. 17 by watching Western movies. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s shifting foreign policy can be charted, however, from the guest list. In 1959, when the separate villas were built, most of the guests were communist comrades. Now, Director <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaoliang </PERSON> said, most guests are Americans and Japanese. The Vietnamese revolutionary <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> <PERSON> Chi </PERSON> <PERSON> Minh </PERSON>, Soviet leader <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and Presidents <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> were among the parade of world leaders who stayed at <LOCATION> Diaoyutai </LOCATION>. `` Other hotels in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> may be more convenient _ guests can come and go more freely,'' <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` But we offer quiet and security they ca n't match.'' <LOCATION> Diaoyutai </LOCATION>'s telephone operators are ordered not to connect calls to guests if the caller does n't know their room number. The police who stand at attention at the compound's gates admit only cars whose license plates have been cleared in advance. For the guests, however, almost anything is possible. <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON> tells a story of a guest years ago who wanted water chestnuts during the winter, when they were out of season. The guesthouse sent <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers to a nearby lake to cut through the ice and try to find some, he said `` Now we would n't do that,'' <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON> said. But almost. <LOCATION> Diaoyutai </LOCATION> sends its own trucks to the coast to pick up fresh shrimp and has special ingredients flown in from all over the country. It pays 1,000 yuan -LRB- $ 270 -RRB- a pound for a rare herb necessary for a special scallop soup. `` Hotels wo n't do that,'' <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON> said. With that kind of overhead, rates start surprisingly low at $ 140 a night for a standard room. Presidential suites cost $ 500 a night. But the fanciest villas, No. 12 and No. 18, must be rented in their entirety for $ 20,000 a night. Among other recent users of No. 18 were Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON>, the American industrialist. Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> are booked for Nov. 1. No. 18's presidential suite includes separate his-and-her bedrooms and bathrooms, each thickly carpeted and decorated with costly art works. `` He'' gets the electric massage chair and whirlpool bath. `` She'' gets a sunken tub with brass rails. To help cover its annual 28-million-yuan -LRB- $ 7.5-million -RRB- budget, <LOCATION> Diaoyutai </LOCATION> began selectively accepting non-VIP tourists and businessmen in 1980 and opened a club for locally based foreign businessmen last year. But non-VIPs need connections to get a room reservation. `` People ca n't come in off the street,'' said <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Guotong </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON>'s deputy. The club, with a $ 40,000 membership fee, also is intended only for `` the leading people,'' <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> said. `` If a lot of people come, the air is not so fresh,'' he added, while walking through the deserted exercise room, three-lane bowling alley and billiards room. The indoor swimming pool is only four feet deep _ `` very safe'' for visiting leaders, <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> said. He paused in front of a green felt-covered table used for playing the Chinese tile game of mahjong and pushed back the pieces to reveal a mechanism that automatically lines up tiles for each new game. Mahjong in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is practically synonymous with gambling, which is illegal. Do guests gamble? `` I do n't know,'' <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> said diplomatically.

<HEAD>Guatemalan Priest Presses for Land Reform Despite Dangers</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<UNK>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE ^Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>TIQUISATE, Guatemala (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 His role models are the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, two assassinated civil rights activists. He nearly followed them full circle in September when attackers opened fire on his car, killing his bodyguard-driver and wounding his adopted son. The Rev. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Giron </PERSON>, a 42-year-old Roman Catholic priest, has n't stopped what he's been doing _ pressing for land reform and seeking permission from the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> to run for president of this Central American country. But that does n't mean he is fearless. `` I'm afraid,'' he said. `` Sometimes I think it's better to be a live burro than a dead thoroughbred.'' <PERSON> Giron </PERSON>, a U.S.-educated priest who taught in the slums of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, in the 1960s and marched with <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> in the city's garbage workers strike, continues to pursue land reform even though it can be mortally dangerous to do so. His father and four other relatives were among the estimated 100,000 people killed in political violence during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Local and international human rights groups blame government security forces for the vast majority of the killings. The slaughter of suspected leftists quelled a stubborn, decades-old insurgency, though pockets of guerrilla activity remain. <PERSON> Giron </PERSON> spent 1981-83 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because of threats on his life here. `` In <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, land is the source of power. No land, no power,'' he said in an interview beneath an almond tree next to his church in <LOCATION> Tiquisate </LOCATION>, 55 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Two bodyguards, one with a submachine-gun and the other cradling a shotgun, leaned against the priest's car nearby. <PERSON> Giron </PERSON> had just said Mass for about 200 parishioners, among them eight adolescent girls dressed in white lace and finery for their First Communion. He told them in the homily that his Christian duty, and theirs, included `` denouncing the terrible things going on in this country; that officials are stealing, that the army is killing people.'' He exhorted them to act as yeast in the firgurative bread of society, to contribute to a rising up. <PERSON> Giron </PERSON> has enlivened a political scene already focused on 1990 presidential elections. He said he intends to use the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campesino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> he formed in 1986 as the base for a political party. The party will challenge the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> and rightists who have dominated partisan politics since the return to civilian government in 1986. The peasant organization represents 120,000 people, he said. Ultra-conservatives, who with the armed forces ran the country throughout its modern history, consider <PERSON> Giron </PERSON> a subversive. Some have called for his arrest. `` This country needs a spark to ignite a revolution, and I want to be part of that revolution,'' he said. The priest calculates that 71 percent of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>'s arable land is owned by 1 percent of its population. Others dispute that figure. But there is agreement that land distribution is among the most skewed in the hemisphere, favoring a small group at the expense of poor Indian peasants who make up nearly 60 percent of the population. According to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> USAID </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, enough uncultivated land is available on big estates to provide five-acre plots to each of the estimated 500,000 heads of peasant households with no land at all. Challenging the gentry's hold on land has always been dangerous. President <PERSON> Jacobo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbenz </PERSON> began the country's first and only land reform in the early 1950s and his initiative galvanized rightist opposition. Military officers supported by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> overthrew <PERSON> Arbenz </PERSON> in 1954 and returned all expropriated holdings to their previous owners, among them the U.S.-based <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> USAID </ORGANIZATION> subsequently described <PERSON> Arbenz </PERSON>'s reform plan as `` moderate and progressive'' <PERSON> Giron </PERSON> does not have a detailed plan yet for redistributing land But he describes his philosophy as radical. He envisions a <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> with no landless peasants, a place where country people have enough land to grow the food they need. `` It ca n't be done in one year, or even two, because people have to be educated. But I would make a real revolution here, and they -LRB- the landholders -RRB- know it,'' said <PERSON> Giron </PERSON>. <PERSON> Giron </PERSON>, who supported the successful presidenical candidacy of <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> in the 1985 election, said he has letters from the president in which the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> committed himself to land reform. <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION> has made no such commitment publicly, but he has supported programs to aid small farmers. He also has used government funds to buy about 11,000 acres of land to divide among some 3,000 peasant families. `` All that has been done has been done very timidly,'' said <PERSON> Giron </PERSON>, who with some followers invaded and occupied fallow farmland in 1986. The government bought the parcel and sold it to the peasants at subsidized prices. <PERSON> Giron </PERSON>'s campesino association runs three cooperative farms on such land bought cheaply from the government. He said <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION> probably would have pursued small-scale redistribution had it not been for a coup attempt last May. The military high command backed <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION>'s government and put the rebellion down. But the civilian administration, which had been barely able to assert authority against the military in the best of times, became even more conditioned by and dependent upon military tutelage. `` May was it for <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Giron </PERSON>. Rightists contend that breaking up large holdings would hurt production of hard currency-earning mainstays of the economy _ coffee, sugar, bananas and cotton. `` Even in good export years, people are dying of hunger,'' responds <PERSON> Giron </PERSON>. `` I'm not in favor of destroying the productive apparatus. I'm smart enough to know we ca n't live without dollars. `` But I ca n't go along with a system under which a small group of the privileged live like kings while most people live like beggars.'' Some have suggested <PERSON> Giron </PERSON> harbors a death wish. `` How can they say I want to be martyred?'' he said. `` It's a risk, but it's a risk I'm willing to take. But that does n't mean I want to die. `` What the hell,'' he added, switching from Spanish to the colloquial English he picked up in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>. `` I do n't want to die. I wan na live.''

<HEAD>Few Convictions So Far of Philippines Mutineers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN GUERRERO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Only 52 of 500 or so soldiers accused of trying to overthrow President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government have been convicted so far, despite her vow to punish them to the fullest that the law allows. Military records indicate 108 have been acquitted. Sources close to the Judge Advocate General's Office predict most of the accused will either be acquitted or receive light sentences unless Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> applies pressure on the military justice system. Military courts have charged at least 488 officers and enlisted men with involvement in six coup attempts since Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> took power in an uprising against President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> in February, 1986. No reliable figures are available on the actual number of soldiers involved in the coup attempts, including a mutiny Aug. 28, 1987, when at least 53 people were killed and more than 300 wounded. But military officials say at least 2,000 mutineers took part that last and the most serious attempted coup. Hundreds more were involved in five others. Many lower-ranking enlisted men were quietly released without charge because they were simply following orders. Others escaped, including former Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, who led the mutiny in August, 1987. So far, the stiffest sentence _ 12 years at hard labor _ was given to Col. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Canlas </PERSON>, leader of the takeover of a private television station in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> in January, 1987. Although the sentence called for hard labor, sources close to the military say <PERSON> Canlas </PERSON>, who was convicted last May, is being held in relative comfort _ with access to tennis courts and other amenities _ at a military garrison pending completion of a review of his conviction. In December, 41 soldiers were acquitted of taking part in an attack in April 1987 on <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bonifacio </LOCATION>, headquarters of the Philippine army. The military said they were freed because of lack of witnesses, although sources said prosecutors had sworn statements from witnesses linking most of them to the attack. The acquittals have led to charges in the Philippine press of a military whitewash. In a recent editorial, the independent <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> said the acquittals reflect an `` esprit de corps'' in the military that `` assumes the form of a closed club, the members of which in each other's eyes can do no wrong.'' A Western diplomat with links to the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> military said he suspects the courts will go easy on defendants to avoid worsening factionalism in the 160,000-member armed forces. `` I do n't think anyone will be put up against the wall,'' said the diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` There may be a few who get punished, but I suspect most will get off lightly in the spirit of national reconciliation.'' A military lawyer, also insisting on anonymity, acknowledged that personal ties and the `` brotherhood of arms'' often influence court-martial boards, which are trying the soldiers. `` Before we write our decision on that piece of paper, our conscience asks us, ` Can you live with this? Can you live with the thought that you sentenced a guy to be killed _ a guy in your same uniform and the establishment?''' he said. `` Then my heart tells me _ do this.'' He gave a thumbs up sign for acquittal. In such an atmosphere, military lawyers say it will take pressure from the Aquino administration to overcome widespread sentiment for acquittals or light sentences. Another military lawyer, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said the military justice system had become accustomed to presidential pressure during the 20-year <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> administration. He said that during some major trials in the 1970s, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> himself would monitor proceedings via closed-circuit television and telephone prosecutors with detailed instructions on arguing the cases. `` That's not done now anymore,'' the lawyer said. `` But if they -LRB- in the Aquino government -RRB- want these guys convicted, they will have to orchestrate it. Give us directives.''

<HEAD>`Vino Novello' _ New Wine _ is Boon to Italy's Wine Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FLORENCE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It's `` vino novello'' _ <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s version of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s Beaujolias nouveau _ and it has proved a boon to a wine industry that had been in the doldrums. The `` new wine'' was the idea of <PERSON> Piero </PERSON> <PERSON> Antinori </PERSON>, the nobleman and wine baron, and another producer in 1975 when a flood of low-grade Chianti had customers turning up their noses at the rustic, straw-covered red wine flasks. The two producers came up dressed-up variation of <LOCATION> Chianti </LOCATION> called `` vino novello,'' ready for drinking just about six weeks after harvesting. Today, the wine is booming, with production in 1988 estimated 30 million bottles. The Italian wine industry is looking at novello and other young wines as a way out of the crisis brought on by quality problems, a tainting scandal and declining demand. `` It's been an immense success,'' said <PERSON> Antinori </PERSON>, his gray eyes twinkling, as he sipped a glass of novello in the 16th-century Antinori Palace in <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>. `` I was really surprised.'' <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> is the world's largest wine producer, and its citizens have a long tradition of washing down hearty meals with equally hearty amounts of wine. But in recent years, domestic consumption has plunged _ from 99 quarts per-capita in 1977 to 63 quarts in 1986, according to statistics of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. Officials say a similar drop is occurring throughout the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> as people in busy industrial centers abandon long lunches. `` The basic customs have changed,'' shrugs <PERSON> Ezio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivella </PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Villa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banfi </ORGANIZATION> wines. `` The worker used to do peasant work, ate badly, and drank wine for energy to work. That does n't exist anymore.'' But that's not all. Italians are increasingly gulping soft drinks and beer, or simply cutting back on wine in the interest of their diets. `` I even drank mineral water at lunch today,'' <PERSON> Rivella </PERSON> said. The change in demand has battered Italian winemakers whose incomes are also suffering from a worldwide wine glut and a methanol poisoning scandal in 1986 that crippled Italian exports. In an effort to appeal to a more affluent society, winemakers have come up with a river of new offerings such as novello, fragrant whites, sparkling wines and fruity reds. `` People now want wines that are lighter and fresher,'' says <PERSON> Antonella </PERSON> <PERSON> Abeti </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Novello </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a regulatory body. Even in the land of pasta, she says, `` people just are n't eating heavy anymore.'' Since <PERSON> Antinori </PERSON> and another company, <PERSON> Gaja </PERSON>, began making novello in 1975, 129 other Italian wineries have followed suit _ most in the past two years. Sales of vino novello in 1987, the lastest year for which figures are available, reached $ 19 million, according to the Vicenza Fair of novello producers. An average bottle costs the equivalent of about $ 4 in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Italians have long produced a harvest wine. But until the French introduced sophisticated equipment for fermenting young wines three decades ago, Italian novello was somewhat bitter and did not travel well. It took the publicity-driven success of <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beaujolais </LOCATION> nouveau to persuade the Italians to start mass-producing their own novello. Like Beaujolais nouveau, novello not only is ready to drink in about six weeks, it is made by putting whole grapes into oxygen-free vats, where the fruit releases carbon dioxide that in turn breaks down the grapes to produce a fresh, fragrant wine. But Italian novello is drier and tarter than Beaujolais nouveau because of a greater variety of grapes and the addition of some traditionally fermented wine. `` Vino novello represents an important development,'' said <PERSON> Antinori </PERSON>, whose family has made wine since the 14th century. `` But it's not even so much in income. It has perhaps changed some of the image of young wines. It's also been a help for regions that have had an image problem.'' One of those regions was <LOCATION> Tuscany </LOCATION>, the home of <LOCATION> Chianti </LOCATION>. In the late 1960s and 1970s, the quality of much <LOCATION> Chianti </LOCATION> declined as small grape plots were supplanted by large estates that planted high-yield grapes. Producers hope that the young wines that have helped revive their own image will now open up foreign markets. While still the largest exporter of wine to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other large nations, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> has seen its exports drop from 520 million gallons in 1982 to 312 million gallons in 1987, according to the most recent government figures. Much of the drop stemmed from the methanol scandal, which killed two dozen people. Another factor was the increasing sophistication of consumers who turned away from the inexpensive, fizzy wines <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> traditionally exported. What part novello will play in helping <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> recoup its foreign market is still unclear. It is more expensive than Beaujolais nouveau and there is neither strict government regulation of how the wine is made nor preparations for a major foreign advertising campaign. `` The reality of Italian novello wine is becoming stronger and stronger,'' <PERSON> Antinori </PERSON> said. `` But there's one handicap: novello is an Italian reality. It has n't yet crossed the borders.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ The vast abandoned steelworks around <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> and elsewhere in the Rust Belt are undergoing a metamorphosis, a `` greening of the valley'' as one local planner put it. The grimy mills are being torn down to make way for industrial parks, high-tech centers, and even amusement parks, with local governments putting up much of the money.

 <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION>'s once-mighty <ORGANIZATION> Aliquippa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION>, which hugs the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> for seven miles west of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, finally is being torn down, yard by rusty yard, and union boss <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Vallecorsa </PERSON> is shedding no tears. About 8,000 workers once toiled at the plant, turning limestone, iron ore and coal into <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s pipe, wire and tin plate. Only about 900 workers remain in two small mills that have managed to prove their profitability in the fickle 1980s. But <PERSON> Vallecorsa </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 1211 </ORGANIZATION>, wo n't fight for the old plant. `` Why raise people's hopes? As long as the mill is standing there, rotting away, there's a false sense of hope it is going to start again,'' he says. Along the 80-mile-long steel valley of the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Monongahela </LOCATION> rivers, closed plants are being demolished in preparation for their metamorphosis as industrial parks, high-tech centers and even amusement parks. From <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, large manufacturing plants are undergoing similar transformations. `` It's like the greening of the valley,'' says <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrouk </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're changing from gray to green essentially. We're looking at open space, clean, light industrial development and some heavier activity.'' From 1979 to 1987 more than 67,000 jobs in basic steel and 63,000 jobs in heavy manufacturing were lost in the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> area. Companies closed within days, sometimes overnight, leaving behind eerie, ghost town-like plants where coats still hung on hooks and lunch boxes waited to be opened. While social service agencies tried to help the displaced workers, planners turned their attention to the shuttered plants themselves. In particular, they looked at mills in the <LOCATION> Monongahela </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> south of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, the cradle of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s steel industry. For psychological and economic reasons, they believed the change had to begin there or the valley, so dependent on steel for so many decades, would wither. `` Around the end of the'70s and the early'80s, we were experiencing a major shutdown every week,'' Barrouk says. `` The magnitude was such that it was almost impossible to respond in any way you thought was adequate. `` There were a lot of major facilities in private, corporate hands, and the companies were not interested in being landlords.'' Public and private entrepreneurs with a vision stepped in. Although there's no general, long-term plan for the region, a quiet renaissance in real estate has emerged. Some examples: _ Just six miles from downtown <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s century-old Homestead Works is being turned into a new alloy of light manufacturing plants, offices and a riverfront playground with water slides, a boardwalk and a sandy beach _ Within five minutes of downtown <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, the former J & amp; <ORGANIZATION> L </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Hazelwood </LOCATION> plant is becoming the city's version of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> Bulldozers have cleared the way for the <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a site for developing robots, computer programs and research into biotechnology. _ In <LOCATION> Glassport </LOCATION>, about 10 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, the former <ORGANIZATION> Copperweld </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> wire manufacturing plant is the home of 14 companies producing windows, ball bearings, steel rods and futuristic airbuses _ In neighboring <LOCATION> McKeesport </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Duquesne </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> last year turned its National and <ORGANIZATION> Duquesne </ORGANIZATION> works over to <PERSON> Barrouk </PERSON>'s agency in what is believed to be the nation's largest transfer of industrial property to local governmental agencies for redevelopment At an international conference on urban renewal, a team of experts led by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> descended upon the valley last year to examine ways to revitalize the area. In general, their ideas validated what some private and public developers already had planned or begun. Not everyone has been receptive. Those who believe basic steel can bounce back say demolishing plants such as Homestead is akin to hammering the last nail in the coffin of the nation's old-fashioned, integrated mills and the communities that became dependent on them. `` In many cases, these facilities were horrendously managed,'' says <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Erickson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, which is trying to maintain steelmaking in the <LOCATION> Mon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. With leaner, smaller operations that can respond more quickly to changes in the market, some doomed plants still could be producing steel profitably, <PERSON> Erickson </PERSON> says. In some cases, steel is even being manufactured on a limited scale at plants that are being demolished, such as <LOCATION> Aliquippa </LOCATION>. Others, however, point to study after study that have determined that steelmaking at many of the facilities is no longer feasible. The future for the sites, they say, is to offer a more diverse mix of goods and services. `` We're going to get jobs back,'' Barrouk says. `` But instead of one manufacturer that has a club of influence on a community, we're talking about dozens of manufacturers. <PERSON> Erickson </PERSON> questions whether such sites are truly marketable. `` They're unattractive,'' he says. `` They have high taxes, poor access, bad public service and bad school systems. The locations are n't conducive to light industry or high technology without a lot of work being done.'' <LOCATION> Kelly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, whose company is developing the <ORGANIZATION> Homestead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledges it will take millions of dollars to clean the sites of pollutants and build roads, bridges and sewer and water lines. But he says once the stage is set, there will be plenty of interested actors.

 `` You take 100 acres in the <LOCATION> Mon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and put in sewer and water lines and it will fill up,'' says <PERSON> Park </PERSON>, vice president of the Cleveland-based <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. For the past year, giant shears have been nibbling away at <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnegie </PERSON>'s citadel of steel and smoke in <LOCATION> Homestead </LOCATION>, slowly demolishing the plant that once employed 15,000 and supplied massive amounts of armor plate in World War II The <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which liquidates and recycles industrial property, bought most of the 3 -LCB- - mile-long plant from <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> for more than $ 2.75 million <LOCATION> Kennywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, an amusement park, bought the rest. `` If this development happens as we anticipate, I can imagine streets here with names like Open Hearth Avenue,'' Park says. `` This is going to be a real showplace, with heavy and light manufacturing and some commercial and recreational ventures.'' A brick building that was the site of the bloody 1892 labor dispute pitting <PERSON> Carnegie </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Pinkerton </LOCATION> guards against striking steelworkers _ a battle that set the unionization of steel workers back 50 years _ may be preserved as an historic landmark. A community-based credit union plans to construct a $ 1 million building on a former parking lot. Park also may restart two mills within the plant, and a local investment group is trying to buy part of the plant and produce steel for use in farm equipment, cars and major appliances. At one end of the site, bulldozers are clearing brush and debris and regrading land for the water park, scheduled to open this July. Kennywood President <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> says the park is the brainchild of an associate who felt that <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, nearly 400 miles from the ocean, needed a beach. Not only was the Homestead property available, but it has a gentle slope and offers a view across the river of a densely wooded hillside. `` I think people are going to be astounded when they see this,'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> says. `` It's such a sylvan setting. It's almost impossible to imagine it's an old steel mill.'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> says the park will feature 18 water slides, a boardwalk, wading pool and a channel for floaters _ this in the midst of a rough-and-tumble town known more for its food banks and soup kitchens than recreation. If it's successful, he plans to build a large marina and floating restaurant. A few miles upstream, Glassport's fortunes sank with heavy manufacturing. And in the mid-80s, when the county bought <ORGANIZATION> Copperweld </ORGANIZATION>'s vacant Glassport plant, the economic climate for start-up companies did n't appear too bright. `` When we walked through the plant, it was the eeriest feeling because the papers were still on the desks, jackets were still hung on hooks. Lunch boxes were n't even opened,'' Barrouk says. `` People were given one-day notice when they left that place. It was like a neutron bomb. It was just like walking through a ghost town.'' Using public funds, the county and an incubator group bought the 1-mile-long facility in 1984 for $ 600,000 and spent $ 2.5 million to renovate it. Officials hoped they could find tenants within five years. It took less than two. The site houses 13 companies employing about 200 people, most of whom were hired locally, and the county is considering buying adjacent property. The activity has pumped some life into <LOCATION> Glassport </LOCATION> itself, says <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>, who manages the facility. `` Where the restaurants were closed before, people now have lunch. <ORGANIZATION> Rite-Aid </ORGANIZATION> is putting in a brand new drugstore down the street _ the first new building <LOCATION> Glassport </LOCATION> has seen since <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> was a corporal,'' he says. Heady with <PERSON> Glassport </PERSON>'s success, the county last November bought two landmark steel mills _ <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> McKeesport </LOCATION> and its sister plant, the <ORGANIZATION> Duquesne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION>, across the river. The 360-acre package cost the county $ 3.6 million, which wo n't be paid until the land is redeveloped and sold. Barrouk estimates the cost of redevelopment could reach $ 40 million. In <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Laughlin </LOCATION> steel mill _ once a symbol of the city's grimy past _ is perhaps one of the best examples of the city's clean, new future. In 1983, the city and county bought 52 acres for $ 4 million and, in conjunction with the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, are redeveloping it to make room for the <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a high-tech industrial park. A master plan adopted last year calls for each university o develop a portion within six to seven years. `` We took a calculated gamble,'' says <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> of the city's <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Redevelopment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> says the high cost of developing the land _ more than $ 500,000 an acre _ necessitated public financing. `` There's no private developer in the world that's going to do that,'' he says. `` The only way that can be done is with substantial subsidy.'' <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> is convinced such ventures are necessary for areas like <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Mon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> to prosper into the next century. `` There's a sense of urgency on everyone's part that we have to get started with this economic transformation and prepare for the next century,'' he says. `` We ca n't look back.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ Can cancer cells be altered by chemicals to behave more like normal cells and thus become less lethal? Some researchers think that's a possibility and recent experiments have been encouraging. `` We've got gold here,'' said one, `` if we can mine it appropriately and exploit it.''

 Early experiments with cancer patients are showing tantalizing results for an unusual therapy: Rather than killing cancer cells, it seeks to mature them into less recklesse body. By prodding cancerous cells out of their immature state of wild reproduction and toward a more normal specialized form, the treatment aims to sto denizens of thp the uncontrolled growth that characterizes cancer. Researchers hope that approach will let them attack cancer cells that resist current drugs and reduce the serious side effects of chemotherapy. Big obstacles remain before `` differentiation therapy'' could become part of standard treatment, scientists say. But even observers not involved in the recent human trials in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> say they see reason for hope. `` As a basic idea, it ` sappear Apart from issues of therapy, scientists are looking for help from basic research. Better drugs may result if researchers can define just what signals trigger differentiation in normal and cancerous cells. One target for study is oncogenes, malfunctioning versions of some normal genes, which turn a cell cancerous. Another possibility has been discovered only recently: suppressor genes, or anti-oncogenes, which appear to inhibit the transformation to cancer. International collaborations of scientists and physicians are now studying differentiation factors, and the cooperation should shorten the time needed to develop the potential, says <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, who helps organize annual meetings of differentiation researchers. Despite the unanswered questions, researchers say they believe differentiation drugs may one day play a significant part in the battle against cancer. `` We've got gold here,'' <PERSON> Sartorelli </PERSON> says, `` if we can mine it appropriately and exploit it.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ After his first book about a sensational murder case, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> McGinniss </PERSON> was deluged with letters from people wanting him to look into other killings. Most of the letters he did n't read. But he did read one that led him to write `` Blind Faith.'' For <PERSON> McGinniss </PERSON>, there will be no more books about murders.

 <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> McGinniss </PERSON> says his new book, `` Blind Faith,'' is the last one he will write about a murder case. He's running out of empathy. `` I think my capacity for empathy is over. There is nothing worse than a writer not feeling as sorry as he should for the people who are hurting,'' says <PERSON> McGinniss </PERSON>, author of the best-selling `` Fatal Vision,'' about <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, a Green Beret officer convicted of killing his pregnant wife and two small children. `` Blind Faith'' examines the case of a <LOCATION> Toms </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, insurance salesman, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, deeply in debt from gambling losses and enamored of the town Jezebel. So <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> decides to hire a hit man to kill his wife, `` the beautiful Maria'' as he always called her, collect the $ 1.5 million in life insurance he had bought for her, then convince his three teen-age sons that they, too, could learn to love their new `` mother.'' The book, already bought as a miniseries, is a compelling yarn that involves hints of corruption in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, two imported hit men from <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, forged insurance policies and a town that within 24 hours after the murder turns its back on a pillar of the community, a leader in the country club set, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was just the opposite of the <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> case,'' <PERSON> McGinniss </PERSON> says. `` All of <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>'s friends rallied around, convinced he was innocent.'' The <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> case proved a legal nightmare for <PERSON> McGinniss </PERSON>. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> sued and <PERSON> McGinniss </PERSON> agreed to pay $ 325,000 in an out-of-court settlement. However, following complicated litigation, <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> collected only $ 50,000 for himself, plus $ 92,000 in legal fees. A judge ordered that some of the money should go to the mother of his murdered wife as well as <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>'s mother. <PERSON> McGinniss </PERSON> maintains that he, too, believed the Green Beret innocent until he started to examine the evidence. He then concluded, and let his book reflect, that <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> was indeed the man who wiped out his family. Except for the principals, <PERSON> McGinniss </PERSON> uses pseudonyms in `` Blind Faith'' for the other characters, although the real names are all part of the public record. Considered an ideal couple with three blond sons, the Marshalls were teasingly called <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> and Barbie by their friends. <PERSON> McGinniss </PERSON> says he sort of stumbled onto the book when a <LOCATION> Toms </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> woman, a stranger to him, wrote him a long letter shortly after the murder. `` She had about 90 percent of it right two months after the murder,'' he says. `` The letter was very compelling.'' <PERSON> McGinniss </PERSON> says he does n't know why he even read the letter. After `` Fatal Vision'' went on the air in 1984 as a two-part miniseries, he was deluged with letters from people asking him to write a book about some murder or the other. `` I got hundreds of letters from people whose second cousin was murdered or from someone who was beaten up in a barroom brawl and they wanted me to write a book about it,'' he says. `` I was just throwing them away. `` What first interested me about the <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> case was what kind of a place was this where a guy who had lived there 20 years, this pillar of the community, was automatically presumed guilty by his friends within 24 hours of the murder. `` I was also interested in doing something about the social mores of a town in the'80s, particularly a town that did n't have any kind of distinctive identity. It seemed to be a town transformed by materialism. `` It was also a book about these three boys and how they coped when they learned their mother, truly beloved by them, was dead and then they heard their father is a suspect and then they see him convicted.'' <PERSON> McGinniss </PERSON>' first book, `` The Selling of the President,'' became a best seller 20 years ago when he was 26. The book chronicled how <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> defeated the late <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>. `` The difference between illusion and reality has always been a theme of mine,'' <PERSON> McGinniss </PERSON> says. `` Here the illusion was Good Housekeeping come to life. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> bought that whole ideal, that she was an ornament attached to the husband, that her job was to give them a happy home. For that, she paid with her life.'' For the children _ 13, 16 and 17 at the time of the murder _ it was a fairy-tale life of <ORGANIZATION> Mustangs </ORGANIZATION> and Jeeps, swim meets and country club lunches with Mom and Dad. `` This is not a story about their father,'' <PERSON> McGinniss </PERSON> says. `` I'm not interested in exploring the recesses of his mind like I was with <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> I'm interested in the story of how these kids grappled with the worst sort of shock. There was a monster under their bed and it was their father. And they had to look him in the eye and not blink. It stripped them of every illusion they ever had.'' The youngest boy, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, still does not believe his father is guilty.

 `` When I talked to them <PERSON> John </PERSON> was still desperately clinging like a little boy lost at sea to the only thing he had left,'' <PERSON> McGinniss </PERSON> says. The other two, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roby </PERSON>, believe their father had their mother killed, a mother who put notes in their lunches, always kissed them goodbye, and fixed them pancakes for breakfast even when they got up at 11 a.m.. She was Super Mom They will not answer their father's letters nor speak to him. `` They feel their father is already dead,'' says <PERSON> McGinniss </PERSON>. The father is on death row in <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, awaiting the outcome of appeals. He still proclaims his innocence, clinging to a story that he pulled into a secluded rest stop on the <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parkway </LOCATION> to check on a leaking tire and someone hit him over the head and then shot <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>, leaving two bullet holes so close you could cover them with a 50-cent coin. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> claims he was robbed of his <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> winnings and then staggered onto the highway to get help. The tire, which was slashed after it was parked, showed no evidence of a slow leak and there were brightly lit places within a few miles he could have stopped. Then there was the mistress he planned to marry. He had bought yet another life insurance policy, this one for $ 100,000, that very day. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>'s signature had been forged on various documents to raise cash Prosecutors presented evidence linking him to the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> hired guns. One of them was granted immunity to testify. The other, accused of being the actual shooter, was acquitted by the jury that found <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> guilty. Another man, who acted as go-between during the negotiations, received a life sentence for conspiracy to commit murder. <PERSON> McGinniss </PERSON> hints in the book that the prosecutor's office could have taken another tack which would have involved more people, but he wo n't say much more about it. `` If I wanted to write a book about organized crime in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, I could have, but I think it would have been less interesting than what these boys are going through,'' he says. `` Political corruption is everywhere. What is unique is the situation these three kids find themselves in. Their love has kept them very close even though they all viewed the case differently at first.'' <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> was the first to feel his father was guilty. <PERSON> Roby </PERSON> was next, spurred on by a jail house call in which his father asked him to lie the next day on the witness stand. <PERSON> Roby </PERSON> would not do it. The children received some of the insurance money, as the heirs, and will receive more. <PERSON> Roby </PERSON> is moving to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to help with the miniseries based on the book. `` Although this was another murder, it was completely different from ` Fatal Vision,''' <PERSON> McGinniss </PERSON> says. `` The town of <LOCATION> Toms </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> was sort of a metaphor for the blind faith we all have in the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream. But how thin is that veneer? How much of what passes for social intercourse in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is sheer hypocrisy? <PERSON> Toms </PERSON> <PERSON> River </PERSON> is a good example of this superficialty of cocktail and dinner parties and country clubs where everybody finds it necessary to stay on top. I did n't feel like I was repeating myself.'' <PERSON> McGinniss </PERSON> says his next book will be about Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, the man. He has been negotiating with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, but does not yet know whether <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> will cooperate with him. `` I want to do this because I have no sense of what it must be like to have had this extraordinary life, of being the little brother and having everything handed to you and then become the family spokesman,'' <PERSON> McGinniss </PERSON> says. `` This will not be a book about <LOCATION> Chappaquiddick </LOCATION>. It will be about the man and his life.'' After `` The Selling of the President,'' <PERSON> McGinniss </PERSON> tried his hand at a novel, `` The Dream Team,'' not one of his great successes, but he says he will do another novel some day. He wrote `` Heroes'' in 1975 and lived in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> for one year to write `` Going to Extremes,'' published in 1980. He has also taught fiction and non-fiction writing at <ORGANIZATION> Bennington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> McGinniss </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON>, live in a small town in western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and have two children. He also has three children from a previous marriage. `` Blind Faith'' was selected by <ORGANIZATION> Book-of-the-Month </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and Reader's Digest Condensed Books. Additional subsidiary rights include a seven-figure reprint sale to <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION>, serial rights to `` Rolling Stone'' and `` Ladies' Home Journal,'' and film rights to <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> for a four-hour miniseries.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ There was a time when <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s Cajuns were spanked at school if they spoke French. All that has changed in a resurgence of pride in Cajun culture, a culture that is celebrated in the `` Rendez-Vous Des Cajuns,'' a two-hour program of music and humor that is broadcast live every Saturday night from a restored vaudeville theater. No English is spoken there.

 The foot-stomping and fiddling inside the old <ORGANIZATION> Eunice </ORGANIZATION> vaudeville theater spoke of a packed house for the Cajun version of Prairie Home Companion. They lined up around the block, ignoring a tornado watch and gully-washing rain to purchase tickets for a show where no English was spoken except for brief opening remarks by a uniformed park ranger. For more than a year now, the crowds have been filling the 700-seat Liberty Theater every Saturday night for a live two-hour show broadcast locally, regionally and at several points in the nation on a delayed basis. The music, the humor and the recitations of spicy recipes by guest chefs are in Cajun French, which is based on a language spoken in the 18th century. The Acadians were exiled from <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION> by the British in 1755 and 10 years later many had found their way to the swampy coasts and inland prairies of south <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. Others went to inland <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. `` The tape of this show is being sent to public radio in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>,'' says Mayor <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Joubert </PERSON>, who led a local movement to save the three-story brick Liberty Theater from destruction once it finally closed as a movie house in 1982. Built in 1924, the Liberty was the tiny town's chief window into a world filled with vaudeville comedians, actors, singers and ultimately the movies. <PERSON> Joubert </PERSON>, a retired high school principal and veteran politician, sweet-talked the citizens into buying the building. Next, he used his charms on the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which entered into a joint venture with <PERSON> Eunice </PERSON>. Town residents helped restore the gaudy grandeur of the old theater, tearing down rotted curtains that had covered original ceiling-to-floor murals, one a painted <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> dancing with a tambourine. Moldings were regilded, chandeliers cleaned and floors scrubbed of more than 50 years of accumulated wax and dirt, revealing sparkling green-and-white ceramic-pieced floors. An old organ with wooden pipes, now valued by the <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> at $ 25,000, was found under a pile of debris. The theater is part of the <ORGANIZATION> Jean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lafitte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, which is a series of places scattered around south <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, including the New Orleans French Quarter. Construction was set to begin earlier this month on a $ 3 million Acadian Culture Center, adjacent to the theater. It is scheduled to open sometime next year. The Jean Lafitte National Park chose the Liberty Theater as a site for an interpretive center for the Prairie Cajun culture. The city signed a cooperative agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> which uses the theater for its living history presentations. `` That the city of <LOCATION> Eunice </LOCATION> is now the site for a national park boggles the minds of many of the people in this rural area,'' <PERSON> Joubert </PERSON> says. Also, a state-of-the-art sound system is being installed that will allow larger radio stations to air the program. `` They demand quality sound and we'll have it,'' <PERSON> Joubert </PERSON> says. The heart of the Liberty is the `` Rendez-Vous Des Cajuns,'' which features Cajun bands, from the famous to youngsters just getting started on the traditional sound that was isolated along with the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> heritage until the late 1960s. `` In my generation we were spanked at school if we spoke French,'' recalls <PERSON> Joubert </PERSON>. `` There was a sense of shame in being Cajun. We kept the music to ourselves.'' In less than 20 years, the state has brought back that heritage with a bang, offering French courses in elementary schools with many teachers from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Chefs have traveled the world touting the food. No one represents the new wave of Cajun culture better than Dr. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ancelet </PERSON>, the 37-year-old humorist who hosts the show, boasts <PERSON> Joubert </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ancelet </PERSON> is a specialist in folklore at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> and did his doctoral dissertation on Cajun humor. `` I would die in English because the tone of voice, the melody and the vocal pattern are so important in humor,'' <PERSON> Ancelet </PERSON> says. `` The humor here is not the slick <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> type. It's more earthy and rural. There's a lot of hunting and fishing stories. And here they poke fun at prominent people in the community.'' When the show started in the summer of 1987, <PERSON> Ancelet </PERSON> says he was pleasantly surprised to find that the 20 percent to 25 percent of the audience who did n't speak the language were laughing. `` We'll get someone in from <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> who will nudge the fellow next to him and ask what I said. The Cajun must be interpreting well because the tourist laughs. They'll get into a conversation, get to know each other. There's a twofold victory here. The tourist gets his money's worth. He came down here to see Cajun culture. In the Liberty, he talks with them, dances with them. The Cajun sees that his native knowledge is thereby valued. He feels good about himself.'' <PERSON> Ancelet </PERSON> says he sees the show as an extension of his classroom. `` I call it guerrilla academics. I have the opportunity to talk to 700 people and while they are being entertained I get to slip information to them about who they are, where they came from, why they are the way they are.'' The show stirs some of the younger people, especially musicians, to learn the French language. `` The musicians are learning that it's not just enough to mouth French words,'' <PERSON> Ancelet </PERSON> says. `` They need to understand what the words mean to make the song live.'' A local committee whose members' identities are kept secret to avoid pressure chooses the bands for each show from a long list of applicants. `` The committee tries to encourage new talent and yet bring in the well-known bands from time to time,'' the mayor says. `` We'll never run out of musicians. Until the Liberty Theater opened, the younger generation did n't get much opportunity to hear Cajun music because the bands were performing in nightclubs, he says `` We've been portrayed so many times as a bunch of drunks falling off horses at <LOCATION> Mardi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gras </LOCATION>,'' he says. `` Here's a soft drink and popcorn crowd on Saturday night, a family-oriented crowd enjoying life and the good things we have to offer in <LOCATION> Acadiana </LOCATION>.''

 <PERSON> Vartan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON> is an ebullient Armenian who rejuvenated the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> in a flurry of fund raising. <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> is a 224-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> institution with dwindling donations and an iconoclastic curriculum. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, with an enrollment of 7,000, has a $ 370 million endowment, the lowest among Ivy League colleges. <LOCATION> Massachusett </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, by comparison, has a $ 3 billion endowment. <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON>, who will be inaugurated as <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s 16th president on April 9, is a curly-haired, round-faced workaholic who rescued the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> library from a financial crisis by raising nearly $ 500 million in his seven years there. `` I've always favored the underdog,'' says <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON>, 54. `` <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> has always had to do more with less.'' <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON>, who took over the duties of former president <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Swearer </PERSON> on Jan. 1, has 22 years experience as a teacher and as a provost at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>. But he acknowledges that his fund-raising ability `` was not held against him.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, now in the final year of a three-year fund-raising drive, saw gifts drop from $ 51.3 million in 1986-87 to $ 35.1 million in 1987-88, according to <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbit </PERSON>, vice president for development. While he may become involved in fund-raising, <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON> says his `` primary obligation will be to the academic welfare of the institution.'' `` It's the educational challenge that has brought me here,'' he says. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was one of the first major colleges in the turbulent 1960s to do away with most general requirements. Today, it's one of the last to resist returning to the more traditional program of core courses. <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON>, who holds a doctorate in history and humanities from <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, is concerned with the over-specialization among students at many colleges. He wants college not only to `` give students training, but to give them an education; not just an education but to instill them with culture _ with breadth of scope, so they can adapt in these difficult times to a fast-changing world.'' `` Curriculum is not a frozen document,'' <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON> says. He plans to study records for the full 19 years of the `` new'' curriculum before deciding if he will change its direction. `` <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s success is the flexibility of its curriculum as it enables students to respond to their needs,'' he says. `` This one-dimensional or narrow professionalism reduces people's intellectual curiosity and brings a narrow range `` We must teach people how to cope, not with success alone, but with adversity and failure. Out of failure and adversity there is a lot you learn.'' <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON> knows of both. He left the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> for the library in 1981 after being passed over for the university's presidency A native of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> who was educated in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, he says he missed academia during his time in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` One of the things I missed in the years at the library, I did n't have time to read or write,'' says <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON>, the author of three books. `` One of the tragedies is to sit on the mountain of knowledge and not have time to get to it.'' <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON>, who plans to teach a freshman course so he can set `` an example that teaching and leadership are not mutually exclusive,'' says his first priority will be faculty recruitment, nationally and internationally. `` Two-thirds of the American professors will be retiring in the next 10 years,'' he says. While <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON> will focus on the faculty, his reputation is with the students. A faculty adviser to two dormitories at <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION>, he often dined with the students. He says he hopes to continue that practice at <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. `` I'll be getting to know the students, whether they'd like to know me ...,'' he jokes. Officials on the <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> search committee, which chose <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON> among 200 applicants, looked for a scholar-educator, according to committee head <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, a philosophy professor. `` We wanted to find someone who had experience doing research and a high level of excellence _ and it would n't hurt if they could also raise money and walk on water,'' she says.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ Among the cruelest ironies of AIDS are its innocent victims, inheritors of a fatal, incurable disease, and the scorn of those who fear its contagion. Here is the story of <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>, one of those.

 A lonely yellow stick character, arms outstretched, looks down at 8-year-old <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> from a poster in his kitchen. `` I have AIDS,'' the poster says. `` Please hug me. I ca n't make you sick.'' As if it were <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> speaking. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> suffers from AIDS-related complex, or <ORGANIZATION> ARC </ORGANIZATION>, a disease that often precedes the fatal full-blown acquired immune deficiency syndrome. At school, he was isolated in a trailer next door to the classroom, and his only real friend was a tattered doll named <PERSON> Mick </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>'s story is similar to the plight of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, an AIDS victim shunned at school and forced to leave town. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> is the only student in the school trailer. He has endured a lawsuit and a move from nearby <LOCATION> Granite </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to this tiny, <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> community in search of peace. Phone calls playing funeral music and taunts added to the scorn. Now his mother, <PERSON> Tammie </PERSON>, father, <PERSON> Al </PERSON>, and 10-year-old sister, <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>, are picking up the pieces after a struggle that turned neighbor against neighbor in a battle over <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>'s future. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> weighs only 46 pounds and stands about 4 feet tall. His most striking features are his big brown eyes. A quiet boy, he answers most questions with few words. `` I like good people,'' <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> says. `` I like to go places.'' When he grows up, he says, he wants to be a police officer. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> was born with hemophilia, a condition in which the blood fails to clot properly. He also had stomach problems and a shortened esophagus _ problems that were corrected by surgery. But he underwent hundreds of blood transfusions, and at least one of them involved tainted blood products that brought the deadly AIDS virus into his body. In March 1986, <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> was diagnosed with ARC. That was the beginning. Now the family, its former school district and neighbors wish they had done some things differently. Fearing he would endanger other children, his mother pulled him from kindergarten in <LOCATION> Granite </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and a district tutor taught him at home until November 1987. That's when the <ORGANIZATION> Robertsons </ORGANIZATION> and the school district agreed that <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> should be taught in a special trailer 50 feet from regular classes. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> started school 15 minutes before the other students every day and left 15 minutes later than they did. He was not allowed on the playground. School officials say they told Mrs. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> that <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> probably would be placed in regular classes at the school of 750 in the fall of 1988 because his health had improved. But Mrs. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> contends the district made the offer only after the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, at her request, filed a lawsuit on <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>'s behalf in April. On May 5, a federal judge ordered <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> back into regular classes. But the ruling touched off protests from parents in <LOCATION> Granite </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, a steel town of 36,800 across the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. Angry parents chanted, `` Back to the trailer!'' upon his arrival. <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> <PERSON> Callender </PERSON>, 29, says he got into the fight because of anger and fear for his children's safety. `` I did say some foolish things.'' He also founded an informal group of protesting parents called `` SAVE,'' the Society Against Virus Environment. `` It's a fear of not knowing,'' he says. Mrs. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> says she got up to three telephone calls a day from protesters, threatening her and <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>. People hurled epithets on the street. `` Home had become a war zone, and I felt like I was dying inside,'' she says.

 Her former neighbors insist they never heard anyone harass the <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> family, and they say the family had an unlisted phone number. `` If she would have just kept her mouth shut instead of going and going and going, she would n't have any problem,'' says <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rigsby </PERSON>, 68, a former next-door neighbor of the <ORGANIZATION> Robertsons </ORGANIZATION>. `` She just could n't stay out of the TV and the newspaper and it just made a mess,'' she says. `` I do n't think people should be harassed, but she asked for a lot of this stuff.'' Ms. <PERSON> Rigsby </PERSON>, who lives with her 8-year-old granddaughter, says she would not want her to get near <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>. She opposed his entry into regular classes. `` It's too contagious, and I do n't know enough about it.'' `` Nobody harassed her in this neighborhood,'' says <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, 34, who lived next door to the family for nearly 10 years. `` There was no vigilante group. `` She's trying to write a book and she wants a grand finale about Granite City. I'm glad she's moved because someone else can have all this fun that we had.'' With family permission, the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> printed the phone number. To protest state cuts in funding for hemophiliacs, Mrs. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> contacted two newspapers, including the <PERSON> Post-Dispatch </PERSON>, and the family's life became public record. `` I did not comprehend that it would be this big of an issue,'' says Mrs. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. `` Maybe we made some mistakes. I was doing what was best for my kids.'' <PERSON> Stu </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Granite </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> district's supervisor of special educational programs, described her as `` volatile.'' She often initiated confrontations. But he said he had sympathy for any parent in Mrs. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s situation. He said that the mother of an AIDS child thinks she has special license to say whatever she wants, even characterizing one town as the good guys and the other the bad. Mrs. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> says the family decided to leave <LOCATION> Granite </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> after a man accosted her and hit her on the head with a stick. They moved to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roxana </LOCATION>, a oil refinery town of 2,300 nearby, to the home where <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>'s father, who manages a plastics company, grew up. It was a good move for <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>. `` He just smiles all over,'' says <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Waters </PERSON>, a teacher's aide and registered nurse hired for <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>'s second-grade room at the 375-student <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roxana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` His little eyes just dance; they talk more than he does,'' she says. `` I think he's happy. Just to see him play, like when he gets the right answer, he gets real excited.'' At first, she said, <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> did n't know how to deal with his classmates, because he had had only limited contact with children his age for nearly two years. But they encouraged him and in days he made friends. South <PERSON> Roxana </PERSON> <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stickels </PERSON> calls <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> an `` average second-grader'' in a class of 24. His writing has improved and he seldom misses school, she said. `` I see him every morning with his back pack and a smile on his face.'' But the school lost eight students because of <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>'s attendance. Fear of AIDS again. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>'s mother says her new neighbors are quick to offer support. `` They said, ` We want you to stop running. Make this your home.''' she said. Many of the new neighbors seem knowledgeable about AIDS, which cripples the body's defenses against disease and leaves the victim prey to infections and cancer. It is both incurable and fatal, but can not be spread casually. It can be passed on by contact with infected blood or by sexual contact. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> does n't talk often about his disease, or his experience in <LOCATION> Granite </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, his mother says, although his hurt has spilled over to the family's new life in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roxana </LOCATION>. Once, hurt, he was crying and asked, `` Does n't God know I am sick?'' It has n't been easy for <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>'s sister either. Frustrated and confused, she needed counseling. Now, <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> feels more at home. His kitchen poster ends with the words, `` Love may be the hardest thing to get.''

 The Rev. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuckey </PERSON> takes over his father's television evengelism empire in <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Glory, Glory'' and is soon up to his halo in trouble, just like ... well, some recent headline-makers. But <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, who stars as <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>, insists that the script for the 3 -LCB- - hour musical comedy was written long before <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> became household names `` The script's been around for a while,'' says <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, best-remembered as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Boy </PERSON> on the TV series `` The <ORGANIZATION> Waltons </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` We filmed it last summer in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. It more or less started as an examination of the phenomenon of television evangelism.'' The story originated in 1981 with co-executive producer <PERSON> Bonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Dore </PERSON>, who had worked briefly with evangelist <PERSON> Oral </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> in polishing his broadcasts. `` If I felt the film was taking cheap shots at someone's faith I never would have done it,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> says. At the center, <PERSON> Stuckey </PERSON> is a man of true faith but he's been seduced into straying. He can speak for the importance of spirituality, but all institutions are subject to compromise and corruption.'' The movie, directed by <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> -LRB- `` The Whales of August,'' `` O Lucky Man'' -RRB- will premiere on Sunday. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> is a biblical scholar totally lacking in the star quality his father used to turn his little church into a television empire. He's earnest but dull, and the ratings start to tumble. In desperation, he turns to a down-and-out rock singer who becomes the charismatic Sister <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON>. The ratings and the donations reach unprecedented levels with Sister <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON>. But behind the altar, unknown to <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>, she's leading a life of Sodom and <PERSON> Gamorrah </PERSON>. He's deeply in love with her, and when it comes crashing down he's the candidate for a pillar of salt. <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> stars as Sister <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON>, <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Rekert </PERSON> as an investigative reporter, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitmore </PERSON> as a church elder and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Morse </PERSON> as <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>'s father, the Rev. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuckey </PERSON>. `` When they called me they said the part was for a nice, clean-cut preacher,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> says. `` Some things you do because they're radically different from what you've done before. Some you do because they're familiar. This was familiar, but I liked the way it was written. It's satire without taking cheap shots. `` He compromises himself with this woman, and before he knows it he's trapped in a web of deceit and conspiracy.'' In February, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> goes to the <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stage </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> for `` Peer Gynt.'' He will appear in a new translation of <PERSON> Henrik </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibsen </PERSON>'s seven-hour play, which will be presented over two nights The six-week run will keep him there until May. `` I played ` Hamlet' there in 1987,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> says. `` That's <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s longest play and this is a thousand lines longer than ` Hamlet. Many people consider the play to be <PERSON> Ibsen </PERSON>'s masterpiece.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> spends much of his time teaching classes at colleges across the country. `` And, with any luck, I'll get another TV movie or two,'' he says. `` That's how it works out. I do n't have the most expensive habits. A TV movie will take care of my expenses so I can do theater and teach. Then when I'm at home it's a full-time job for my wife and I to look after four kids.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> left `` The Waltons'' in 1977. The immensely popular series that ran on CBS from 1972-81 was based on <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamner </PERSON>'s reminiscences about his boyhood in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, in 1977 `` I'd love it if we had a reunion show,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> says, `` but only <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> could write it. He's a sly fox with a deliciously wicked sense of humor. He's as much a country bumpkin as <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>.'' As for another series, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> says he would certainly consider it. `` But a series takes up so much of your time it would have to be something I absolutely loved,'' he says. `` I prefer plays, but I'm an actor The material comes first. If it's right I'll go anywhere and work in any medium. `` I have been lucky as an actor. I've always gotten work. I've never had to wait by the phone Too many actors regard the theater as some place you go to stretch, as though it was an aerobics class. Or they say it's their duty to go back, as though it were an obligation like having tea with a maiden aunt. When people see me in a film they see my work. But when they see me on stage they see me work.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> recently observed 30 years as a professional actor. He made his debut in 1958 at the age of 7 in `` Sunrise at <LOCATION> Campobello </LOCATION>.'' He played the youngest of <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s children, <PERSON> John </PERSON>. That same year he made his television debut in `` A Christmas Tree'' for the Hallmark Hall of Fame.

<NOTE>AP Drama Writer</NOTE>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a large, unfinished room on the third floor of a downtown office tower, a stocky, intense man sits on a piano bench and stares at a cardboard stage setting. Three actors work their way through a scene as the man follows their movements. He listens to their voices and checks their reactions to each other. The scene is repeated, again and again. Between repetitions, the observer, shadowed by an interpreter, jumps up and walks over to the makeshift scenery to demonstrate what he wants. Director <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeremin </PERSON>, who does n't speak English, is rehearsing an American cast, which does n't speak Russian, in a hit Soviet play at the <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>. The rehearsal process, which will last four weeks, is slow but cordial. It's theatrical glasnost in the making, a unique cultural collaboration made possible by the thaw in Soviet-American relations. The Hartford Stage experiment occurred after its artistic director <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON> traveled to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> last year to direct a Soviet production of <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s `` Desire Under the Elms'' at <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Pushkin Drama Theater which <PERSON> Yeremin </PERSON> runs. It was a first for an American director. Now <PERSON> Yeremin </PERSON> has returned the favor. The drama he is directing is <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Chervinsky </PERSON>'s `` The Paper Gramophone.'' It is on view at the <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> Stage through March 18. Before the recent liberalization of Soviet life under <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the play could n't have been performed in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in its original version. `` The Paper Gramophone,'' which is set in the Stalinist era of 1948, deals with the awkward romance between a young girl and a naval cadet. <PERSON> Chervinsky </PERSON>'s play was written as a film script in 1980 but never was produced because of its criticism of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. With <PERSON> Yeremin </PERSON>'s help, <PERSON> Chervinsky </PERSON> adapted `` The Paper Gramophone'' for the stage eight years ago. It opened at the Central Academy Theater of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, but was closed quickly by Soviet authorities. Changes were made in script, and the play was allowed to reopen. `` The press was so good that it is still running,'' said <PERSON> Yeremin </PERSON>, speaking through an interpreter. `` The Paper Gramophone'' remains in the repertory of the Central Academy Theater where it is performed several times each month. `` During those years of stagnation, the theater was probably the only place where you could hear a word of truth,'' <PERSON> Yeremin </PERSON> says. For the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> version, <PERSON> Yeremin </PERSON> has rewritten the play again, going back to the original screenplay. He has also made it clearer for American audiences who are n't familiar with the details of Soviet life and politics. <PERSON> Yeremin </PERSON> found some details of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> theater rehearsal and production different, to say the least. One he even found `` painful.'' In the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the artistic director of a theater rules. He chooses the actors from his own company for specific roles. There are no auditions. `` On the one hand, I like auditions a great deal because the director has more choice,'' <PERSON> Yeremin </PERSON> says. `` You can look for what you really need. On the other hand, I think the theater is a family. So there are other considerations _ not just whether the actors fit a given role, but also that you speak the same language, you have the same asthetic and the same creative outlook To me, a production is always an ensemble. In the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, it was easily solved because we have worked together for years.'' That was n't the case in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Yeremin </PERSON> chose two unknowns, <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowd </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Virta </PERSON>, for the romantic leads. He was pleased with the quality of the actors who auditioned and was particularly taken with <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowd </PERSON> and <PERSON> Virta </PERSON> who, the director says, `` looks very Russian.'' During the rehearsal session, the director, the actors, the <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> Stage production team and the theater's dramaturg <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Leaming </PERSON> sit at a long table. Miss <PERSON> Dowd </PERSON>, <PERSON> Virta </PERSON> and a third cast member, <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Chalfant </PERSON>, go over another scene. <PERSON> Yeremin </PERSON> urges <PERSON> Virta </PERSON> to improvise. The actor complies, embellishing a speech by the young man. The director also tells the dramaturge different dialogue is needed to clarify a situation. The script, on this third day of rehearsal, remains very fluid. Although he makes the final decision, <PERSON> Yeremin </PERSON> likes to have input from his actors and, with the author's permission, has them create their own dialogue. `` I think it is very unfortunate that in many instances the actor is turned into nothing but a performer,'' the director says. `` It's as if we are denying the actors the authorship of their creativity. <PERSON> Yeremin </PERSON> has even improvised with the work of one of the world's greatest authors, <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chekhov </PERSON>, adapting his short story, `` Ward Number Six,'' for the stage by allowing actors to improvise for 90 minutes based on specific ideas and topics from the story <PERSON> Yeremin </PERSON> feels `` The Paper Gramophone'' has universal appeal, transcending its Soviet origins, and that's why he chose it for American audiences. `` I found that in the fates of the people who inhabit this play there is much in common with people everywhere,'' he says. `` It is a story of first love, great dreams and the tragic pressure of the time and the breaking through to other spiritual spaces, shall we say. The play is full of humor but next to the comedy, there's tragedy. The idea of an exchange of Soviet and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> directors evolved in 1986 when <PERSON> Yeremin </PERSON> took over the Puskin Theater. He thought it would be interesting to have an <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> play directed by an American. Through an organization called the <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and its director <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Markson </PERSON>, he found <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON>. `` I never thought that Soviet actors could come up with a production in four and a half weeks,'' says <PERSON> Yeremin </PERSON>, referring to <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON>' 1988 production of <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Pushkin </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, directors rehearse a lot longer, <PERSON> Yeremin </PERSON> says. It's an average of six months but sometimes longer, depending on when the director thinks his production is ready for an audience. At the <LOCATION> Pushkin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Theater </LOCATION>, where a season of three or four plays usually runs from about the middle of September until the end of May, <PERSON> Yeremin </PERSON> has just opened a production of `` Possessed'' by <PERSON> Camus </PERSON>, based on the <PERSON> Dostoyevsky </PERSON> novel. When he returns to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, he will continue rehearsals of his next production, `` The Gospel According to <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON>,'' based on several chapters from the <PERSON> Bulgakov </PERSON> novel, `` The Master and <PERSON> Margarita </PERSON>.'' `` I have no hobbies, no other interests,'' the 44-year-old <PERSON> Yeremin </PERSON> says. `` Directing is all that concerns me. Only theater. Everything that does n't have anything to do with theater bores me to tears, except life itself, which is the food of what art is.''

 An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> inventor and wildlife researchers at <ORGANIZATION> Kruger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> say they have achieved a major breakthrough in conservation _ an immunization system that can stop epidemics in free-ranging animals. The breakthrough is the bio-bullet, a vaccine in a biodegradable projectile that can be fired by an air rifle from a helicopter. It has been used for three years to immunize animals ranging from warthogs to elephants against diseases that have nearly wiped out species in the park, a 7,800-square-mile reserve. Anthrax is endemic in the northern part of the park, an area where 200 rare roan antelope roam. Before 1970, when the park began an inoculation program by firing disposable darts at the animals from the air, severe outbreaks had affected most of the herd animals. `` If we have another major outbreak, we have a method now of controlling the epidemic,'' said <PERSON> Valerius </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Vos </PERSON>, head of research at <PERSON> Kruger </PERSON>. `` I consider this a major breakthrough. ... It will be used widely in the future.'' How widely depends to some extent on politics. While <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s wildlife management program is regarded as the best on the continent, its experts seldom visit other African countries where similar problems exist. Black African governments restrict contact with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> because of apartheid, its system of racial separation. `` It's a pity,'' de Vos said. `` The rest of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> needs us and we need them. We've got expertise and we need interaction.'' For instance, the numbers of endangered black rhinos are increasing in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> but declining elsewhere. Due to South African conservation efforts, the white rhino was removed from the endangered category worldwide. Representatives of private wildlife groups sometimes come to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and exchanges take place by mail, but many Western universities wo n't send copies of research papers to <PERSON> Kruger </PERSON>'s scientists <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, the chief predator researcher, made a tape recording of hyena territorial cries and plays it from a jeep at night. `` All the hyena in the area come around to listen and we can count them,'' he said. `` I've sent my tape to <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> and now Kenyan hyenas are listening to South African hyenas.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Vos </PERSON> said the air-rifle that fires the bio-bullet can be locally produced, but not the bullet itself. He worries what sanctions could disrupt the immunization program. There has been talk of banning shipments of four-wheel drive vehicles to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, because they have military potential. `` That's going to affect us,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Vos </PERSON> said. `` I do n't know what we're going to do, but I guess we can keep going with two-wheel drive vehicles.'' In 1973 <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Vos </PERSON> and his team began inoculating large mammals by firing dart-syringes from the air. Disadvantages included large numbers of plastic darts left on the ground, and the time and cost of manufacturing the syringes. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Vos </PERSON> found <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, an inventor from <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bear </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, who had developed the bio-bullet and used it to vaccinate domestic livestock and wild bighorn sheep. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> came to <PERSON> Kruger </PERSON> <PERSON> Park </PERSON> to assist the research, which includingfiring different-sized bullets at varying velocities until the right size and shape were determined. The bullet can be fired rapidly, allowing marksmen to inoculate about 1,500 animals a day with 80 percent accuracy. The material, a cellulose polymer, dissolves inside the animal, releasing the vaccine. Vaccinating 1,500 animals a day with 80 percent accuracy is `` impressive, to say the least. ... That's a lot of animals,'' said <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> LeFranc </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, a branch of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The South African park lends itself to such an effort because it has wide open spaces and concentrations of animals, <PERSON> LeFranc </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The project illustrates the place that South African wildlife researchers have in the forefront of species preservation and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s philosophy about when to let nature take its course and when man should intervene. `` <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has taken a real strong leadership in the preservation and conservation of their wildlife,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Heuschele </PERSON>, an endangered species specialist at the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` Some of their game parks are among the best managed in the world.'' One researcher at <PERSON> Kruger </PERSON> is capturing impala to find a cure for a human-caused stress disease that occurs when antelope are chased for long distances and caught in a net. In the wild, predators chase impalas only for short distances. The main form of research at <LOCATION> Kruger </LOCATION> is surveillance _ taking aerial photos of vegetation, counting animals, taking blood levels of elephants to see if car exhaust affects them. The data is fed into computers to help determine what projects are needed in the park, a fenced area the size of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Roads affect the natural spread of fire, so controlled fires are set deliberately. Fenced animals can not migrate during drought, so dams are built. In the early 1970s, wildebeest rapidly diminished. A new fence around the park had cut off one herd's traditional migration route, and heavy rainfall encouraged long grass, rather than the short grass the wildebeest like. Managers could have set fires to eliminate the tall grass. Instead, they decided to kill off lions and hyenas who preyed on the wildebeest. To prevent the need for such action in the future, <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> and his team spend two weeks at a time following lions, cheetah and leopards, to monitor their eating habits. `` Are they depressing the prey in large numbers or living in harmony with their environment?'' <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> says researchers want to know. Although anthrax and foot-and-mouth disease are natural African diseases, they are controlled because it would take 20 to 30 years for the herds to recover after an endemic. `` Drastic fluctuations in animal populations are part of nature, but we ca n't afford that,'' said de Vos. `` We cull -LRB- shoot -RRB- buffalo and elephant, and sometimes hippo. These are species that can outgrow the system. The rest of the animals are controlled by the system. Drought, predation, disease all act as controls. For the buffalo and elephant the main predator in the past was man. We have taken man out of it, so now we're bringing man back in, in a controlled way.

 Scientists at <ORGANIZATION> Kruger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> are recruiting tourists to help them track, count and conserve the African wild dog, the most endangered large carnivore on the continent. The big-eared dogs have intricately patterned coats, each one distinct enough so individual animals can be identified from photographs. Once scientists know how many wild dogs there are and how they move, they will begin drawing up conservation plans. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and the private <ORGANIZATION> Endangered </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> have started a contest to get tourists to take pictures of the animals and send the prints in with information on location, pack size and number of young. About 1,000 photographs have been entered in the contest, which began in January and runs through July. The first prize is a free trip to a South African national park and the runner-up prizes are photo equipment. `` We could drive through the park for a month and never see one wild dog, but probably every day someone somewhere in the park sees them. They stay close to the road and they are not scared of vehicles,'' said <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, head of predator research at the park. He said he believes there are about 300 in the park, the biggest group in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Others are in <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` They move long distances and seem sometimes to go out of the park. When that happens, they get into trouble,'' said <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>. Since wild dog packs hunt by day and do n't fear humans, they are easy targets for farmers protecting their livestock. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said a farmer whose land borders the park recently shot 20 dogs. `` People have an exaggerated hatred for wild dogs; it's somewhat like the way the wolf is regarded in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said. Wild dogs travel in packs of up to 25 and need to kill three or four impala to feed their members. Only one female and male in each pack breed, with the female producing 10 to 15 pups and all members helping to raise the litter.

<HEAD>Experts Still Not Sure How to Keep Sphinx from Falling Apart</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 After a year of scientific debate, archaeologists still ca n't figure out how to keep the Sphinx from falling apart. It's been almost six months since workmen made emergency repairs and replaced a stone that fell Feb. 7, 1988, from the crouching lion's right shoulder. But the experts ca n't decide what to do next. `` Scholars from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and around the world have given us good advice, but not one has been able to come up with a sure way to save our wonderful Sphinx,'' said <PERSON> Sayed </PERSON> <PERSON> Tawfik </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s top archaeological official. As chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Egyptian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antiquities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Tawfik </PERSON> is caretaker of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s enormous treasurehouse of the past. `` In all the world there's only one Sphinx like this,'' he said. `` We love him and do n't want to do anything to injure him. This is why we have an international panel studying where to go from here.'' The Sphinx, with its wide-eyed stare and smug expression, has undergone the jabs and probes of restorers almost since anonymous artisans sculpted the half-man, half-beast 4,600 years ago at the base of <LOCATION> Giza </LOCATION>'s pyramids plateau. None of the intermittent remedies has been able to stop occasional rock falls. Major falls touch off political uproars in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. A tumbling rock in 1982 cost the job of the antiquities chairman at that time. Last year's rockfall brought the departure of <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadry </PERSON>, pressured out of office because of a vocal and highly public row with his boss, <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON>, the minister of culture. <PERSON> Tawfik </PERSON> was appointed to replace him in December. Such sensitivity illustrates the Sphinx's monumental importance to the Egyptians. Ancient <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> was a cat-worshiping country, and the Sphinx remains a very personal and popular cat. At times mostly buried in desert sand, at times not, the Sphinx has survived into the late 20th century as one of world's best-known relics, although bruised and battered. Nobody knows how or why or when it lost its nose and pharaoh's beard, but they are the most obvious reminders of the unseen stresses at work <PERSON> Tawfik </PERSON> said he believes the ancient stonemasons knew the Sphinx would n't survive as long as the pyramids of <LOCATION> Giza </LOCATION>, which form a backdrop against the horizon. Some of the Sphinx's building blocks are as strong as those of the pyramids, he said, but others, especially in the neck, shoulder and rear haunches, are weaker. `` Perhaps they knew after 4,000 years or so the Sphinx could n't survive any longer,'' said <PERSON> Tawfik </PERSON>, an archaeology professor `` I think the Sphinx is a decoration of <LOCATION> Giza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plateau </LOCATION>, a unique one, not a monument for eternity as were other monuments.'' The first known effort to help the <PERSON> Sphinx </PERSON> was 3,400 years ago. As recorded in stone, the prince who would become Pharaoh Tuthmosis IV followed an order that came to him in a dream during a daytime nap to remove the sand from the Sphinx. He did so and, as promised in the dream, the Sphinx repaid him by arranging for him to usurp the throne of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. Fourteen centuries later, Roman technicians performed emergency restorations at a time when the pyramids and the Sphinx already were drawing tourists from around the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. In modern times, foreign and Egyptian teams have had a go at stopping the decay. Applying mudpacks to remove salt clusters and injecting glue down its throat did n't work. More drastic suggestions like reburying the monument in sand or encasing it in glass arise from time to time. In the year since the stone fell, experts from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries have given advice on how to proceed. Egyptian geologists are studying rock samples. Specialists are monitoring desert winds that blast the Sphinx. Pollution experts are studying the effects of dirty air. Water and soil technicians are testing the water table level on and near <LOCATION> Giza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plateau </LOCATION>, checking whether subterranean water is causing salt to weaken the limestone. Even so, the <LOCATION> Giza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plateau </LOCATION>'s antiquities director, <PERSON> Zahi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawass </PERSON>, remains optimistic. `` I believe for the first time in its history we are able to save the Sphinx,'' <PERSON> Hawass </PERSON> said, explaining that advanced scientific findings in many fields are being applied to archaeological work. But for the Sphinx, he said, time is passing fast. `` He's like a suffering old man who needs an operation. But what kind? When the rock fell -LRB- last year -RRB-, it was kind of a red flag,'' <PERSON> Hawass </PERSON> said. `` At that time the government appointed a committee to decide what to do. We're still meeting.'' And it will continue to meet, he said, until it comes up with a plan that wo n't repeat the earlier restoration efforts that harmed the Sphinx more than they helped.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Physical Evidence,'' ``Mississippi Burning''</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 `` Physical Evidence'': Hollywood in the late 1940s and early'50s offered a series of films in which the hardboiled detective sifted through unsavory characters and wandered a labyrinthine route to uncover the real perpetrator of a heinous crime. The stars were usually <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> or <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchum </PERSON>. The author was often <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> or a Chandler clone. The plots were as interwoven as macrame. In `` The Big Sleep,'' <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION> even accomplished a miracle: a flashback within a flashback within a flashback. `` Physical Evidence'' is an update of that genre, but with a 1989 touch. The real protaganist is a woman lawyer. The Bogart-Powell-Mitchum figure is a defrocked cop so ineffectual that he spends the final shootout flat on his back, wounded. <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> -RRB- is a public defender who resents assignment of all the good cases to male lawyers. She demands a headlined defendant, a suspended police detective -LRB- <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> -RRB- accused of murdering a shady night club owner. Everyone believes <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> did it _ everyone except <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>. She leaps into the investigation, putting herself at peril from the many desperate figures who had good reason to knock off the club owner. She also finds herself torn between the slovenly but appealing <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> and her stockbroker housemate, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> McGinley </PERSON>. You can take your pick of suspects: <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Welsh </PERSON> as a smooth mobster; <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a cop on the take; <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, the deceased man's unmourning son; <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenz </PERSON>, perhaps a blackmail victim. And more. These films are usually more fun in the playing than in the payoff, and `` Physical Evidence'' is no exception. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>' script provides a climactic body count of six and no great surprises <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Crichton </PERSON>, generally associated with science fiction -LRB- `` Westworld,'' `` Coma'' -RRB-, directed the film with a fast pace and an eye for offbeat characters. Some of his observations are wry, particularly the yuppie lifestyle of <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> and <PERSON> McGinley </PERSON>. The opening sequence is a corker: a would-be suicide ends up dangling from a bridge with a corpse in his hands. Unfortunately, that is the most exciting part of the movie. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> has admitted that `` Physical Evidence'' represents a change of character for him; he plays a not too lovable ex-cop who has lost control of his life and his destiny. He pulls it off in good style, retaining the cynical wisecracks while exhibiting more character than he has since `` Deliverance.'' <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, impressive as the husband killer in `` Black Widow,'' remains totally in charge of her role as the dedicated lawyer. <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Beatty </PERSON> plays the devious prosecutor in his usual style, and the rest of the cast offer an intriguing gallery of no-goods. The <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> release was produced by <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ransohoff </PERSON> and is enhanced by a <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mancini </PERSON> score. The rating is R for language and violence. Running time: 99 minutes. _ By <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Mississippi Burning'': In the summer of 1964, young men and women from around the nation poured into <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> to take part in `` Freedom Summer,'' a concerted effort to register black voters in the segregated state. One was 20-year-old <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, a student at <ORGANIZATION> Queens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. On June 21, <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> and two members of CORE -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equality </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>, drove to the town of <LOCATION> Lawndale </LOCATION> where a black church had been burned. They never returned. They were stopped for speeding near <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and jailed for several hours on bogus charges. After being released that night, the workers failed to call in. After an extensive search, involving the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and 200 sailors, and a tip from a `` Mr. X,'' the bodies were discovered Aug. 4 on a farm outside of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. A fictionalized account of the murder of those three young volunteers is unraveled in <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s `` Mississippi Burning.'' The movie is by no means an accurate or riveting account of that strange and horrendous period in American history. Rather, it is a detective story that boils down to the typical Hollywood good cop-bad cop treatment. It is male bonding redux. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> focuses on two <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents sent to <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> to investigate the disappearance of the civil rights workers.

 `` Horse Feathers'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> Home Video. VHS-Beta, $ 29.95. No Rating -RRB- Even in this era of glasnost, `` Horse Feathers'' proves that <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> still reigns supreme: <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> a la <PERSON> Groucho </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harpo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chico </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zeppo </PERSON>. Marxism according to <PERSON> Minnie </PERSON>'s Boys was always more akin to anarchism, of course, starting with the title of this 1932 classic which naturally bears no relationship whatsoever to the film's goings-on `` Horse Feathers'' takes us to <ORGANIZATION> Huxley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, a school so desperate for a winning football season that it names Professor <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagstaff </PERSON> as its president. The good professor, played by <PERSON> Groucho </PERSON>, quickly spells out his program for the school's revival in one of the funniest musical bits ever filmed: `` I do n't know what they have to say, `` It makes no difference anyway, `` Whatever it is, I'm against it! `` No matter what it is or who commenc'd it, `` I'm against it!'' As with all <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> <PERSON> Brothers </PERSON> movies, it gives away nothing to say that insanity prevails, <PERSON> Huxley </PERSON> whips the bad guys on the football field and <PERSON> Groucho </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harpo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chico </PERSON> commit trigamy with the campus femme fatale known as `` the college widow.'' For trivia collectors, said widow is played by <PERSON> Thelma </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, a comedian who in real life died a violent underworld-related death three years after this movie was made. With the madcap S.J. <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON> as scriptwriter along with <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalmer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON>, `` Horse Feathers'' was destined to be one of the funniest <ORGANIZATION> Marx </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> films, which is to say, one of the funniest by anyone at anytime. It easily ranks with the <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>'s `` Monkey Business'' and `` Duck Soup. <PERSON> Groucho </PERSON>, always at the center of the antics, is perhaps a little nastier than usual and that's just how we like it. Watch his scene in the canoe, for example, wooeing the comely <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> with his guitar. Enough said. `` Horse Feathers'' is 69 minutes of non-stop hilarity. _ By <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitgang </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Slipping Into Darkness'' -LRB- Virgin Vision. VHS-Beta, $ 79.95. Rated R -RRB- This movie is so bad there is n't a funny way to review it. And there's something scary, too. Read the box: `` Three bored college girls are looking for excitement in a one-horse town when a careless joyride ends in the gruesome death of a young boy. Because no one admits responsibility, the boy's brother swears to solve the crime.'' Right. You get this odious piece of anti-female trash thinking, `` Well, hey, it looks schlocky and stupid but at least I'll see shock horror beach party sex biker bimbos on parade.'' And pasteboard characters, ludicrous situations and unrealistic behavior that's kind of a savage `` Carry On ...'' movie. This utterly mean, nasty, hateful movie reeks with contempt for women and sullen hatred for men. The objects of its sexual violence are stupid or perverse women and the objects of its mutilating butchery are men. Then you find out that a woman, <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaver </PERSON>, wrote and directed it. This movie is pornography without the dignity of honest exercise. _ By <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer

 `` Reach For The Sky'' -LRB- <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> -RRB- _ <PERSON> Ratt </PERSON> `` Quiet Riot'' -LRB- <PERSON> Pasha </PERSON> -RRB- _ Quiet Riot Why is it that guys in heavy metal bands always have permed hair? Maybe it's the decibels of sound they crank out of their guitars, or maybe it's just to get a little variety in their lives. Because there sure is n't much variety in the music. Of these two heavy metal bands, <PERSON> Ratt </PERSON>'s effort is the more imaginative _ the band actually uses horns and a harmonica on one bluesy tune, `` Way Cool Jr.'' And Quiet Riot, with a revamped lineup, is the more pop-oriented; `` I'm Fallin''' is actually kind of bouncy. But otherwise, the music and lyrics follow the well-worn, tyrannosaurus-like heavy metal footsteps on both `` Reach for the Sky'' and `` Quiet Riot.'' There's the loud, foursquare thump-thump-thump-thump of the bass and drums, the themes of sex, domination, misogyny, partyin' and wonderin' why that evil woman up and left. There's the guitar solos _ always guitar solos _ reaching ever new levels of speed and showing off the soloist's digital dexterity. And the high, scratchy vocals from the stud-lead singers over it all. No deviation is allowed from the heavy metal form, and <PERSON> Ratt </PERSON> and Quiet Riot do n't dare take a chance. While they sing about being the `` King of the Hill'' -LRB- Quiet Riot -RRB-, or lay down the law on `` Bottom Line'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Ratt </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, they remain shackled to the limits of their music.

<TEXT>
 In her first two American films, Italian-born <PERSON> Valeria </PERSON> <PERSON> Golino </PERSON> has had a dizzying contrast of lovers: Pee-wee <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruise </PERSON>. First came `` Pee-wee's <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Top </ORGANIZATION>,'' in which she played the circus aerialist who wins the heart of the little guy in the tight suit. The comedy did n't exactly overload the nation's box offices, but her next film did. In `` Rain Man,'' the season's reigning box-office champ, she is <PERSON> Cruise </PERSON>'s secretary and bedmate. <PERSON> Golino </PERSON>, 22, is unexpectedly modest about her work in `` Rain Man.'' `` I am proud to be in the movie, but I am not in it very much,'' the dark beauty said. `` But that is good. The relation is between the two of them -LRB- Cruise and <PERSON> Dustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> -RRB-. That's what the movie is about: the relationship of two brothers. If I was there all the time, I would have been in an awkward position. Or I would have had to be arguing with -LRB- Cruise -RRB- all the time. So I had to leave.'' <PERSON> Golino </PERSON> worked in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> scenes, as well as the locations in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, but she missed the middle portion in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. `` There was something about <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> that I liked: the people, the architecture,'' she commented. `` Las Vegas? It was fun, but two weeks and a half in <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON>'s Palace was too much. There is something about the sound that gets you. You go in the rooms and you're like in a cage. There are things on the windows to keep people from jumping out. But you can have fun.'' <PERSON> Valeria </PERSON> <PERSON> Golino </PERSON>'s ascent to stardom appears to have resulted from a series of happy accidents. `` I started as a model in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> when I was 14 -LCB- or 15,'' she said. `` I was not planning to be an actress. Then I met -LRB- director -RRB- <PERSON> Lina </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertmuller </PERSON>, and she said, ` You are going to be in this movie.' It was not an easy thing for me. To work with someone like <PERSON> Lina </PERSON>, who is a wild woman, for the first time, it was kind of shocking. `` I said, ` I thought this was glamour, and this is hell!' She was very tough to me. She is very affectionate, also very severe. But after the first movie, I decided this was what I wanted to do.'' She appeared in 11 Italian films, earning the <ORGANIZATION> Venice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>'s Golden Lion for `` Love Story.'' The producers of `` Big Top Pee-wee'' saw one of her films and brought her to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> for a screen test. `` When I came here, I did n't know who Pee-wee <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> was or <PERSON> Randal </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleiser </PERSON>, the director,'' she recalled. `` In the beginning I did n't want to do the movie; I had never done comedy before. `` Then I saw Pee-wee's first movie, and there was something about him that made me say, ` I can do this.' There was something about the way he moved, his character, that was so different, so original. I said, ` That's not going to be `` Police Academy.'' It's going to be a comedy.''' How did she land `` Rain Man''? `` In the most traditional way possible. My agent called me and said, ` There is a movie with <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruise </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>.' I said, ` What?' He said, ` The role is written for an American girl. Now they're not sure. Let's give it a try.''' The actress made a good impression on the casting director. She read scenes twice for the director, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON>, then with <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruise </PERSON>. Having finished `` Big Top Pee-wee,'' she flew home to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, then was asked to return to read once more with <PERSON> Cruise </PERSON>, then with <PERSON> Cruise </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>. `` I've never done so much reading for such a small role,'' she said. The script was rewritten to accommodate her accent; since Cruise imported Italian cars, she could logically be his secretary-interpreter. How was working with <PERSON> Cruise </PERSON>? `` It was much more interesting than I imagined,'' she said. `` For the first moment I met him, I understood that this guy was great. He was n't like anything I thought before. Always we have big prejudice when someone has big success: He must be an unbearable human being. So I found myself in front of a nice _ in the most full meaning of the word _ really nice guy, a gentleman.'' And <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>? `` Unfortunately, the only thing I got to work with him on was in the elevator -LRB- where she tries to teach him to dance -RRB-. It was a delicate scene to do because it could have looked very easily like seduction. It was a naive way of trying to make him happy because his date had n't arrived. `` <PERSON> Dustin </PERSON>, like <PERSON> DeNiro </PERSON>, is one of the totems of films. Even though I had a small role, it was worth it to be around him to see how he moved, how he reacted. To me it was like going to acting school.'' <PERSON> Golino </PERSON>, who speaks English as well as Greek, French and her native Italian, recently completed `` Torrents of Spring'' with <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>. Even though she is now in demand, she does n't plan to settle in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. `` I like to work here, but I would n't want to live here,'' she said. `` I always want to know I can go home to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.''

<TEXT>
 Austrian composer <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON> was plagued by depression, self-pity and writer's block as a young man, according to <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON> letters recently acquired by <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Letters by German composer <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendelssohn </PERSON>, also part of the new collection, show he could n't handle money, but was a family man who wrote glowing descriptions of his wife nursing their son. Some of the letters have never been published. `` They will now enlighten several aspects of the composers' lives,'' said <PERSON> Iaacov </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghelman </PERSON>, head of the university's music department. In addition to 67 letters by <PERSON> Mendelssohn </PERSON> and 46 by <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON>, the correspondence also includes communications from <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Offenbach </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, <PERSON> Giacomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyerbeer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Halevy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoenberg </PERSON>. The letters were donated by the widow of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> collector <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Lobbenberg </PERSON>. The letters written by the young <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON>, who was born July 7, 1860 as the son of a Jewish peddler in Austrian <LOCATION> Bohemia </LOCATION>, reveal a man in emotional turmoil. Writing to <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Krisper </PERSON>, a friend from composing class at the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> Conservatory, the 19-year-old <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON> described in a Feb. 14, 1880, letter how he procrastinated instead of composing. `` I spent most of my time to indulge in sweet suffering in the most wasteful way. ... I lived in my dreams and dreamt while awake,'' <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON> wrote, adding later: `` I'll have to taste all the sorrows of this world, and wo n't be spared a single one.'' <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON>'s letters to <PERSON> Krisper </PERSON>, most written in the spring of 1880, are filled with yearning for the absent friend. Sitting in their old haunt, <ORGANIZATION> Vienna </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cafe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON> wrote an undated letter on cafe stationary: `` I just arrived in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and immediately went to the place where we shared so much suffering and joy. My thoughts only revolve around you.'' On March 14, 1880, he wrote to <PERSON> Krisper </PERSON>: `` I'm so lonely, and I do n't know how much longer I will be able to bear it.'' <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON>'s early years were also marked by restlessness. `` I've been in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> for three months, and in addition to various hotels, have already lived in five apartments You can imagine what that does to my work,'' <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON> wrote to <PERSON> Krisper </PERSON> in January 1883. `` Again, the crying of some little kid is bothering me,'' <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON> wrote of his abode at the time, adding that despite the distractions, he had completed the first act of `` Ruebezahl,'' an opera for which he composed some music in the 1880s. <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON> initially made his name not as a composer, but as a conductor, leading orchestras in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. In between conducting, he composed nine symphonies -LRB- the 10th unfinished -RRB- as well as several songs and song cycles. The letters of <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON> in later years contained in the collection focus more on business than on his personal life as he arranged concerts, hired artists and quarreled with theater directors. But in a Dec. 9, 1893, letter to <PERSON> Natalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer-Lechner </PERSON>, a friend, <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON> expressed deep concern for his younger brother, <PERSON> Otto </PERSON>, whom he supported financially and tried to advance as a musician. `` <PERSON> Dear </PERSON> <PERSON> Natalie </PERSON>,'' wrote <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON>, the second of 14 children and the oldest of six to survive childhood. `` Today I received a letter from Otto in which, with his usual grandeur, he told me with dignity that I insulted him, and that he could no longer accept my support.'' <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Natalie </PERSON> to find out discreetly whether <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> would manage. `` I ca n't very well answer him since this is the way he feels, but I do n't want him to go hungry or suffer,'' <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> committed suicide two years later in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. The climax of <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON>'s career came in 1897 when he was named conductor of the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> Court Opera. He was baptized a Catholic just before the appointment because at the time non-Catholics were barred from holding important official positions. In his letters, <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON> made no reference to either religion, suggesting that the conversion for him was just a formality. <PERSON> Mendelssohn </PERSON>, a member of an illustrious German Jewish family, was baptized as a 7-year-old in 1816, along with his three siblings. His parents converted to Christianity six years later. As an outward sign of conversion, the family added the surname Bartholdy which, according to music publications, was that of the owners of a garden site purchased by a <ORGANIZATION> Mendelssohn </ORGANIZATION>'s uncle. When <PERSON> Mendelssohn </PERSON> gave a series of concerts in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in 1829, he got in trouble with his father because concert flyers only referred to him as <PERSON> Mendelssohn </PERSON>. Apparently his father, <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>, was anxious that the original surname by itself sounded too Jewish and he suggested at one time to his son that it be dropped altogether. The younger <PERSON> Mendelssohn </PERSON> responded in a letter dated July 16, 1829 that his English sponsors had promised to print the full name, <PERSON> Mendelssohn-Bartholdy </PERSON>, but then reneged. `` I'm convinced it was n't my fault,'' he wrote. `` I wo n't ignore your orders, but I certainly did n't do it on purpose.'' <PERSON> Mendelssohn </PERSON> described how after his arrival in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> he was touted in a local magazine as the grandson of <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendelssohn </PERSON>, the famous philospher of the Englightenment. `` From this moment, all the musicians called me <PERSON> Mendelssohn </PERSON>, and asked me about my grandfather and his works,'' he wrote. `` The people I met asked me about him and said nice things about him.'' While proud of his family heritage, <ORGANIZATION> Mendelssohn </ORGANIZATION>'s new religion also found an expression both in his work and private life. He wrote choral music and six organ sonatas, and in one undated letter expressed his appreciation for spiritual music, praising a choir concert he attended in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The performance `` recalled to me the effect of chorals when sung by the whole congregation and in a crowded church,'' he wrote. `` Being so free from any harshness of tone and shrieking sound, -LRB- something -RRB- one should not expect from such a mass of voices.'' In another letter, <PERSON> Mendelssohn </PERSON> asked an unnamed friend to be godfather to one of his sons, showing he apparently accepted his baptism as permanent. Several of the letters show <PERSON> Mendelssohn </PERSON> as a loving father and husband who took his family responsibilities seriously. On Feb. 2, 1838, one day before his 29th birthday, <PERSON> Mendelssohn </PERSON> wrote to German diplomat <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Klingemann </PERSON>, a friend since the 1820s, to express his joy at the birth of a son. `` I wanted to tell you how I feel when my little son cries, and when <PERSON> Cecile </PERSON> holds him to her breast and looks at him calmly ... and she is so healthy and charming and good like an angel,'' he wrote. The obligations of fatherhood sparked a burst of creative energy in <ORGANIZATION> Mendelssohn </ORGANIZATION>, a prodigy who composed one of his most famous works, the overture to `` A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' at age 17. `` I'm in the middle of writing -LRB- composing -RRB-, and I have to be industrious in these years to get ahead. I have obligations and also the desire to do it,'' <PERSON> Mendelssohn </PERSON> wrote to <PERSON> Klingemann </PERSON>. `` I could finish a new oratorium in one year.''

 <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> had completed recording sessions in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> for his second solo album but felt something was missing. Seeking inspiration, he and producer <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> headed for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The result was `` My Perogative,'' a No. 1 smash off the million-selling `` Do n't Be Cruel.'' `` I felt my album was lacking a strong, aggressive song and I thought, ` Where better than <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to come up with it,''' said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, an original member of New Edition, one of the hottest groups of the 1980s. `` A lot of things had been said about <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, why was he doing this -LRB- a solo career -RRB-. It's my way of expressing to people it's your perogative to do as you want but make sure what you do is the right thing. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> has erased any doubts about his decision to leave New Edition in 1987. Although he had originally planned to return to the group after one album, the success of `` Do n't Be Cruel'' and his first solo record, `` King of Stage,'' have established him as a major star in his own right. `` None of these songs could have come by New Edition,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` I wanted to express more of me.

They began singing together in 1981 when <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was just 13, and made their debut in a matinee performance at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s High Hat club `` We sang a Jackson Five number,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> recalled. `` It was the start of something big. We enjoyed performing together and we used to go around to the matinee clubs. We were the ones out of the neighborthood who took the time to try and do something better for ourselves. The Jackson Five would loom large in the early days of New Edition. Not only were they both five-man vocal groups barely into their teens, but New Edition's breakthrough hit in 1983, `` Candy Girl,'' had an uncanny resemblance to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 5 songs such as `` ABC'' and `` The Love You Save.'' The groups had something else in common: fans, devoted ones. `` In one town, it got totally out of hand and we all ended up in the hospital,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` We were going to the show and when our car pulled up a gentleman we thought was with the organizers told us to go through this door. `` But it was the wrong door. The audience turned around and saw us and they started chasing us. We were terrified.'' There were further hit records and sold-out shows, but New Edition would run into legal problems when producer <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> filed suit, claiming he had legal rights to the group's name. Although a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> judge ruled in New Edition's favor, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> decided in 1987 to go out on his own. `` It was time for a direction change,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` I loved the group and we will be friends forever but I would catch myself going into my own thing at times on stage. I have a real energetic type of personality. They were going for all-American boys so to speak. I wanted to express more to my audience.'' But <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> admitted that the decision took its toll emotionally. `` Yeah, it was tough. It took a lot of going over, a lot of getting used to. It was n't an easy decision by no means. They took it as well as could be expected. We left in good standing.'' His first solo album came out in 1987 and contained the single, `` Girl Friend,'' which topped the R & amp; B charts. But on stage, at least, some adjusting was necessary. `` I went on a tour with Ready for the World. I got up there and I was going through a New Edition song like ` Mr. <PERSON> Telephone </PERSON> <PERSON> Man </PERSON>' and I would start anticipating that <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> would come in for his part,'' he said. `` It did n't take me a real long time to get over that feeling.'' `` Do n't Be Cruel,'' a mixture of uptempo tracks and ballads, has established <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> as a major crossover artist at a time, ironically, that New Edition's latest album is also topping the charts. The singer's desire to let people see the `` real'' <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was tested by the title track. `` The people in the studio had seen a girl I had brought to the rehearsals,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` They got a feeling that she was being cruel to me. The song was devised around that. I knew it was a good tune.'' But <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> did n't anticipate the song reaching the Top 5 or the album becoming one of the year's biggest sellers. The singer called it a `` pleasant surprise.'' `` To tell you the truth, I was hoping for a single platinum. That would have been a feat that I would have loved to have attained. Now being multi-platinum is inconceivable. I'm still overwhelmed at the numbers.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Bharati Mukherjee Speaks for America's New Immigrants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENEVA COLLINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 They are not the tired, poor, huddled masses yearning to breathe free. They are Oxford-educated professors from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, wealthy families chased from <PERSON> Idi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amin </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>, factory owners fleeing <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s upheavals. They are <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s new immigrants, arriving via Concorde, not a refugee boat. They have found a voice in <PERSON> Bharati </PERSON> <PERSON> Mukherjee </PERSON>, a self-described Hindu Bengali Brahmin who was raised in affluence in <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, educated in British and Swiss schools before receiving a master's and doctorate at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION>, and who last year became an American citizen In January, her sixth book, `` The Middleman and Other Stories'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Grove </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, $ 15.95 -RRB-, won the prestigious National Book Critics Circle Award. The honor has been gratifying for two reasons, she said in a recent interview. First, it has put the book, published last spring, back on the shelves. But far more importantly, she said, it has shown a `` marvelous curiosity and adventurousness'' on the part of the literary establishment to select such an unconventional book. `` A country that allows a writer from a minority community or a marginalized group to be included as a voice in mainstream American literature _ now that's a tribute to the country,'' said <PERSON> Mukherjee </PERSON>, a slight, thoughtful woman with a relaxed laugh and exquisite poise during the interview at The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> offices. She was asked if she chose the title `` The Middleman'' because immigrants are, in effect, middlemen _ shuttling between their native and adopted countries. `` Immigrants are middlemen, and I also feel that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is going through transition, that the country has changed since the 1970s with the fast influx of immigrants from non-traditional countries,'' she said. `` We are in many ways similar to the European, and especially the Jewish, influx of 30 to 40 years ago. But in many significant ways, we who are coming from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> are very dissimilar, very distinct. ... `` For many of my characters, as it was for me, coming to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is a social comedown. I had a life of ease and privilege which I have chosen to not to want to continue by living in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ a social demotion. I'll never have that kind of money and physical comfort in this country.'' <PERSON> Mukherjee </PERSON>, 48, who has lived in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> for 28 years, has wholeheartedly embraced the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. She said she thinks of this collection of short stories as `` my tribute to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. This is finally my very <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> book, and I want the exuberance to reflect the kind of exuberance that this country has released in me that none of the countries I have lived in have.'' While studying at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mukherjee </PERSON> met and married <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaise </PERSON>, a novelist, and the two moved to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in 1968 to teach and write. They both became Canadian citizens, but left that country in the late'70s because of racial prejudice and physical harassment of foreigners there. The couple came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and now live in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Mukherjee </PERSON> teaches full-time at <ORGANIZATION> Queens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and part-time at <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> universities. She has written two novels, `` The Tiger's Daughter'' and `` Wife,'' and a previous collection of short stories, `` Darkness.'' She also has collaborated on two non-fiction books with her husband, `` Days and Nights in <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>'' and `` The Sorrow and the Terror.'' The latter is about the 1985 <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> flight that crashed over <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, killing 329 people. `` The Middleman'' is a departure for her because she now feels comfortable adopting the persona of white Americans when needed. In fact, this collection's power lies in the enormous range of characters and locales so convincingly portrayed _ a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> vet who becomes a hired killer in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> woman who sneaks into <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and finds work as an au pair, a Sri Lankan high school teacher who gets stranded in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, a young woman from a close Italian family trying to introduce her Afghan lover to her blue-collar parents. `` When I'm with Ro I feel I am looking at <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> through the wrong end of a telescope,'' thinks the woman with the Afghan lover in the story `` Orbiting.'' `` He makes it sound like a police state, with sudden raids, papers, detention centers, deportations, and torture and death waiting in the wings.'' Other characters see <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as <ORGANIZATION> Disneyland </ORGANIZATION>, a nation of infinite plenty where adults act like overfed children. <PERSON> Mukherjee </PERSON> said she is not surprised at Americans' ignorance of events and geography beyond their borders. `` I remember as a kid in <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>, where we had to know street names in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> ... because real life was lived elsewhere, and whatever life we lived was somewhat devalued by colonialism and post-colonialism. I envied Americans their insularity.'' <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will learn about the rest of the world when geopolitical events force it to, she predicted. And perhaps the literary world's recognition of `` The Middleman'' is a small step toward increasing understanding of this new and different generation of immigrants `` The people I'm writing about have had no voice in American literature,'' she said. `` And I think one of my tasks becomes sensitizing editors of magazines, saying, ` Look, we all exist out there. The people you sit next to on the No. 7 train have enormous stories to tell.'''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Hank Williams Jr. And Father Team Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a rare contemplative moment for country music thunderbolt <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, he paused in his west <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> office and stared at the picture of his parents. He winked at his mother, then fixed his admiring gaze on his dad. `` Well,'' he said to the large photo showing his famous father. `` It looks like I've got a new singing partner and you're No. 1 again.'' <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, a country music legend who died in 1953, and <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> are finally a duet. Through the magic of technology, they sing together on the current song `` There's a Tear in My Beer.'' The previously unreleased song by the elder <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was recently discovered, improved technologically and vocals by his 39-year-old son were added. The result is one of the most anticipated country music releases in years. `` It's a wonderful feeling to be singing along with him _ something I never thought possible,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said in an interview. `` To me, you are looking at two rockabilly stars that finally got together for one hot shot. It's just a very contented feeling.'' That's an apt description of <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' entire career these days. He's country music's No. 1 act right now, having been voted entertainer of the year two straight times by the <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. He has a whopping five albums on the country music charts, including his `` Greatest Hits, Vol. 1,'' which has sold 2 million copies. His concerts _ 2 -LCB- hour marathons _ have set attendance records in several cities. Agents have said he commands up to $ 100,000 per show. His music reveals him to be an enduring explorer singing blues, hard-core country and rock' n' roll. His concerts tingle with fury as he charges around stage, singing his blue-collar anthems and rapping with raucous fans who shout their salutes. His bold baritone celebrates the South with such songs as `` Dixie on My Mind,'' `` If Heaven Ai n't a Lot Like Dixie'' and `` If the South Woulda Won.'' But his music is not entirely provincial. His `` A Country Boy Can Survive'' is about world tensions. `` Something to Believe In'' is about the struggles of the common man. He performs his high-voltage music by playing an array of instruments including guitar, banjo, fiddle, piano, steel guitar, harmonica and drums. `` I write songs that most of my fans can relate to, about everyday life,'' he said. `` I play six-seven instruments on stage, and they know if you are enjoying what you are doing.'' He's also had a turbo-charged lifestyle, having survived cocaine use, suicide attempts and a 500-foot fall off a <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> mountain in 1975 that required a year of anguished recovery. His ever present beard and sunglasses hide the stubborn scars. A spiffy cowboy hat tops off his commanding 6-foot-2 frame which tapers to gleaming cowboy boots. `` I do n't sit around the penthouse and polish my nails,'' he said. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who was just 3 when his father died, has recorded more than 50 albums. At one point in 1982, he had an unprecedented nine LPs on the country music charts. He made his first public performance at age 8 and was appearing on the road not long thereafter. He is a high school dropout. This year marks his 25th year as a recording artist. `` I'm proud of it,'' he said. `` The longevity has been good. It's hard to imagine all the good things that have happened in -LRB- just -RRB- the past eight years And I aim high.'' He inherited a famous name from his father, who in the early 1950s was country music's top star with hits including `` Your Cheatin' Heart,'' `` I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry'' and `` Hey Good Lookin'.'' But it was n't until this decade that the younger <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> decided to carve his own style and not be a clone of his father. `` I just started doing what I wanted to do not that long ago,'' he said. `` All that before does n't count in my book; I was just a kid; it was do this, do that. I was not that enamored with the music business then. It was all built in for me.'' He has used music videos to good advantage, enlisting rock' n' roll stars <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Halen </PERSON>, comedians Cheech and <PERSON> Chong </PERSON> and pro football stars among dozens of other celebrities who have appeared in them `` I call'em up and say this is <PERSON> Bocephus </PERSON> -LRB- his nickname -RRB-. I say do you want to do this thing. They say, ` yes.' It amazes me,'' he said. He recently pondered what his father would say about his career. `` He'd say, ` Boy, I knew you was going to do it all the time. I'm so proud of you; you got out there and did it the way you wanted to. I think he would be pretty happy over it.''

<HEAD>Scientists Studying Antarctic Ice Cap Holes For Climate Effects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Mysterious holes that periodically form in the ice covering <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> seas may serve as vents for excess heat and trapped gas, helping to shape the Earth's climate and influencing the `` greenhouse effect.'' These ice-free regions, some as large as <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, were n't discovered until 1974 when scientists began examining new satellite images of <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> and the frozen ocean encircling it Scientists do n't know if the holes called polynyas existed before then or even how frequently they develop in the vast ice cover. Teams of scientists from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have worked since 1981 to figure out how the holes form, what role they play in ocean circulation and how they affect the climate. Polynya -LRB- pronounced `` pa-lean-yah''' -RRB- is a Russian word used to identify an area in an ice field that is persistently free of ice, said <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, a professor of physical oceanography at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Some oceanographers believe the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> polynyas might play a role in the greenhouse effect that could have dire consequences in the coming century. As the world's largest oceans converge in an area unofficially named the <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> they expel heat from the tropical sun and probably some carbon dioxide from decaying fish and plants into the atmosphere, oceanographers say. `` This Antarctic zone region is very important to the global climate because this is where the ocean loses heat to the atmosphere,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, an authority on polynyas. Scientists believe that during the winter the polynyas act like vents to eliminate excess heat, and provide outlets for excess carbon dioxide that could kill marine life. Some scientists believe the greenhouse effect is caused by excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from tropical deforestation and burning fossil fuels. Polynyas, by venting carbon dioxide, also may be `` acting like our burning of fossil fuels and putting more CO2 in the atmosphere and contributing to the greenhouse effect warming of the climate,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said. `` That's why it's most critical that we know in the future what causes the polynya, what effect the heat and CO2 flux has on the greenhouse effect and how might that be changed in the future as the earth's atmosphere warms up.'' In a search for those answers, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> has visited <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> twice during the Southern Hemisphere's winter. He went in 1981 with Soviet scientists from the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic-Antarctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, and in 1986 with a West German team from the <ORGANIZATION> Alfred </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wegener </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bremerhaven </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, Soviet and West German scientists plan this summer to sample ice and water at varying depths near a large underwater ridge called <PERSON> Maud </PERSON> <PERSON> Rise </PERSON>. Scientists believe this ridge and others in the ocean floor may help create polynyas by pushing warmer water from the bottom up to the ice cover, where it melts the ice or prevents it from forming, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Polynyas </PERSON> also may develop because of the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> region's role in global ocean circulation, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Josefino </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Comiso </PERSON>, a physical scientist with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, reported in Scientific American. `` The exchanges of energy, water and gases between the ocean and the atmosphere around <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> have a major role in determining the large-scale motion, temperature and chemical composition of the ocean and atmosphere throughout the globe,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Comiso </PERSON> said in their June report. When the sun warms the oceans in the tropics and sub-tropics, `` the warm water mixes downward by vertical turbulence _ the heat from the upper layers is carried down by turbulence to the deep ocean,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> says. The warm water is drawn to <LOCATION> Antartica </LOCATION> by a complex process called wind-induced vertical upwelling: as the wind blows the upper 300 feet of water northward from <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>, it is replaced by the warmer, deeper water, `` like a giant conveyer belt.'' Scientists have identified two types of polynyas in the ice blanket that can cover an area up to twice the size of the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Coastal polynyas `` are essentially sea-ice factories,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Comiso </PERSON> wrote. They develop when strong local winds blow ice away from the shoreline and remain unfrozen as warm water surges up from the bottom. `` This exposes an area of open ocean on which more ice can form, continuing the process.'' Open-ocean polynyas form in the middle of the vast ice cover on the ocean around <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> and could `` have a great effect on the chemistry and climate of the atmosphere and the deep ocean worldwide,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Comiso </PERSON> wrote. But they `` occur irregularly and at this point are unpredictable,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said. Scientists believe small polynyas _ about 40 square miles _ probably form for several weeks during the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> winter and then inexplicably disappear, but they've also discovered much larger holes in the ice. `` They are so big that you can not really think they do not have any impact at all'' on the Earth's climate, <PERSON> Comiso </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. In 1974, oceanographers found a polynya about the size of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Weddell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>'s ice cover. During the summer, the ice melted, as it usually does, but in the winter of 1975 the giant polynya mysteriously reformed in just about the same area. It disappeared again during the summer and reappeared in 1976. In 1977, it did n't return Smaller polynyas have developed for several weeks since then in the same area, but the mammoth one has n't returned. Another large polynya _ 36,000 square kilometers _ has been observed since in the Cosmonaut Sea, also in an area of a large undersea ridge, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said. `` The real question,'' he said, `` is what causes these really big ones, because those are the ones that will have a major impact on the climate.''

<HEAD>Surgeon Hopes to Use Robot For Surgery By Remote Control</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WOODY BAIRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A robot surgeon that mimics and `` downsizes'' human movements could be more precise than the doctors guiding it, says a surgeon who hopes one day to perform the most delicate eye operations by remote control. Dr. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, who has been working on his robot for about a year, expects in another year to have equipment ready for testing on dummy eyes in the operating room. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, 46, says he has spent about $ 300,000 so far. `` Nobody else now is working on robotics operated by a human being where it mimics his motions but downsizes them,'' he said. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>' system, which uses three groups of machines and supporting computers, would allow a doctor to view his patient's eye on a TV screen while performing surgical movements with tools similar in concept to joysticks used for video games. Small mechanical arms would actually perform the surgery. `` One -LRB- group -RRB- would be analogous to a person's head and eye muscles that positions the microscope,'' he said. `` The other two robots position the surgical tools to work on a dummy head with dummy eyes in it.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, an engineering student in undergraduate school, specializes in microsurgery that can require removal of tiny scars from a patient's retina. He said the equipment could be adapted to other delicate surgery, as well. `` Robots that are manually operated now are for things like fixing up nuclear reactors, picking up submarine parts at the bottom of the ocean or black boxes after airplane crashes, the hazardous environment stuff,'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> said. `` They're like great big gorillas. Now, we'll have a guy that is more precise than the most precise watchmaker or surgeon ever was.'' He hopes his robot also will let a surgeon operate on a patient hundreds or thousands of miles away _ in remote areas or on a space station, for example. A medical team would be required on the scene to set up the equipment and monitor the patient, but the surgeon could be elsewhere. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> has set up the Center for Engineering Applications to pursue his robot project and signed up <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, an electrical engineer to handle the day-to-day lab work. The project has attracted assistance from engineers and physicians around the country, including specialists with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, he said. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, a member of the surgical staff at <LOCATION> Baptist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> here, has gotten a $ 300,000 grant from the <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and is looking for further assistance from government grants or foundations. `` It's the kind of thing that will never get finished,'' he said. `` It will be evolving with better performance every year. We anticipate a budget that ultimately will approach the range of $ 3 million to $ 4 million a year. `` This is public domain stuff. This is not an entrepreneurial effort on my part.'' Much of the progress on developing the equipment will depend on continued advances in small-motor technology and related fields, he said. Specialists in those areas say research on small-motor technology is a growth industry.

<HEAD>Winemaking Still an Art, Science Convention Told</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> wines, among the most manipulated in the world, are heavily in debt to science for their quality. Winemaking, of course, will always be an art, said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, president of thhe <ORGANIZATION> Harmony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` A winemaker is primarily a stylist.'' It remains for the winemaker to arrive at the crucial decisions: when to harvest, what type of grape, how long to age it and whether in steel or wood, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Science. Still, science has opened new understanding of the way grapes grow and how they can flavor the wine, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mondavi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Winery </ORGANIZATION>. `` We've only recently learned that we can control flavor at the grape level.'' In the next few years, said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s traditional bushy vines during the growing season might be replaced by configurations including narrow leaf-walls _ to better control the sunlight received by the vines. Before and during the growing season, winemakers will go into the vineyards to try to engineer vines and leaves for sunlight and shade to produce grapes with character, color, varietal intensity, flavor and aroma. For example, a sunlight-starved vine will produce overly herbaceous wines; grapes that have gotten lots of sun produce brighter wines with berry flavors. Other elements in wine flavor are n't so easily explained. A few years ago, at a <LOCATION> Napa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> tasting, judges found a wine with overtones of eucalyptus _ they learned that a large stand of eucalyptus trees grew near the vineyard.

 A solar-powered pump thhat tracks the sun through the sky with an array of mirrors could be useful for irrigating fields and in out-of-the-way places where maintenance is difficult. A 36-square-foot array could provide power to pump 16,000 gallons of water a day, enough to irrigate 5 to 10 acres, said <PERSON> Khanh </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinh </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alachua </LOCATION>, who began developing the pump after he left <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1975 and got a $ 75,000 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> grant for the project in 1982. Vietnamese farmers need an effective way to irrigate rice paddies without using diesel-fueled pumps. <PERSON> Dinh </PERSON> said his pump would cost about $ 5,000, compared with about $ 1,000 for a diesel pump. Over 10 years, he estimated the diesel pump would cost $ 13,000 in fuel and maintenance; the solar pump would need little maintenance. <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> researchers are monitoring <PERSON> Dinh </PERSON>'s pump before hooking it to an actual irrigation system. Irrigating farm fields requires a constanst flow of water, which is difficult for a solar system, said <PERSON> Dorota </PERSON> <PERSON> Haman </PERSON>, an assistant professor in the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Agricultural engineering professor <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Direlle </PERSON> <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> said much work needs to be done before the pump would be effective for irrigation. A battery system to store energy for when the sun is obscured might be too costly, he said. <PERSON> Dihn </PERSON> said his design effectively doubles the collection capability of the solar panels. He also sees potential uses outside agriculture. The <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> is considering a solar pump in the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>, where diesel and electric pumps are difficult to maintain.

<HEAD>Sex Therapists Face Ethical Dilemma With AIDS-Infected Patients</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 AIDS is forcing sex therapists to confront new ethical issues in deciding how to treat patients who also are infected by the virus. `` Do we as physicians have the right to withhold treatment of sexual dysfunction in patients who have a potentially lethal disease?'' Dr. <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Lightfoote-Young </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Sepulveda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, asked in January's issue of The Western Journal of Medicine. The ethical dilemma was illustrated by the case of a 55-year-old AIDS-infected man who was unable to have an erection because of circulation problems stemming from diabetes. Before the man's AIDS infection was diagnosed, a sex therapy clinic had promised him a device that would help him achieve and maintain erections so he could have sex. After it was revealed the man carried the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus, he complained that clinic staff members were stalling him. `` This patient had frequented bathhouses before his positive -LRB- AIDS -RRB- test and was ambivalent regarding his sexual practices in the future,'' <PERSON> Lightfoote-Young </PERSON> wrote in a letter to the journal. `` He made no commitment ... to use his newly functional penis inside a condom.'' The man got the device after promising to wear a condom and inform any sex partners that he was infected, she said in an interview. His case not only raises the question of whether doctors should withhold treatment for such people's sexual disorders, but also whether treatment should be provided only if patients promise to engage only `` safe'' sexual activities that wo n't spread the virus to other people. Among the questions it raises, said <PERSON> Lightfoote-Young </PERSON>, are, `` By what measure can we be responsible if a patient does infect another person while using a device to enhance sexual function? `` If we do not treat sexual dysfunction in -LRB- AIDS-infected -RRB- patients, are we infringing upon the rights of the individual, as this patient alleged? `` And what of society and our responsibility to the health of potential partners? Are the patient's verbal assurances sufficient, or does there need to be a formal psychiatric assessment of a patient's stability and reliability?''

 Under a bright winter sun off Apple Cove Point in Puget Sound, Miss <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON>'s crew hauled in the seine and dumped a catch of chum salmon on the deck. The net was far from full, but there was no disappointment. These salmon were meant for laboratories, not dinner tables, and the crew would be paid no matter the size of the catch. They only needed 200 chum under the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> contract. The fish were cut into samples instead of steaks so biologists can learn more about the dozens of runs of chum returning to Puget Sound streams, and so fisheries managers can try to maximize the catch on strong runs, and protect weak stocks by ordering closures for specific times and places. The northern sound, where it meets Admiralty Inlet is `` a big stock area, with a wide mix of different species of salmon from different parts of Puget Sound and <LOCATION> Hood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>,'' said biologist <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Messenger </PERSON>. `` Nobody really has a handle on what that mixture is.'' Aboard the 55-foot Miss <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON>, the chum were hefted onto a cutting table. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>, the Indian fisheries commission's biologist in charge, sliced the fish `` We collect scales, record the length of the fish and its sex, as well as take tissue samples. We take muscle tissue, and heart and liver tissue.'' The salmon species _ chinook or king, coho or silver, sockeye, pink and chum _ sex and age go into a database used to determine the catches that will be allowed next season. Test fisheries conducted during the seasons between spring and fall will allow catch limits to be changed mid-season. Besides that primary information, collection of biological samples gives scientists much more complete data on the stream-by-stream abundance of salmon runs, through a process called `` genetic stock identification.'' The samples are quickly frozen on dry ice and taken to a state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> lab </ORGANIZATION>, where they are pureed together in a blender. The proteins are removed and put in a dyed gel, and an electrical field is applied. The proteins leave distinctive patterns in the gel because each accepts a charge differntly. With chum, stocks from each stream of origin have differing proteins, so the numbers of fish from each stream can be calculated. The `` base line'' for comparisons is established from chum salmon collected from the rivers. `` You can break it down into fine details,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>. `` For instance, you can break it down to the <LOCATION> Nisqually </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>.'' But salmon run estimates will remain an imprecise science with a resource that travels thousands of miles over years before it returns to a home stream. `` They wo n't hold still so we can count'em,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, chief of harvest management for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's not like a bunch of oysters.'' Genetic stock identification is only one of the tools used to track fish through their life cycle from stream to ocean to stream. Others include tagging with coded wires inserted in the fishes' snouts, and `` otolith banding,'' which is marking the fishes' equivalent of the inner ear for later `` reading <ORGANIZATION> GSI </ORGANIZATION> works especially well for chum because it can be used for wild or free-spawning fish, and most chum are not hatchery stock. However, some salmon, including sockeye, have little differences in proteins and are thus poor candidates for the process, said Ms. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>. However, the chum study has confirmed tagging studies showing movement of various Puget Sound stocks of the species, she said. In some cases, especially with depressed stocks, `` it shows we're doing the right thing.''

 Share prices were lower at midday Monday, although off the day's worst levels, as dealers questioned the market's recent rapid rally and took profits, dealers said Some dealers said the slide in share prices was kicked off by a large early morning sell program. Others said shares dropped as the market's recent stock shortage was alleviated. Either way, they said the market's retrenchment after a rise of nearly 15 percent since the beginning of the year was not cause for worry. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 19.7 points, or 0.9 percent, at 2,050.2 just after noon -LRB- 1200 GMT -RRB-, well below the day's high point of 2,075.5 which came near the start to official trading.

 Futures prices of grain and soybeans opened mostly lower today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> on perceptions that Friday's late rally had been largely unwarranted. The runup late in Friday's trading session was sparked by reports that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had ordered the evacuation of 20 Ukrainian villages in an area contaminated with radiation from the 1986 <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear accident. `` You heard the word Chernobyl and everybody started to buy'' on fears of a new radiation leak and contamination of Soviet crops, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a grain trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. But cooler heads prevailed this morning as traders realized there had been no new radiation leakage and no cause for alarm. Heavy weekend snowfall in the Corn Belt was another bearish factor in the corn and soybean markets. In early trading, wheat was 1 \ cents to 2 \ cents lower with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.28 a bushel; corn was -RCB- cent to 1 \ cents lower with March at $ 2.70 -RCB- a bushel; oats were \ cent lower to -LCB- cent higher with March at $ 2.18 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 3 \ cents lower with March at $ Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were lower in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Thinking Long Term</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If financial and economic proposals by <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> are representative of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's goals, then eyes will be focused on the long term. Long term is a concept that had been trampled and forgotten by American business. In government, financial crises made implementation impossible. At the consumer level it showed up as spending rather than saving. To change such ingrained attitudes is an enormous challenge, made even more difficult by two related symptoms of the recent past: a deterioration of quality, and a tendency of Americans to prefer consumption to production. Making it easier, however, is the fact that in some respects the change already is in motion. A bit of background: After the easy days of the 1960s, some American industries went to sleep, assured that they were the best and that it was up to others to catch them. The `` others,'' such as the Japanese, caught them and then outperformed them. With the pressure on, many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers sought desperately to keep sales and earnings from shrinking by resorting to expedients. Thinking became short term to meet the immediate challenge. Quality suffered. Adding to the pressure was the new attitude on <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, which stressed immediate profits rather than long-term strength. It made investing for the long term all the more difficult. Traders wanted results now _ not later. Runaway inflation worsened things, shortening the focus even more. And rising interest rates created an almost impossible situation. How could anyone focus on a long term that could n't be foreseen? Short-term survival was in. Eventually, American industry and government and individuals had to face the music. While opportunists and exploiters of the situation could benefit for the short term, such as by borrowing and repaying in cheap dollars, the general public and its institutions were being weakened to collapse. Faced with the inevitable, industry caught hold of itself, bit the bullet, took its short-term losses, invested in capital improvements whose payoff was years into the future, raised quality and sought to become more competitive. For many companies _ automotive concerns, for example _ it paid off, and once again they are healthy. Higher quality has been built not just into physical facilities but into the thinking of workers and executives. Unions helped, recognizing that the only way to reclaim jobs lost to foreign companies was to restrain wages and cooperate in raising productivity. And, as inflation cooled, realistic plans for the future could be made again. The process, though under way, still has a long way to go. The investing scene has been a notable laggard, with corporate raiders still seeking instant profits versus long-term performance, and brokers urging investors to trade on short-term news rather than investing for the future. In the consumer area, there is still a tendency to live beyond means, as shown by the persistence of installment debt and a savings rate that remains relatively low. But that too has begun to change, and some analysts forecast a steady increase in savings as the so-called baby-boomer generation ages. If there is indeed a growing tendency to think longer term today, it seemingly could n't be hurt by a lift from public policy. Among other things, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> would consider lowering the capital gains tax on long-term investments to just 15 percent, compared with 28 percent to 33 percent now, hoping thereby to encourage long-term investing. Pension fund managers, who sit on the largest mound of financial assets in the world, would be encouraged in ways not yet made clear to invest for long-term rewards. And leveraged buyouts would somehow be curtailed or discouraged. Whether these particular techniques will work is likely to be debated vigorously. But it is n't likely that there'll be much debate about the long term versus short term issue itself. Those bad old days are still fresh enough to serve as a warning.

 The stock market headed lower today, giving up some of its recent gains. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which started 1989 with five consecutive weeks of gains, fell 14.29 to 2,316.96 by noontime today on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 9 to 5 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 449 up, 808 down and 534 unchanged. Analysts said traders were leery of bidding very aggressively for stocks, suspecting that the market was due for a pause after its winter-long rally. Some observers argue that the market's early-1989 gains may have stemmed largely from the so-called `` January effect,'' which tends to push prices higher at the start of the year as tax selling pressures abate. Investors also appeared a little confused about the state of the economy. A <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report last week showed strong growth in payroll employment for January. But a monthly survey of purchasing executives indicated that growth slowed in January from the rapid pace it set in December. <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> jumped 8 -LCB- to 47 -RCB- as the most active <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> issue. <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said it had acquired 8 percent of the company's stock <ORGANIZATION> Formica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> climbed 4 to 20 -RCB-.

<HEAD>Rig Count Drops by 17, Totals 780</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The number of working oil and natural gas rigs dropped this week by 17 to total 780 as the count continued its see-saw activity, industry watcher <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported. Last week the number of rigs rose by eight to total 797 while plummeting by 51 the week before. The previous three weeks the count declined twice by 32 and once by 36, all following a two-week increase of 25 rigs. A year ago, the number of rigs totaled 986, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said Monday. The decline follows normal seasonal patterns, according to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> economist <PERSON> Ike </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerridge </PERSON>. The count usually drops off during late December through late March or early April, he said. The count is a widely watched industry index of drilling activity and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing oil. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an oil toolmaker company that merged with <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, has kept track of the number of working rigs since 1940. In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig count reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $ 10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> began compiling figures. The lowest level last year was the reported 880 rigs on May 2. Among major oil producing states, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> saw a decline at four, followed by <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, two; and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, one each. <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> had gains of two each while <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> had one.

<HEAD>Mexico Decides Against $3.5 Billion US Loan Although Offer Still

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> offer of a $ 3.5 billion emergency loan remains open, officials said Monday, even though <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has decided not to borrow the money and is trying to renegotiate payments on its crippling foreign debt. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspe </PERSON> was beginning talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, armed with what aides described as a `` menu of options'' for repaying the $ 106 billion <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> owes foreign creditors. Late Sunday, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issued a brief statement saying <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> would not use the $ 3.5 billion short-term loan the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> offered in October. The money, the largest single <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> loan ever offered to a debt-burdened nation, was intended as a cushion against political and economic instablity during a change in administrations. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the money is still available if <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> wants it. `` The offer does not expire until April,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Telkins </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> statement said <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> did n't need the $ 3.5 billion short-term loan because the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION>'s international reserves stopped falling in December It did not elaborate. The loan was aimed at helping <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> weather the sensitive months before the Dec. 1 inauguration of President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>. A change of administrations in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> historically has been marked by a drain on capital caused by businesses and the wealthy, who fear changes in economic policies and send money abroad as a protection. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wanted to help <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> avoid the pressure such an exodus puts on the peso currency, which has been devalued severely over the past several years. The bank has said about $ 1.6 billion has returned to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in recent months. The loan also was intended to tide <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> over until it could renegotiate new credit packages with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and other world lending institutions. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> is facing widespread public impatience with a 7-year-old economic crisis that has stagnated growth and halved the average worker's buying power. Voters gave him the smallest victory margin in 60 years of his ruling party's history in the July 6 election and even this slim victory was clouded by widespread allegations of fraud. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> has said renegotiating the debt is his top priority and that payments must be cut enough to let <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s economy start growing again. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has been devoting the equivalent of nearly six per cent of its gross national product to satisfy debt payments. Last year the payments, most of them interest, came to about $ 13 billion. About 40 percent of the foreign debt, the second-largest in the developing world after <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s, is owed to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks. There was no official comment from the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> Monday on what options <PERSON> Aspe </PERSON> planned to present to creditors in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, but news reports said that among the ideas under consideration were debt-for-investment swaps, in which creditor banks would exchange some debt for an equity stake in Mexican businesses.

<HEAD>Restructuring Costs Result In 1988 Loss For Manville</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November, on Monday reported it lost $ 1.31 billion in the fourth quarter because of costs from its restructuring. The loss in the final quarter of the year compared with a $ 59.98 million shortfall in the same period of 1987. The results of the latest quarter reflected a $ 1.3 billion charge from <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION>'s Chapter 11 reorganization. <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said in a statement the company expected the charge as `` the price we knew we had to pay to put our asbestos financial obligations behind us.'' The company filed for protection under federal bankruptcy laws in 1982 because of claims from people who suffered illnesses because of contact with asbestos. Without the charge, <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> said it would have lost $ 26.3 million in the fourth quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> reported fourth-quarter sales of $ 522.1 million, up from $ 486 million a year earlier. For the full year, <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> reported a loss of nearly $ 1.3 billion, compared to earnings of $ 72.6 million, or 61 cents per share, in all of 1987. The full-year loss also included a $ 139 million pre-tax charge for environmental cleanup costs, and a $ 107 million charge for an accounting change. Without the charges, <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> said it would have earned nearly $ 96 million in 1988. Full-year sales totaled $ 2.06 billion, up from $ 1.94 billion.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Share prices fell sharply Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, depressed largely by data showing British retail sales were higher in December than had been initially reported. The data, which dispelled some hopes of an early cut in domestic interest rates, added to profit-taking pressure, which followed the market's surge of about 250 points since the start of the year. At the close of trading the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index was down 25.6 points, or 1.23 percent, at 2,044.3. A weak opening on Wall Street helped drag the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> index down as much as 26.4 points in the late afternoon. Volume was moderate, with 561.5 million shares changing hands, well below Friday's turnover of 768.7 million shares. The market's recent strong rise has been partly due to indications of a slowdown in consumer demand, which in turn helped to inspire hopes of a cut in British interest rates, perhaps around the time of the fiscal 1990 budget presentation in March. Those hopes were at least partly dispelled by a revision to the December retail sales figures, which were adjusted upward to a gain of 0.3 percent from a preliminary reported decline of 0.1 percent. The narrower <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 30-share index was down 20.8 points at 1,668.2. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 500-share index closed at 1,155.17, down 12.61.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan to bail out the savings and loan industry will include a temporary hike in insurance premiums paid by banks and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls as well as a revamped regulatory structure, an industry official said today. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would announce his plan to resolve the S & amp; L crisis at a late-afternoon news conference and would not propose that depositors be required to pay a fee. Banks have been given assurances that the money raised by the higher premiums will go into their own insurance fund and will not directly pay for the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L problem, said the source, who was briefed by <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides but declined to be identified. However, for budget purposes, the money raised by the premiums will count as revenue. Thus, in an arrangement envisioned by <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, the government would be able to spend several billions of taxpayer dollars a year without adding to the budget deficit, a government official said. Insurance premiums are currently 83 cents per $ 1,000 for banks and $ 2.08 for <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls. The increase mentioned, at least before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reviewed the plan, would bring the premiums to about $ 1.80 per $ 1,000 for banks and $ 2.50 for <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls. That would raise about half the $ 7 billion to $ 9 billion needed each year. Another element of the plan would merge the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which insures bank deposits, with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. A new five-member board would oversee the two insurance funds Meanwhile, a separate three-member board chaired by the secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> would control the spending of the new money raised to close or sell the 350 insolvent <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls remaining open. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> will lose control of the S & amp; L insurance fund and it will be brought into the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in a system similar to the one used for banks, where the regulatory agency, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, is part of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>. A presidential aide, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> advocate this arrangement, which will be strongly opposed by the S & amp; L industry which wants to keep its regulator independent of other government controls, the industry official said. `` The president will propose a permanent and comprehensive solution to the S & amp; L situation ... as well as a financing arrangement that does not include depositor fees,'' spokesman <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said earlier. The plan `` will deal with problem thrifts as well as the foundation for future stability in the industry,'' he said. `` The president will propose reforms in the federal regulatory structure ... -LRB- and -RRB- he will assure all Americans that the full faith and credit of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government stands behind their deposits and that the American banking system remains sound,'' the spokesman said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration had conferred with congressional leaders and said, `` We think there'll be general support for this proposal.'' Another financing problem is how to sell the bonds without inflating the government's already huge $ 2.7 trillion national debt. A way around that is to cover the principal of the bonds with several billion dollars in retained earnings at the regional <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION>, which are owned by the industry. That way, only the annual interest paid on the bonds would be `` on-budget.'' However the money is raised, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration are sure to assume more control over how it is spent. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have complained bitterly about S & amp; L regulators' power to write promissory notes committing the government to vast expenditures that the regulators can not pay _ in effect writing checks that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> later will be forced to cover with appropriations. Other likely recommendation would require S & amp; L owners to put up more of their own money, force <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls to keep more cash reserves for liquidity, limit the amount they can loan to a single borrower and more strictly control who can buy or start an S & amp; L.

<HEAD>Final Conflict For Carrier?</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After more than two years of taunts, feints and jabs, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> management and its largest union are standing toe-to-toe with a potential slugfest threatening the money-losing carrier's survival. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, a year after entering <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> contract talks with its <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, last week declared an impasse and began a 30-day cooling-off period that ends March 3. If no settlement is reached by then, the company would impose its last contract offer _ $ 150 million in salary cuts _ and the 8,500-member union, representing more than one-fourth of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> employees, would be allowed to strike. The two sides are $ 200 million apart, with the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>' last offer seeking a $ 50 million raise. But money is only part of the confrontation marked by deep philosophical differences. Veteran Eastern Machinistsleader <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, the District 100 president, has tried unsuccessfully to engineer an employee-controlled takeover, believing that a company whose workers have a say in decision-making and a stake in profits will work efficiently and productively. He believes his workers have been paying for poor management for years and have current management that does n't care about <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s future. The Eastern management put in place by Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> since it took over the carrier 2 -LCB- years ago seeks a lean operation with the shots called by corporate executives. They see an airline with good routes, experience and overall good structure that needs to reduce operating costs _ mainly labor _ to turn around after losing $ 1 billion the past decade. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> played a leading role in bringing down former <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Borman </PERSON>, the Apollo astronaut replaced after <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> bought Eastern in an 11th-hour deal in February 1986. But Eastern's new management features airline experience directed by <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, a bottom-line entrepreneur who got rid of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' unions after taking over that airline. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> went to the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> shareholders' meeting arguing against the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> takeover, and he has been the focus since of widespread <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> labor opposition to the new management, whose style has aggravated traditionally tense labor relations at Eastern. The Machinists, pilots and flight attendants unions have tried to head off management at any pass, waging myriad lawsuits and grievances and lobbying politicians. But recent months have seen events going the cost-cutting management's way. It won court approval for 4,000 layoffs and major route cuts last year, along with the $ 365 million sale of its profitable <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> shuttle to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> refused to reopen last year's probe that concluded Eastern was operated safely. Management has been lobbying for months for declaration of an impasse, insisting that <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> IAM </ORGANIZATION> wo n't seriously negotiate until they are faced with a deadline. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> says management has been trying to provoke a strike and will try to break the strike and bust <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unions. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said that he'll work for a settlement, but his union will be ready for a `` wing-ding of a strike.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s lead mediator, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bickford </PERSON>, has met with both sides separately in recent days and is expected to continue such `` shuttle diplomacy.'' If talks get to the final 10 days, <ORGANIZATION> NMB </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> will jawbone the two sides in `` super-mediation,'' participants expect. It seems unlikely there will be any settlement before the final few hours, putting pressure on travel agents. But Eastern management is counting on strong frequent-flier business travel to stick with the airline despite uncertainty. Eastern has been to the brink before. In 1983, the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> went to the final days of a cooling-off period before a settlement was reached. In 1986, strikes and bankruptcy were hours away when deals were cut to avoid selling Eastern.

<HEAD>Grains, Soybean Futures Tumble In Surprising Sell-Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Futures prices of corn and soybeans fell sharply Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, resuming a trend that had been interrupted in Friday's session by unwarranted fears of a radiation leak in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Wheat and oat futures also closed lower. Grain futures gave back all the gains posted Friday, when a late rally was sparked by reports that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had ordered the evacuation of 20 Ukrainian villages in an agricultural area contaminated with radiation from the 1986 <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear accident. The mere mention of the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> incident apparently was enough to prompt heavy buying of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain futures on Friday. But the realization that there had been no new radiation leakage was a key factor in Monday's sell-off, analysts said. Analysts said heavy weekend snow in the <LOCATION> Corn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belt </LOCATION>, which will add badly needed moisture to the soil, also contributed to Monday's decline At the close of trading, wheat was 1 cent to 4 -LCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.25 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 4 -RCB- cents to 6 cents lower with March at $ 2.66 \ a bushel; oats were 4 cents to 4 -RCB- cents lower with March at $ 2.14 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 11 cents to 16 -LCB- cents lower with March at $ 7.54 a bushel

 Stock prices retreated Monday amid some evident doubts about the staying power of the market's recent rally. But activity remained lively in stocks of several companies involved in takeover news or rumors. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which started 1989 with five consecutive weeks of gains, fell 10.18 to 2,321.07. Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 636 up, 786 down and 517 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 150.98 million shares, down from 172.98 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 178.50 million shares. Analysts said traders were leery of bidding very aggressively for stocks, suspecting that the market was due for a pause after its winter-long rally. Some observers argue that the market's early-1989 gains may have stemmed largely from the so-called `` January effect,'' which tends to push prices higher at the start of the year as tax selling pressures abate.

 The dollar fell Monday against several major foreign currencies but edged up against the British pound and Japanese yen in a mixed session marked by more dollar sales by the central banks. Foreign-exchange dealers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> said the absence of any strong policy statements arising from the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> industrialized nations meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Friday provided the foundation for a further strengthening of the dollar. The bullishness was dampened by intervention from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, West German <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> and other European central banks, which sold dollars to stem the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency's rise.

In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.43 yen to close at 129.70.

<HEAD>Pork Futures Collapse On Milder-Than-Expected Weather</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Pork futures prices collapsed Monday in a disappointed reaction to indications that wintry conditions in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> had not slowed the movement of hogs to packing houses. In other markets, orange-juice futures continued to decline; grain and soybean futures fell sharply; precious metals advanced; and energy futures weakened. On the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, live hog futures finished .50 cent to 1.42 cents lower with the contract for delivery in February at 42.70 cents a pound. Most contracts for future delivery of frozen pork bellies plummeted the permitted daily limit of 2 cents with February settling at 38.82 cents a pound. Cattle futures fared much better. Live cattle settled .40 cent lower to .10 cent higher with February at 75.40 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .40 cent higher with March at 84.47 cents a pound. Expectations for a cold-weather slump in hog marketings turned out to be a bust for speculators who had bid pork futures up sharply on Friday. Instead of a decline, packers reported that hog marketings over the weekend and on Monday were higher than both week-ago and year-ago levels. The hog flow in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, for example, totaled 120,000 head on Monday, compared with 110,000 a week earlier and 95,000 a year ago. Spot-market prices for hogs plunged by as much as 3 cents a pound and the futures market followed suit with pork-belly contracts leading the way. `` That's what happens when you do n't get enough of a storm,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hare </PERSON>, a livestock-market analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. The plunging pork prices led to some weakness in the cattle market, but many cattle traders were reluctant to sell ahead of Wednesday's national cattle inventory report from the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. That report is expected to show the nation's cattle herd as of Jan. 1 at its lowest level since 1960, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>, senior livestock analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Weather-related selling also hit orange-juice futures on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Frozen concentrated orange juice settled 4 cents to 4.6 cents lower with March at $ 1.354 a pound as fears of a freeze in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> citrus groves continued to ease. Corn and soybean futures fell sharply on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, resuming a trend that had been interrupted in Friday's session by unwarranted fears of a radiation leak in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> Wheat and oat futures also closed lower. Grain futures gave back all the gains posted Friday, when a late rally was sparked by reports that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had ordered the evacuation of 20 Ukrainian villages in an agricultural area contaminated with radiation from the 1986 <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear accident. The mere mention of the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> incident apparently was enough to prompt heavy buying of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain futures on Friday. But the realization that there had been no new radiation leakage was a key factor in Monday's sell-off, analysts said. Wheat settled -RCB- cent to 4 -LCB- cents lower with March at $ 4.25 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 4 -RCB- cents to 6 cents lower with March at $ 2.66 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 4 cents to 4 -RCB- cents lower with March at $ 2.14 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 12 cents to 16 \ cents lower with March at $ 7.54 \ a Gold and silver futures advanced on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in active late buying after being down for most of the session.

 Energy futures prices were mostly lower in light trading Monday, influenced in part by OPEC-related concerns. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the March contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, settled 15 cents lower at $ 17.38 a barrel after seesawing last week. Other contract months also declined. Among refined products traded on the exchange, the March contract for domestic heating oil rose 0.5 cent to 50.36 cents a gallon but other contract months fell. Unleaded gasoline for March delivery closed 0.43 cent lower at 48.74 cents a gallon with other contract months ending the day mixed. Analysts said prices were little influenced by the cold weather, despite rumors of refinery slowdowns in southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. They said the cold weather arrived late in the season, after most buyers had already purchased their winter stocks. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiedler </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> E.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Man </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, attributed much of the price decline to technical factors. `` They're looking for a new support level, probably heading down to $ 17,'' <PERSON> Fiedler </PERSON> said. Prices also came under pressure from a report by the Middle East Economic Survey, a respected industry publication, that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had a large buildup of unsold inventory that it was looking to get rid of, said <PERSON> Nauman </PERSON> <PERSON> Barakat </PERSON>, vice president of energy investments at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` My own opinion is that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> wo n't dump it, but the question is, what will they do with it?'' <PERSON> Barakat </PERSON> said. Since the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> lowered its production by some 4 million barrels a day to 18.5 million barrels on Jan. 1, market observers have expressed concern over the whereabouts of all the excess oil. Many had expected world oil prices to remain soft while the oversupply came on the market. Instead, prices have soared over the last several weeks, leaving analysts to wonder what happened to the excess. Monday's report on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was one of the first to confirm existence of the excess petroleum.

 <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s disclosure of a stake in <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> raised speculation Monday that the oil company has found a way to spend a big chunk of the $ 3 billion cache won from a protracted battle with <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Although <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> said it had acquired about 12 million shares of <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> as an investment, or about an 8 percent interest, the company did not rule out future transactions. `` We may dispose of all our part -LRB- of the stock -RRB- or we may buy additional shares,'' <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> said Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> is not looking to force a `` merger, reorganization, liquidation, sale or transfer of a material amount of assets, or any change of management'' in <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, a large Seattle-based diversified resource and energy holding company. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Monday, <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>'s stock soared $ 9.87 -LCB- a share to $ 49.12 -LCB- compared with Friday's close. <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> closed up $ 1.50 at $ 83.25 a share. <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> filed documents with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Friday because it had exceeded 5 percent ownership of <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> stock, <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> said. Under SEC rules, any investment in a publicly held company that passes the 5 percent threshhold must be reported to the federal agency. <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> disclosed it had bought nearly 8.6 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> stock for about $ 300 million and got 3.4 million more shares as a result of a distribution by <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> purchased another 355,000 shares earlier this month, the company said. <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> Resources was spun off last year from <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION>. The stock acquisition was an investment, but <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> said in its <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing it will take `` actions deemed appropriate'' pending its continued review of <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>'s business affairs. A spokesman for <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> Resources did not return telephone calls Monday. Industry observers have been waiting to see how <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> would spend the $ 3 billion settlement it received last April from <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> to end the companies' four-year legal battle over <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION> Prior to the <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> stock purchase, <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>'s only major investment since the <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> settlement had been the $ 250 million purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Facet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Facet manufactures automotive parts and oil-field equipment. One analyst said Monday that <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>'s stock acquisition does n't mean <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> is an actual takeover target `` Their move is perplexing,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuklinski </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Cowen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` It is not clear to me if this is anything more than an investment. Typically, when a company acquires this size of stock, the intention is fairly evident, but not this time.'' <PERSON> Kuklinski </PERSON> said that in the past, <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> has acquired fairly good amounts of stock for investment purposes and not followed through with takeover attempts. In addition, <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> has some attractive assets it would be expensive to buy, he said. But other analysts said they believe <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> is positioning itself for a takeover _ whether by accumulating more stock on the open market or by making an offer _ before <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> has the opportunity to put up more barriers. <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> has shown little interest in being acquired, installing a `` poison pill'' and other takeover defenses in December. The pill, designed to make an unwelcome takeover prohibitively expensive, would be triggered when a hostile bidder acquired 20 percent or more of the voting power of <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>. `` The cat is in the bag. I'm sure they wo n't sit on their hands on this one. I think they will actively pursue something one way or another,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Londe </PERSON>, an analyst with <PERSON> A.G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Londe </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> likely wo n't take the whole company, but `` gas reserves are first on the menu.'' <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> is believed to hold the largest natural gas reserves in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> outside of the major oil companies, with a nearly 18-year supply, compared with an industry average of 10 years. A merger of <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> would propel the company into a position just under the majors in natural gas reserves, <PERSON> Londe </PERSON> said. `` They would have 5.8 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves _ that means a lot,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>' largest units include <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which consists of a 22,000-mile interstate gas transmission system extending from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Meridian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's largest independent oil and gas companies. <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> also has extensive mining operations, including gold, and more than a million acres of timberland. Analysts valued <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> stock at between $ 49 and $ 51 a share.

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors on Monday declared a 2-for-1 stock split in the form of a 100 percent dividend on <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> $ 1 2-3 par value common stock. Directors in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> declared the stock split after approving a 20 percent increase in the per-share dividend on the common stock, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. The board also increased the per-share dividend on Class E and Class H common stock by 41 percent and 64 percent, respectively, the statement said. Dividends for the first quarter of 1989 came to $ 1.50 per share of $ 1 2-3 par value common stock, 24 cents per share of Class E and 18 cents per share of Class H, payable March 10 to shareholders of record Feb. 16, the statement said. The dividend resulting from the 2-for-1 split was payable March 31 to shareholders of record Feb. 17, it said. `` The fact that <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> can take these actions ... is further important evidence of the great strength of the company and in particular the continued success of <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s reindustrialization program,'' <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` The stock dividend is expected to make <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> $ 1 2-3 common stock more affordable for individual investors following the stock's significant appreciation over the past year,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said To reflect the split, the <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> board increased the number of $ 1 2-3 common shares covered by its stock repurchase program from 64 million to 128 million, the statement said. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> announced the program in March 1987 and had repurchased 27.8 million shares on a post-split basis through Dec. 31, 1988, it said. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said it has completed its initial repurchase of 5 million Class E shares and has bought 1.9 million of 5 million shares under a second Class E repurchase program begun in May 1988. Through December 1988, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> had obtained 3 million of 10 million Class H shares under a repurchase program begun in March 1987 the statement said. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> also has continued repurchasing shares in each of the three categories of stocks to meet benefit plan requirements, the statement said.

<HEAD>Fourth-Quarter Earnings Fall 32 Percent, Huge Loss For Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the troubled aerospace-steelmaker, said Monday its profit dropped 32 percent in the fourth-quarter, primarily because of a charge involving an accounting change for medical and life insurance benefits. For the year, the company said it lost $ 3.15 billion, mainly due to special charges taken earlier in the year. The company has been operating under bankruptcy court protection for more than two years while it struggles to find a formula to cut expenses and pay creditors. The company said fourth-quarter results were hurt by a $ 33.8 million charge relating to medical and life insurance benefits. It said other factors contributing to the fourth-quarter profit decline included a steep drop in aerospace and defense earnings, absence of operating income from the <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, steel facility it sold last June and exclusion of results for the steel bar division, which will be sold. For the quarter, after-tax profit totaled $ 95.3 million, or 67 cents per share, compared with $ 140.6 million, or $ 1.01 per share, in 1987. Fourth-quarter revenue fell 16.1 percent to $ 1.67 billion from $ 1.99 billion a year earlier. The company's huge 1988 loss contrasts to a profit of $ 502.6 million, or $ 3.67 a share, in the previous year. Revenue for the year fell 3 percent to $ 7.32 billion from $ 7.58 billion in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> officials said the annual loss resulted in part from Chapter 11-related, non-cash special charges of $ 1.35 billion taken earlier in 1988. It also included a one-time, non-cash charge of $ 2.26 billion taken in the third quarter for what the company anticipates will be its potential liability in health insurance costs of 118,000 current and retired employees. `` While special charges led to a net loss, overall operating results continued to show a positive trend,'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hay </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive. `` They demonstrate that <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>'s businesses are sound and that the company is taking the right steps to make its operations efficient and competitive `` The deferral of interest, pension and other costs while in Chapter 11 continues to be the major factor contributing to positive results,'' <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> said. `` However, strong demand for steel and improved steel prices were also important contributors for both the quarter and the year.''

<TEXT>
 Despite some reservations, securities analysts generally applauded President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s announcement Monday of a savings and loan industry bailout plan that includes higher federal insurance premiums for banks as well as thrifts. `` It's something the whole system can live with,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Sutro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said of the deposit insurance premium hike, a key part of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal. Under <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan, the higher premiums would be used to help pay the interest on $ 50 billion in bonds to finance the bailout of insolvent thrifts. `` It's a big dollar figure, but it's an enormous industry _ the effect on individual depositors or homebuyers is n't going to be enough for them to notice signficantly,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bortel </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said `` the premiums that are being increased are very small _ it does n't raise much more money each year from savings instiutions.'' `` It does n't seem to be onerous for the S & amp; Ls,'' he said. But <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Marks </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> SNL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hoboken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said the proposed increase could force some shaky thrifts over the edge. `` They ca n't afford to pay as much as they are now,'' Marks said. `` To increase them ... could force thrifts that would otherwise have survived into insolvency.'' The analysts said banks and thrifts could be expected to pass on at least a portion of their costs to consumers, possibly in the form of lower interest rates on savings accounts or in higher service or loan charges. But the analysts did not expect depositors to withdraw money from S & amp; Ls because of the possibility they might ultimately pay for the higher premiums. `` With the rise in short-term interest rates, money market funds are extremely attractive right now,'' <PERSON> Marks </PERSON> said. `` People are looking at what they can get, but it has nothing to do with this.'' Analysts said people who are concerned about the safety of their money will leave it in thrifts because those deposits are federally-insured while money market funds are not, making them slightly riskier. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also recommended combining the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> which insures deposits at thrifts, with the insurance fund for banks, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, while keeping each agency's funds separate. The president proposed regulatory changes, including steps to reduce the type of risky investments that got the industry into difficulty. He also suggested that insolvent savings and loan institutions be placed under the joint control of the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>. `` You have a much larger staff they can work with at the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, some of them quite experienced in real estate,'' a trouble spot for many thrifts, <PERSON> Sutro </PERSON> said. Overall, the analysts were pleased that the government was trying to end the thrift crisis, which has seen hundreds of S & amp; Ls forced into insolvency. But, said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, `` To some degree, it's almost too little too late.'' Most of the problems that led to thrift bailouts _ such as mismanagement or fraud at some institutions and the economic depression in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> _ have already happened, he said. However, the plan should be `` more expeditious in solving the current problems,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Bortel </PERSON> called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposals a step in the right direction but said they did not provide enough money for the hundreds of savings institutions that still are short of funds.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposed rescue package for the savings and loan industry, while praised as a good starting point, raised immediate questions on Monday concerning the huge burden being placed on taxpayers. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the financial industry said the plan is likely to be substantially modified before winningcongressional approval although officials gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> credit for moving quickly to address the crisis. `` The president deserves credit for at least putting a plan on the table,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION> and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` He faced up to a difficult problem that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spent a year ducking.'' Senate Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal `` gives us a starting point. We'll probably have a lot of people who do n't like this plan.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> himself raised questions about the amount of the tab taxpayers will be asked to shoulder. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget director, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, estimated that the cost in direct taxpayer funds would amount to $ 39.9 billion over the next 10 years. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> called that figure `` a little high. It would begin to crowd some of these other programs <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wants, like education, the environment. ...

The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that it was glad that the nation's banks were not being asked to pay to resolve the S & amp; L crisis. `` The burden to fund this crisis will fall largely on the savings and loans, themselves, where it belongs,'' said C.G. <PERSON> Holthus </PERSON>, president-elect of the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are encouraged that apparently banks and their customers will not be asked to bail out the S & amp; Ls.'' <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> appeared at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s news conference where the plan was unveiled and in a statement issued later expressed support for the proposal. `` This comprehensive package of measures to strengthen the thrift industry, and depository institutions generally, should assure that the problems that occurred in the savings and loans will not happen again,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said in a statement. Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he was withholding judgment on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal until it was analyzed. But he praised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> `` for their sensitivity to the seriousness of the problem and for presenting, under pressure, a formal proposal worthy of careful and most serious consideration.'' Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, promised to move the legislation quickly `` I think the proposal is by and large a sensible proposal,'' he said. `` I think the structural reforms make sense'' and the proposed changes in the law would `` put an end to the excessive practices'' that have led so many S & amp; Ls to failure. But <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> said the taxpayer cost was `` a substantial amount of money.'' He said he was concerned federal programs such as fighting drugs and helping education not be hurt as a result. Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, praised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and said he supported the solution, even though any answer to a $ 50 billion problem was n't something you'd want to embrace and `` kiss on the mouth. `` I think you're going to see some real bipartisanship here,'' he said. `` I think we have a reasonable proposal before us.'' Rep. <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, R-Miss., said he had some questions on specifics, such as including credit unions in the premium increases, but believed `` the major portion of it will fly. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFalce </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a member of the banking committee, said he had some concerns but overall the plan was praiseworthy. `` There is no solution without cost and without pain,'' he said. `` This plan tries to ensure that both are fairly shared.''

 Employees of two companies battling hostile takeover bids from out-of-state pursuers have banded together and on Monday appealed to Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for help, but he told them his options are restricted. The governor said an important reason he could not make a stronger commitment to <ORGANIZATION> Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, two important <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> employers, was that both companies are incorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, though they have their headquarters in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Nevertheless, he said, they deserve <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' protection `` What a state can do is limited legally,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told 2,500 employees of Prime at its headquarters. Both Polaroid and Prime face hostile corporate takeovers launched by smaller firms seeking to borrow hundreds of millions to finance the transactions. Last week a group called PACT, <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Takeovers </ORGANIZATION>, was formed by employees of Prime and <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>. Members of the group said Monday they are trying to expand to other companies that are facing takeover battles. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> drew thunderous applause from the crowd in what sounded like one of his presidential campaign speeches. `` I'm a free enterpriser, I'm an entrepreneur,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` But there also have to be some reasonable rules of the game.'' `` How can you spend your time thinking about what you're going to do for your company when you're not even sure whether the company is going to exist in a couple of years?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. The governor said he plans to go to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Wednesday and will lobby for federal legislation that would change tax laws that encourage debt-financed takeovers, sometimes called leveraged buyouts. `` As the phenomenon of hostile, highly leveraged corporate takeovers continues, subsidized by the federal tax laws, our international competitors must be laughing all the way to the bank,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. As <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spoke in the packed atrium of Prime's suburban headquarters, with hundreds of other employees watching on closed-circuit television, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> officials were in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> seeking to block the takeover of their company. Attorneys for the instant photography giant sought an injunction against <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> arguing that the pursuer has been making false statements about <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s current ecponomic strength. Prime, meanwhile, is a week away from yet another deadline set by <ORGANIZATION> MAI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Four </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for its $ 970 million, $ 20-per-share takeover offer to buy Prime, a much larger company. Prime is scheduled to be in federal court in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Tuesday to argue its case that MAI is seeking to borrow too much _ $ 1.5 billion, according to Prime _ in its buyout bid. Monday's meeting and speech came a day after a special <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> commission on corporate takeovers issued preliminary recommendations on how the state can curb the practice. Two of the recommendations involved increased lobbying efforts in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Other proposals included forcing corporate takeover strategists to provide laid-off employees with substantial benefits and pension programs. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON>, one of the Prime employees in the audience, called it `` very encouraging,'' for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to visit, `` regardless of whether there's any weight behind it.'' Prime employs 5,000 people in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> employs about 8,000, company spokesmen said. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, representing Prime employees, said a takeover by <ORGANIZATION> MAI </ORGANIZATION> would hurt the company's ability to compete overseas. Prime is the leading seller of computer aided design-computer aided manufacture systems in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and second worldwide, according to company spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasquarosa </PERSON>, representing <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> employees, said the stakes could not be higher since both companies are in danger of being absorbed through takeovers and disappearing in their current form.

 <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of the largest thrift institution based in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, announced Monday it has agreed to be acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trustco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> for about $ 212 million. Under the deal, <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trustco </ORGANIZATION> will pay $ 27 cash for each share of <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> common stock. <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> stock, which trades in the over-the-counter market, zoomed $ 7.25 a share Monday, closing at $ 22.62 after reaching a peak of $ 23. <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> First </LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, is the parent of <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION>. It has 105 offices in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 18.3 million, or $ 2.41 a share, in 1988. It lists assets totaling $ 6.6 billion. The deal requires regulatory and shareholder approval, but the company does not anticipate any trouble winning those, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The companies hope to consummate the merger in six to nine months, he said. No approvals are required in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> said. Under the merger agreement, <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> would operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trustco </ORGANIZATION>, with no changes planned in name or management, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> statement. Pacific First became the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s largest thrift company in December when it acquired two ailing thrifts in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> with federal assistance. `` Over time, <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trustco </ORGANIZATION> plans to introduce further capital into <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> First </LOCATION> to facilitate expansion,'' the statement said. Royal Trustco has put no dollar limit or time schedule on capitalization and expansion plans, but <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is a likely expansion target, <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trustco </ORGANIZATION> has assets of about 100 billion Canadian dollars.

<TEXT>
 A device which lets hearing-impaired people send brief messages to portable pagers was unveiled Monday by a company that says the service will be available in 90 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities. The system uses a palm-sized electronic messaging receiver and the so-called telecommunications device for the deaf -LRB- TTD -RRB-, which is a keyboard that connects with a regular telephone to allow conversations to be typed to another TDD over phone lines. The receiver, which can hold 40 messages up to 52 characters in length, vibrates to alert the pager wearer of the message, according to <ORGANIZATION> Metrocast </ORGANIZATION>, a nationwide electronic messaging company that developed the device with the assistance of <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Metrocast </PERSON> said more than 100,000 TDDs are in use in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where there are more than 21 million hearing-impaired people. <PERSON> Metrocast </PERSON> said its paging network is installed in 90 major cities with a population in excess of 60 million. `` The TDD-Metrocast system offers unprecedented freedom to a population previously restricted by its lack of access to suitable communications tools,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Di </PERSON> <PERSON> Noto </PERSON>, president of San Diego-based <ORGANIZATION> Metrocast </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballinger </PERSON>, manager of networks and communications at <LOCATION> Gallaudet </LOCATION>, which is a school for the hearing-impaired, said the device allows him to respond more quickly to problems in his job. `` I do n't have to look for a phone and TDD or come back to the office to check for messages,'' <PERSON> Ballinger </PERSON> said. The service, which was unveiled at the Communication Networks'89 exposition and trade show, will cost from $ 59 to $ 99 monthly, depending on the frequency of use, <PERSON> Metrocast </PERSON> said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s quickness in dealing with the savings and loan crisis, which is felt most acutely in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, met with praise Monday from several of the state's troubled thrifts. `` We were pleased to hear that he -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- made a concerted effort to study the problem, to come up with a proposal and announce it today,'' said <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobler </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antonio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, one of 350 thrifts the president's plan is designed to help. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called for an increase in the insurance premium banks and savings and loans pay on deposits and more money for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> to pursue fraud in the thrift industry. The plan does not include a fee on depositors, but the increased cost of insurance for deposits likely will be passed on to consumers in the form of lower interest rates on savings accounts. `` We like the fact that it's not hitting the consumer directly,'' said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gibraltar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> FSB </ORGANIZATION>, the giant thrift recently formed through the consolidation of five <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> savings and loans. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gibraltar </ORGANIZATION> viewed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan as a move in a `` positive direction,'' but added the company's officers were still looking it over. First <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> was formed in one of the largest consolidations of the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plan </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s program to cleanse the thrift industry of its most troubled institutions through a series of consolidations and recapitalizations. At the <ORGANIZATION> FHLBB </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> office, a focal point for administration of much of the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plan </LOCATION>, spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Colgren </PERSON> said, `` I really ca n't comment on the president's plan until we've had a chance to look at it.'' <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> Savings' Cobler praised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s assurance that deposits in the nation's thrifts are safe. `` We are pleased that he, very strongly at the beginning and end of the press conference, spoke of the full faith and credit of government behind thrifts,'' <PERSON> Cobler </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cobler </PERSON> said employees of his thrift in recent weeks have noted `` a lot of confusion by the consumer.'' `` They do n't necessarily know the full story about what's happening to savings and loans,'' he said `` They're concerned about taxes, they see headlines about failed institutions _ what we hear from our customer is that there's a lot of confusion out there.''

 Consumers are n't likely to see cuts in the interest they earn on their savings if President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan to bail out the savings and loan industry is enacted, top executives of several <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> thrifts said Monday. That's because the thrift industry faces too much competition _ from within, and from banks and securities brokers _ to risk scaring away depositors by passing along a proposed increase in federal deposit insurance premiums. `` When people say, ` Are they going to pass this premium on to the public?' I have to laugh,'' said <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're not a cost-plus industry. We're going to have to eat it.'' Top officers at four other big <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> thrifts _ Great Western, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Federal, <ORGANIZATION> Glendale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> and Home Federal _ said they, too, were extremely unlikely to cut their interest rates for fear of losing depositors to banks, mutual funds or the stock market. All five thrifts are among the nation's 10 largest. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Adelizzi </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Loan of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, said it is inevitable that higher insurance bills would be taken out of thrifts' profits, rather that passed on in the form of lower interest rates and higher fees to depositors. `` If we were a monopoly, yes, but we're not,'' <PERSON> Adelizzi </PERSON> said. `` We're competing with a broad variety of investment alternatives and it's real hard for us to just raise our rates or lower our rates.'' The S & amp; L executives reserved judgment on parts of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal, but were generally supportive of the plan, which would split the burden of bailing out failing thrifts among taxpayers and the industry itself. The president's plan would finance thrift bailouts with a combination of government bond sales _ with tax money financing the interest _ and increased premiums paid by both S & amp; Ls and banks for their federal insurance. The fact that both banks and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls would pay higher insurance premiums inevitably would force down interest rates paid to consumers, said <PERSON> J.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinola </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorp </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s biggest banks. He called the decision unfair. `` I'm somewhat appalled and looking for the right word to describe why someone in another industry that had nothing to do with the mistakes of the first industry now is being asked to pay,'' <PERSON> Pinola </PERSON> said. `` It's simply a bashing of the banks.'' In general, thrift executives praised the new president for quickly tackling a problem that many have seen as a crisis for four years. `` I like what is see,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Beverly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` I think he's showing some leadership, saying, ` We've got to get on with this problem,' and spreading the pain around a little bit.'' <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> and other thrift executives were particularly supportive of proposals to increase capital requirements _ the amount of a thrift's own money that must be used to back deposits _ and to crack down on fraud and mismanagement. That is because many at strong thrifts believe they unfairly have received a black eye through association with the estimated one-third of the industry that's on shaky ground.

<HEAD>Management Offers To Buy Formica</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A management group has offered $ 230.4 million to buy <ORGANIZATION> Formica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the target of a brief takeover attempt last fall. A group including <ORGANIZATION> Formica </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Langone </PERSON> and the investment banking firms of <ORGANIZATION> Dillon </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Wertheim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schroder </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it would pay $ 18 a share in cash for the 12.8 million shares outstanding. But <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, businessman whose offer of $ 20 a share in cash and securities was rebuffed last fall, said he was considering a new bid. <PERSON> Formica </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operations are based in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. A leading maker of high pressure decorative laminates, the company employs about 800 people at its suburban Reading, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, facilities. <PERSON> Formica </PERSON>, headquartered in <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said Monday that its directors approved a definitive merger with the management-led group. But they also told financial advisers <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> to see if others might be interested in bidding. <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> said he was incensed at management's buyout attempt. `` I'm shocked that they'd offer $ 18 when we were willing to pay $ 20 a share. I do n't think they're acting in the best interests of shareholders,'' he said. He estimated the company is worth `` in the high twenties'' a share. <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON>, who owns television stations, nursing homes and real estate, dropped his bid in November after <PERSON> Langone </PERSON> said the company was n't for sale. Under the merger agreement, the management group will launch a tender offer for all <ORGANIZATION> Formica </ORGANIZATION>'s shares, beginning Friday. After Monday's news, <PERSON> Formica </PERSON> opened above $ 20 a share on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Settlement Rate Could Lead To Payment Delays From Asbestos Trust</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The trust fund set up by <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to compensate asbestos victims could run out of money by later this year, causing delays in payments to thousands of claimants, according to trust officials and attorneys. The fund is running out of money because settlement payments have averaged about 50 percent higher, and settlements have been reached at a quicker rate, than expected when the fund was established, according to court documents and officials quoted in Tuesday's editions of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> `` It's not as bleak a situation as it appears,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Austern </PERSON>, the trust's general counsel. `` But if we run out of money, it means that we will be temporarily unable to make payments.'' <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> sought Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy protection from creditors in 1982 due to thousands of claims from people who suffered illnesses because of contact with asbestos. The trust, which assumes all legal liability for personal injury lawsuits stemming from <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION>'s asbestos products, was created last year when the company emerged from Chapter 11. Trust officials have indicated they had received 40,000 notices of claims and estimate that 120,000 to 200,000 claims ultimately could be filed against the trust, the newspaper stated. Court documents and people involved in <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION>'s legal proceedings indicated that the trust in recent months had agreed to settle almost 14,000 claims averaging $ 38,000 each. Creators of the trust had estimated claims would average $ 25,000. In a report recently filed in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bankruptcy court in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> trustees stated they expected that in the third or fourth quarter of this year, `` the trust will recurringly find itself temporarily unable to pay claimants.'' Trust officials told the Times they could not predict how long payments might be delayed. The trust is to be replenished periodically over 27 years by the sale of stock, note payments and injections of <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> profits, mostly after 1982. The fund currently has $ 685 million in assets and more than $ 665 million in liabilities, according to <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamhi </PERSON>, the trust's director of communications. The trust's total value was expected to exceed $ 2.5 billion over its life. Separately, Denver-based <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday that it lost $ 1.31 billion in the fourth quarter because of a $ 1.3 billion charge for costs of its Chapter 11 reorganization. The loss compared with a $ 59.98 million loss in fourth quarter 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> reported fourth-quarter sales of $ 522.1 million, up from $ 486 million a year earlier. For the full year, <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> lost nearly $ 1.3 billion, compared to earnings of $ 72.6 million, or 61 cents per share, in 1987. Full-year sales totaled $ 2.06 billion, up from $ 1.94 billion.
