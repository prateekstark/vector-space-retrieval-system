 A British frigate collided with a Canadian support ship Sunday during <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> maneuvers off <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> said. A ministry spokesman said there were no injuries in the collision between the HMS <PERSON> Penelope </PERSON> and the Canadian vessel Preserver. He said the Preserver was not damaged and would continue to take part in the exercise. The <PERSON> Penelope </PERSON> headed for <LOCATION> Rosyth </LOCATION> on the Scottish east coast, where the extent of the damage would be determined. The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the collision took place during a refueling operation about 7 a.m. -LRB- 1 a.m. EDT -RRB- Sunday in <LOCATION> Vestfjorden </LOCATION>, the waterway between the <LOCATION> Lofoten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and the northwest Norwegian coast. <PERSON> Penelope </PERSON> is a 3,200-ton Leander class warship with 230 officers and crew. The much larger Preserver, 24,700 tons, has a complement of 290 and is mainly used for refueling other ships at sea. The vessels were taking part in Teamwork'88, a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> exercise involving 45,000 land, sea and air personnel of the armed forces of nine <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries, 340 aircraft and 200 ships. The exercise is designed to test naval warfare, air force collaboration, anti-submarine, carrier and convoy operations and amphibious landings. The exercise began Aug. 31 and runs through Sept. 21. Sunday's collision was the second reported in nine days to a British warship. The destroyer HMS <ORGANIZATION> Southampton </ORGANIZATION> was rammed and badly damaged Sept. 3 in the Gulf of <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> by the British container ship Tor Bay it was protecting. Eleven sailors on the destroyer were injured, three having broken bones, but no one was hurt on the much larger merchantman.

An estimated 55,000 people fled into neighboring <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION> to escape the violence that claimed 5,000 lives, according to government estimates.

The Tutsis comprise only 15 percent of <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>'s population of 5 million but control the tiny central African nation's government and army. About 84 percent of the population are Hutus. Some <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> refugees in <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION> have said Hutus initiated the killings by attacking Tutsis in <LOCATION> Ntega </LOCATION> but soldiers were responsible for most of the massacres that spread into <PERSON> Marangara </PERSON>. They said the troops began killing Hutus in reprisal for the slain Tutsis. <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>'s government has acknowledged its military forces became involved but claims soldiers killed fewer than a dozen people and restored peace in the area by Aug. 17. The two tribes are longtime enemies. Following a Hutu-led coup attempt in the former <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> colony in 1972 the Tutsi massacred an estimated 100,000 Hutus.

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Snow dusted parts of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday, giving firefighters a break in their battle against forest fires, and people evacuated from park headquarters and several towns returned home. Federal officials said they would double the number of soldiers sent to battle the fires that have charred more than a third of the 2.2 million-acre park. After months of drought and heat, temperatures only reached the mid-30s Sunday, with humidity as high as 90 percent. Some sections of the park were dampened by light showers Saturday. `` The colder temperatures are going to raise the humidity and with the higher humidity, the wood will absorb some of that moisture. It'll be less likely to burn, although the fire should n't have much trouble,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Halliday </PERSON>, chief naturalist for the <LOCATION> west </LOCATION> district of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> Winds were expected to stay in a more manageable range of 15 to 30 mph, well below the gusts above 50 mph that had driven the flames the previous two days. Fires have charred 883,000 acres of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> since June in what firefighters call the worst fire season in the West in 30 years. About 80 Canadian air crew members hired to help drop fire retardant arrived in <ORGANIZATION> Coeur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> D'alene </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, for training. Light snow and low temperatures also helped firefighters in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, where wind gusted to 60 mph, and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, where evacuated residents of some ranches and small communities were allowed to return home. Rain and lower temperatures dampened fires in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, but 45 mph wind gusts whipped a <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> fire to 1,830 acres and led six families to evacuate. Heavy rains later Sunday stalled the fire and residents were allowed to return home. Fires in the <ORGANIZATION> Routt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> were left unattended because the weather was too cold and wet for firefighters. And in northwest <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> shut down millions of acres of state-protected forests in an unprecedented effort to curb the number of fires caused by human carelessness. `` Given the number of human-caused fires we're seeing every day, this is the most viable option we have right now,'' said forestry department spokesman <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>. Altogether, 13.3 million acres, or 83 percent of the state's forests, have been closed, <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> said A fire also burned in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where a mountain blaze whipped by hot winds burned 2,000 acres of brush and timber near the town of <LOCATION> Grass </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. There were no reports of injuries, but authorities described the blaze as a wall of fire a half-mile long that was headed toward affluent <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wildwood </LOCATION>, a residential area of about 2,000 homes. And in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a rapidly expanding fire started by an illegal campfire spread rapidly to more than 300 acres in Olympic National Park high country Sunday. Thin smoke from the <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> fires has drifted as far east as <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> at an altitude of 15,000 to 20,000 feet, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday. `` A couple days ago most of the smoke was over the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and it has now gradually drifted eastward,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Severe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Storms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. `` It's just going to have a thin hazy appearance and might create some colorful sunsets, but it's not expected to present any health problems because it's so far up.'' The 263,400-acre North Fork fire in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> remained about a mile from park headquarters at <LOCATION> Mammoth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobias </PERSON>. That fire also has threatened <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, and destroyed several buildings at Old Faithful geyser. Park officials Saturday ordered all families and nonessential employees to leave Mammoth, near the park's north entrance. But they were allowed back after conditions improved. <PERSON> Tobias </PERSON> did not know how many people decided to return. The improved weather allowed park officials to reopen <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s west entrance and the road from there to <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Junction </LOCATION> and Old Faithful. The rest of the park remained closed to visitors. Ten miles northeast of Mammoth, residents of <LOCATION> Jardine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, also were allowed to return, <PERSON> Tobias </PERSON> added. They were evacuated Saturday when fire threatened the only exit road. Evacuated residents of <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Silver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gate </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, at the northeast gate to <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>, were allowed to return home Sunday and the highway leading into the area was reopened, said fire information officer <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Tafoya </PERSON>. A mile from <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters, firefighters sprayed protective foam Sunday on buildings at the <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adult </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> camp, where fire destroyed a tent. `` Basically with this cold front that's moved in it's going to put us kind of in a holding pattern. We'll see how it goes from there,'' <PERSON> Tobias </PERSON> said. `` Let's just drop this wind and we'll be in business.'' However, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, said: `` It's not going to be with us too long. We expect warmer weather and a drying trend this week.'' About 9,000 people are fighting the fires in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>. Deputy Defense Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> <PERSON> IV </PERSON> said 1,200 Marines from <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pendleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and two <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> battalions will join the 2,300 <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, fighting the fires. `` So by the end of next week, we will see a doubled representation by the military in this effort,'' <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> said.

 The struggle for civil rights remains alive, although it has changed, says one of several activists honored for their work in the 1960s. `` The nature and the character of the movement has changed, but these changes are merely part of a natural process and do not spell doom for our hopes,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, D-Ga., former chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, who received an honorary doctorate at a convocation Saturday opening <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>'s 196th academic year, said the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people must elect leaders with the `` moral capacity'' of the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> if civil rights are to improve with time. `` We have lost some of our finest leaders, but we are still very involved in that same movement for liberation,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, who was jailed 40 times and severely beaten during the Sixties for leading peaceful marches and demonstrations throughout the South. `` Our struggle is not for one day, or one week, or one year, but for a lifetime if that's what it takes.''

 A record 916 people tackled <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> McKinley </LOCATION> during the mountaineering season, says the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which is thinking about putting another outhouse on <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s tallest mountain. Sanitation on the 20,320-foot mountain has been a growing concern, said <PERSON> Ranger </PERSON> <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. According to <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 562 of the 916 people who registered to climb <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON> this spring and summer reported reaching the summit. Last year, 817 climbers tested themselves against the mountain. Only about a third finished the climb. Two people died climbing <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON> this year, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, a 71-year-old <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> lawyer, this year became the oldest person known to have made the top. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> attributed some of the increased mountaineering to foreigners who decided attractive currency exchange rates made this the year for the climb they had long wanted to make. Climbers began arriving in April and some waited until late July, but most planned their trips for May and June. `` We're trying to get more people to come in July,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. Rangers attempting to deal with the environmental effects of increased activity want use of the mountain to be spread out. The Park Service asks climbers to use plastic bags for human waste and put the bags in crevasses, but officials do n't know how many comply, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. There are two latrines on <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON>, one two-thirds of the way up the peak. The <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> hopes to install an outhouse at 17,000 feet next year.

<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s customary message of peace and reconciliation could be a controversial one when he visits <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, a southern African nation wracked by 12 years of civil war, drought and systematic destruction of public facilities. A newsletter issued last year by <ORGANIZATION> Frelimo </ORGANIZATION>, the governing Marxist party, called the former <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> colony's <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops `` enemies of the people'' after they suggested the government meet with guerrillas of the Mozambican National Resistance. But Cardinal <PERSON> Alexandre </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> says he hopes the pope will call for reconciliation when he visits the country Sept. 16-19. President <PERSON> Joaquim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON>, who was visiting the pope in the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> when the bishops made their plea, said it was impossible to negotiate with the guerrillas who, he charged, mutilate children, burn schools and hospitals, and massacre villagers. The guerrilla movement, known as <ORGANIZATION> RENAMO </ORGANIZATION>, denies such charges and says it is fighting to replace the Marxist government with a democratic one. `` We hope -LRB- the pope -RRB- will say something about peace since we are in this situation of war,'' said <PERSON> Dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, who became a cardinal in June. `` We do n't see how we can end this struggle without reconciliation. ... It is necessary to have dialogue with these people.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pascoal </PERSON> <PERSON> Mocumbi </PERSON> said the government hopes the pope will not appeal for negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> RENAMO </ORGANIZATION>. He said no one had the right to suggest that the government `` should talk with terrorists, with those who commit massacres, ... those who have been roundly condemned, not only by <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> but by the international community.'' Job Chambal, director of the government's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, is overseeing the return of some church property confiscated when <ORGANIZATION> Frelimo </ORGANIZATION> came to power at independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1975. He said of the bishops: `` Our quarrel with them is not the fact that they called for negotiations _ any <LOCATION> Mozambican </LOCATION> is free to think that. The one thing that worried the government was to ... say that the government as well as <ORGANIZATION> RENAMO </ORGANIZATION> are responsible for the war.'' <PERSON> Chambal </PERSON> said the plan to return all confiscated church property used for worship came coincidentally three months before the pope's visit `` We were not trying to please the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>,'' he said. `` It's a way of showing we do n't belong to an evil empire.'' Since 1982, when the late President <PERSON> Samora </PERSON> <PERSON> Machel </PERSON> held meetings with church leaders, the government has sought to ease tension between the churches and <ORGANIZATION> Frelimo </ORGANIZATION>. The government invited the pope to visit <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> in his capacity as head of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> state, and it is sharing expenses with the local church. `` It's very expensive, but it's very important,'' Chambal said. `` The willingness of the pope to come to <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> means there's been a very big improvement because people have understood what it means when we say we have a socialist state. `` We are Marxists, but all of us in government have some religious background,'' said <PERSON> Chambal </PERSON>, who was reared a Presbyterian. `` We still have some religious feeling. Even our revolutionary songs have a religious taste. But our children will be more Marxist, and teach their children to be Marxists.'' He said the government wants children to be influenced only by the state until they are 18, when they can choose whether to go to church, but this policy is not enforced. In the years immediately after independence, some churches were closed, services were interrupted and religious activity was officially discouraged. Now churches operate freely. Both cathedral services and prayer meetings in the <PERSON> bush </PERSON> are packed on Sundays. The Frelimo revolutionaries accused Roman Catholic bishops and priests of cooperating with the Portuguese colonial government and opposing independence in return for a favored position as a state church. The cardinal says some Portuguese clergymen supported colonialism, but denies the <ORGANIZATION> Mozambican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> as a whole was against independence. All church-state problems are not resolved, Cardinal <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> said, but he maintained the government does not understand the church's goals. `` They suppose we want only to teach those who want to be religious leaders,'' he said. `` We also want to prepare the people for running the country.'' <PERSON> Dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> said that of <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s 14.5 million people, 2 million are Catholics.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The floor no longer moves beneath <PERSON> Tania </PERSON> <PERSON> Aebi </PERSON>'s feet The view from her window these days offers more than a vista of waves and billowing sail. And she no longer spends week after week alone. Life has changed for the young woman whose father sent her off at age 18 to sail alone around the world because she would n't do her homework. Instead of standing by the tiller, Ms. <PERSON> Aebi </PERSON> now spends hours in front of her computer keyboard, putting down the memories of months at sea and ports of call. But after working nearly a year on her book, Ms. <PERSON> Aebi </PERSON> still finds `` writing about myself is harder than sailing.'' The lessons of her 2 -LCB- - year, 27,000-mile voyage are coming slowly `` I'm ruminating about it,'' Ms. <PERSON> Aebi </PERSON>, now 21, said recently from her home in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION> `` It's not like my life's a neat pattern yet. It probably never will be.'' Nonetheless, her life is starting to follow a more conventional path. The boat recently was sold. She's newly wed to a man she met on the other side of the planet. And Ms. <PERSON> Aebi </PERSON> and her father have bridged the personal gulf that sent her sailing around the globe. `` Before I left, he lost hope in me,'' she confided. `` He thought I was a total dud. He was an explorer and I did none of that. `` Father proposed the whole thing to me and did n't give me a whole lot of options.'' In 1985, <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Aebi </PERSON>, a well-known surrealist painter who lives in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, suggested to his bicycle-messenger daughter an intriguing scheme: In lieu of a college education, he would buy her a boat to sail solo around the world. Ms. <PERSON> Aebi </PERSON>, a difficult student who graduated from an alternative high school, agreed. Her father says she was `` shanghaied.'' Soon, the 26-foot sloop <LOCATION> Varuna </LOCATION> was ordered, and on May 28, 1985, the neophyte sailor hoisted the sails and was on her way out of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. Many thought she would n't make it. But by the time Ms. <PERSON> Aebi </PERSON> floated through the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> and reached the <LOCATION> Galapagos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> she had learned how to use the heavens as her map. Her seamanship would later be tested when the boat capsized during a <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> storm and when it collided with a freighter. At the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Aebi </PERSON> gave a hitchhiker an 80-mile lift to another island, a generous oversight that ultimately cost her a pair of world's records. The people who keep the books say as a result of that gesture, the voyage could n't be classified as single-handed. Ms. <PERSON> Aebi </PERSON> would have been the youngest person and the first <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> woman to sail solo around the world. But if she lost something in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, she also found something: <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> <PERSON> Berner </PERSON>, a fellow adventurer and solo sailor from <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> who was sailing to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> in search of gold. He changed course and, sailing his own boat, accompanied her to <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. When Ms. <PERSON> Aebi </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> last Nov. 6, <PERSON> Berner </PERSON> was here to welcome her. The couple were married six months later. With the elation of accomplishment now displaced by the effort of writing her memoirs, Ms. <PERSON> Aebi </PERSON> says she has no regrets about the records she almost captured or the years away from her home, friends and family. `` I'll never be 18 again,'' she said. `` That trip gave me an opportunity for 2 -LCB- years to not worry about the future except for getting to the next port. I knew what I had to do, which was ultimately get back to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' But, does the prosaic pale after a life before the mast? `` Life ca n't be a bore when you have a deadline,'' she said with a laugh. `` And there are too many things I want to do _ learn a couple of more languages, read a lot of books and get older.'' Still, her future remains `` a big question mark.'' `` I've seen a lot and I've met a lot of people doing different things, so I see there's a whole world of opportunity out there. I guess I have bigger horizons.'' Ms. <PERSON> Aebi </PERSON>'s next adventure will be a more conventional drive across the country in a van with her husband. Another solo voyage does n't figure into her plans, but neither does settling down. `` I could have bought a house last week,'' she said. `` But when it came down to paying the mortgage and being attached to one particular thing, I just could n't do it. I do n't need a house. I could get a boat.''

 The remnants of Hurricane <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> pushed inland Saturday as thousands of <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> residents returned home, happy to find little damage from 80 mph winds and sheets of rain. `` I was expecting to see my little trailer gone. It is n't tied down or anything,'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, 58, said as he hauled away a 12-foot-long branch that had fallen from a tree next to his undamaged trailer house in <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>, near the mouth of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. One death _ that of an <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> man who drowned Friday trying to secure a boat against the rising winds _ was linked to the storm, which was downgraded to a tropical depression by dawn Saturday. `` All we lost was a good night's sleep,'' said <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Guice </PERSON>, civil defense director for <LOCATION> Harrison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, Miss. `` This storm fizzled out. The hurricane did n't come.'' Meanwhile, Tropical Storm <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> formed in the eastern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and strengthened into a hurricane Saturday night. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> reported its position late Saturday night as near latitude 16.0 north, longitude 67.3 west, about 225 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Domingo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Maximum sustained winds were estimated to be nearly 75 mph. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was expected drop 5 to 10 inches of rain on <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> by Sunday, the hurricane center said. <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> hit on the 23rd anniversary of Hurricane <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON>'s 1965 landfall but packed little of <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON>'s punch. <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> killed more than 70 people in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and did an estimated $ 1.1 billion in damage. Damage estimates for <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> were unavailable but appeared to be relatively minor. Crews from the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preparedness </ORGANIZATION> went out Saturday to assess the damage and start cleaning up, said state police Trooper <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>. Sheriff's deputies said property damage appeared to be minimal and limited mainly to downed power lines that knocked out electricity to 115,000 or more homes and businesses. Thousands of people ordered to leave homes in nine parishes Friday returned home when <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> dropped from hurricane to tropical storm. They found several broken branches and a few bent or broken signs. `` We were expecting the worst and hoping for the best, and we got the best out of it,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciko </PERSON>, a spokesman for the sheriff's office in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tammany </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION>, across <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pontchartrain </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. A tornado was reported in neighboring <LOCATION> Tangipahoa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the tropical depression was pushing a wide band of showers and thunderstorms into northeast <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, extreme southwest <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and central <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. At 5 p.m. CDT, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> was centered over central <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, moving toward the west-northwest and weakening. Winds unleashed by <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> never reached the 100 mph that had been feared. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Tregre </PERSON>, a spokesman for the two companies that supply electricity to most of south <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, said the storm cut power to about 70,000 <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> customers and about 33,000 customers of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. About 6,900 remained without power Saturday afternoon, but <PERSON> Tregre </PERSON> said he expected all would have their electricity restored before Sunday <PERSON> Ciko </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> officials told him that 12,000 to 14,000 customers were without power at the height of the storm. Although the storm was expected to bring 5 to 10 inches of rain, less than 2 inches was reported around most of southeast <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. `` The fast movement of the storm kept a lid on the rains,'' said a weather service meteorologist who refused to give his name. <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, the sixth named storm of the 1988 <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> storm season, was the second hurricane. The first, <PERSON> Debby </PERSON>, reached minimal hurricane strength briefly before hitting Mexican coast last month.

 A wealthy civic activist won an upset victory over <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>'s lieutenent governor Saturday in a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary election for the right to challenge a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> incumbent in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. With 97 percent or 330 of the 339 precincts reporting, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beard </PERSON> had 22,418 votes, or 53 percent, to Lt. Gov. S.B. Woo's 19,624 votes, or 47 percent Nine small precincts were not expected to report their results until Monday, but <PERSON> Woo </PERSON> conceded Saturday night. He apologized to his supporters for not running a winning campaign, and said in a statement, `` I always said it was a tough way to earn a living,'' according to his press secretary <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>. `` It was a wonderful victory,'' <PERSON> Beard </PERSON> said, referring to himself as the underdog in the primary campaign. `` We ran a grassroots campaign from the beginning. We went into living rooms, all over the state. We walked through 19 pairs of shoes.'' Beard faces Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in the November general election. <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, who did not have a primary opponent, is seeking a fourth term. The votes represented a little more than a 30 percent turnout of Democrats eligible to vote in the only statewide race in the primary, according to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, state election commissioner. There were 133,386 Democrats eligible to vote, and average turnout for a primary is about 20 percent. Two Beard campaign workers were detained Saturday night after an officer caught them taking down about 50 Woo signs throughout <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> before dawn Saturday, police said. Authorities planned to charge the men with theft and conspiracy, but a Woo assistant asked that no charges be filed, police said. There was no indication Beard had ordered the signs destroyed. `` They took them back to the New Castle Armory Building where <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Beard </PERSON>'s headquarters are located, and they were putting them into a dumpster there when a town resident called to report the incident,'' New Castle Police Sgt. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> said.

 Woo, 51, born in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, had the financial support of Asian-American communities, for whom he has become a champion nationwide. Woo, a physics professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION>, was a political newcomer four years ago when he beat two legislators in a primary, then went on to win the lieutenant governor's seat by a slim 479 votes. Beard, 49, who inherited his wealth, had the support of party leaders and loyalists, as well as unions. He is a former staffer of the late <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, and runs a nonprofit company that helps attract grants and designs plans to attract economic development. Beard was far outspent by Woo. Campaign finance reports filed in late August showed Woo with $ 407,998 on hand. Beard had only $ 65,008. <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> had $ 734,933. Woo's ethnic background was targeted recently in an open letter supporting Beard that was written by <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> `` Pete'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, president of the state <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>. The letter said in part: `` It is up to you and I to save this country not only from the Asian influences the lieutenant governor refers to, but all foreign influence.'' Last week, <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> wrote another letter, apologizing to anyone who might have been offended by the statement. <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said he was referring to Woo's claims that he has many contact with business leaders in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>.

 Miss Minnesota <PERSON> Gretchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, who wants to be a Harvard-trained lawyer, became the first classical violinist to win the Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> crown in a contest that required two polls of the judges Saturday night. Miss <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> erupted in tears as her name was announced as Miss America 1989. She laughed and cried as she took her victory walk along the runway at Convention Center. The first runner-up was Miss Colorado <PERSON> Maya </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Vail </LOCATION>; the second runner-up was Miss <PERSON> Oklahoma </PERSON> <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>, 23, of <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>; the third runner-up was Miss <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <PERSON> Marlise </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricardos </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION>; and the fourth runner-up was <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Alabama </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION>. Miss <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Anoka </LOCATION>, is a senior at the prestigious <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, majoring in organizational behavior. As part of her studies, she spent a semester at <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. She plans to attend <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm not a beauty queen. I aspire to go to <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. This is not just for someone who is beautiful. This is for someone who is educated and sophisticated,'' Miss <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> told reporters after winning. She said she felt `` shocked inside. I'm trying to remain composed on the outside.'' Asked about the first thing she wanted to do, she replied, `` Eat pizza. That's all I can think about.'' The 5-foot-3, 108-pound Miss <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> impressed judges with a spirited violin piece titled `` Gypsy Airs.'' The piece started slow and moving, then jumped into a splashy, fast-paced beat. Miss <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, who attended the pageant, said his daughter is `` a winner. Everything she does she gives 110 percent. She does n't like to lose.'' Her mother, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, added: `` I think it feels wonderful. She said she knew she could win.'' But getting Miss <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>'s name from the judges was not easy. As television host <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> walked to the judge's area in front of the stage to learn who had won, he was told there was a tie. It later turned out to be a tie for second and third places. In an affort to kill time, <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> nervously began making small talk with the contestants. There was a flurry of activity in the judge's box. Pageant Director <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, sitting next to the judges, tapped his fingers on the edge of the stage as a discussion took place on what to do. Eventually, a second poll of the judges resulted in Miss <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> taking the coveted rhinestone-studded headpiece. During the wait, Miss <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said things were tense on stage. `` At that moment, I thought, ` Oh, it's all over,''' she said. After winning a preliminary talent competition earlier in the week, Miss <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> termed parts of her performance `` exquisite'' but vowed to do even better on the final night. She has studied the violin for 17 years. For her performance, the green-eyed blonde wore a black velvet gown with a sweetheart neckline with dramatic green lame-puffed sleeves and pleated layered skirts. Miss <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, who prides herself on being 100 percent Swedish, had taken special pains during the week to highlight her heritage. At the Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> parade on Tuesday, her hair and dress were decorated with a traditional garland of flowers. However, for the evening gown competition, Miss <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> chose a long-sleeved turquoise, beaded gown with a silver-beaded design on the bodice and back. <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, in his first year as the pageant's executive director, has stressed that the new Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will fit into a different mold than tradition previously held. `` Multi-faceted young women who are more than just physically attractive and talented'' have become the ideal, he said. `` These are dynamic young college women.'' In an effort to prove that to a national television audience Saturday night, the pageant televised video clips of the finalists' interviews that was part of preliminary judging Also, the judges on Saturday night asked an unrehearsed question of each of the top 10 finalists during the evening gown competition. The new Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> succeeds Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> 1988 <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> <PERSON> Lani </PERSON> <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafko </PERSON>, 25, an outspoken nurse from <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, who has championed AIDS education and safe sex, and preferred to make charity appearances rather than take paid engagements during the year. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> returned for his seventh year as host of the finals to croon the pageant standard `` There She Is'' to the new queen. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>' wife, <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> 1959 <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Mobley </PERSON>, co-hosted this year's pageant with the theme `` Success.'' She also joined <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> in attempting to kill network air time as the judge's tried to come up with a winner. Pageant officials said there have been a number of tie situations in years past. The 67-year-old Miss America Pageant is the largest contributor of scholarships to young women, awarding more than $ 5 million in scholarships annually to more than 80,000 young women who compete on the national, state and local levels. The new Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> receives a $ 30,000 cash scholarship and the income from a year of personal appearances. Miss <PERSON> Rafko </PERSON> estimates she earned more than $ 150,000 during her reign. The first runner-up receives a $ 17,000 scholarship and the next three runners-up receive $ 11,000, $ 8,000 and $ 6,000 in scholarships, respectively. The remaining finalists each receive $ 4,000 to be used toward their educations, and every remaining contestant receives a $ 2,000 scholarship. This year, a new judging system was introduced. The contestants were interviewed and judged in preliminary competitions by a preliminary panel of seven judges. On Saturday, a panel of 12 celebrity judges started from scratch after reviewing videos of the top 10 finalists' interviews. Saturday's celebrity judges were: actors <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dysart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> <PERSON> Underwood </PERSON> of television's `` L.A. Law''; NBC News correspondent <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Norville </PERSON>; Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> 1971 and broadcaster <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>; actor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Peppard </PERSON>; actress <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>; columnist Dr. <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Brothers </PERSON>; Olympic ice skating gold medalist <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Boitano </PERSON>; movie producer <PERSON> Lili </PERSON> <PERSON> Fini </PERSON> <PERSON> Zanuck </PERSON>; model agency founder <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>; Parade magazine publisher <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>; and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Farley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>.

 The captain of <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Flight 1141 is not well enough to talk to federal investigators about the Aug. 31 crash that killed 13 people, his physician said Saturday.

He also is recuperating from surgery on Tuesday for a fractured cheekbone. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was at the controls of the 15-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 when it crashed at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> seconds after takeoff.

 A 27-year-old man was convicted Saturday night for slaying five people and wounding two others during a supermarket robbery. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> showed no emotion as the verdict was read, but his mother and sister were in tears, as were the relatives of some victims. He was convicted of five counts of first-degree murder, two counts of first-degree assault, one count of first-degree robbery and eight counts of armed criminal action. Prosecutor <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> said he will seek the death penalty in sentencing hearings set for Tuesday. Defense attorney <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> said he would appeal the verdict. `` I ca n't second-guess what happened in the jury room,'' <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> said, noting that the jury was earlier reported to be widely split on a decision. `` They were under tremendous pressure. You never know what a jury's going to do.'' After closing arguments Friday night, the jury met for several hours, then resumed deliberations Saturday morning. The verdict came more than 15 hours later. Another suspect, <PERSON> Donnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Blankenship </PERSON>, 26, is scheduled to go on trial later. <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> maintained his client had nothing to do with the crime. He brought several witnesses to the trial in an effort to prove that police had used coercion on some of the initial suspects in the case. Investigators said <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> and <PERSON> Blankenship </PERSON> entered the National supermarket in north <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> after it had closed Sept. 4, 1987, possibly by posing as a cleaning crew.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> on Saturday bowed to massive pro-democracy protests and announced that the ruling party would relinquish its 26-year monopoly on power and hold multiparty elections. An emergency session of Parliament on Sunday approved multiparty elections in about three months and appointed a group of elders to supervise polling. But key opposition leaders pressed for more political concessions, including an interim government to cope with <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s growing chaos, and sporadic protests continued Millions of people have taken to the streets since March to call for democracy in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. The Parliament authorized the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s highest governent body, to hold elections in as early as 45 days or the postpone them beyond the tentative three-month date if necessary. It also empowered the council to make necessary changes in the constitution to reflect a multiparty system, enlarge an <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> if necessary and formulate election rules. Named to the <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> were three retired civil servants, a retired army brigadier and a former member of Parliament. All are more than 70 years old. On Saturday, speaking before 968 delegates at a special party congress, <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> acknowledged that the party made major errors and said the interests of the people were paramount. `` Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely,'' he said in a speech carried by the state-owned Radio <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. `` As members of the ruling party for a long period, they tended to forget the interests of the people and lose public confidence.'' The Western-trained lawyer pledged fair and free elections as soon as possible. He said he would not be a candidate. The broadcast announcer said the decision was unanimously adopted by the delegates of the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> urged government employees, who have gone on strike in sympathy with the massive pro-democracy movement, to return to their jobs and revive his stalled government. The government move was another retreat in face of the sometimes bloody nationwide uprising. The movement has prompted the resignation of two hard-line presidents, the lifting of martial law and virtually unimpeded political activities that earlier would have drawn long prison terms or worse. Western observers noted that the anti-government surge came without any outside support or meaningful resort to arms, although demonstrators often have compared their movement with those of other <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries. `` They were inspired by the triumph of <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> ... They were encouraged by the establishment of democracy in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> last year,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said after returning from <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> earlier last week. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> took a cautious stance. `` It's still not clear the date or the manner of the elections that would be held, or whether the government's move will satisfy the desires of the people,'' spokesman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harter </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s government originally planned to meet Monday to consider a referendum on a general election and a multiparty system. On Friday, opposition leader former prime minister <PERSON> U </PERSON> <PERSON> Nu </PERSON>, who was toppled from power in a 1962 military coup by <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>, defied <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s authoritarian rulers and declared the formation of a rival government and elections Oct. 9. But three top members of the rival goverment resigned Saturday, and reliable sources said U Nu had not consulted them about the announcement. Although U Nu, 82, is respected by a large number of Burmese, diplomats say his age makes it unlikely that he will be anything more than a `` symbol'' of continuing opposition to authoritarian diehards. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, an opposition figure and daughter of the deceased national hero <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON>, told reporters that Saturday's announcement was `` a positive step,'' but said it could take up to two years to form parties to contest in general elections `` Under the present economic and political situation, an interim government will be the best solution. It -LRB- interim government -RRB- would deal with economic problems and also hold general elections,'' she told newsmen. Many opposition figures demanded that an interim government be set up immediately. `` Every minute the economic, political and security situation deteriorates,'' one opposition lawyer said. `` Immediate formation of an interim government is the only solution. The country wo n't hold up until these general elections. Ne Win resigned as head of the ruling party in July, citing in part widespread street protests in March and June. Riots flared when the party chose as his successor <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, who is widely hated for his brutal suppression of dissidents. Troops fired into crowds of protesters, and the government said 112 people were killed. Western diplomats said the number was much higher. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> resigned Aug. 12 after 17 days in power, and <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> was named to replace him. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> was <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s first civilian leader in 26 years.

 Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> swept toward the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> Sunday, and the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> alerted its heavily populated south coast to prepare for high winds, heavy rains and high seas. The storm was approaching from the southeast with sustained winds of 75 mph gusting to 92 mph. `` There is no need for alarm,'' <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Eugenio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabral </PERSON> said in a television alert shortly before midnight Saturday. <PERSON> Cabral </PERSON> said residents of the province of <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON> should closely follow <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s movement. An estimated 100,000 people live in the province, including 70,000 in the city of <LOCATION> Barahona </LOCATION>, about 125 miles west of <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Domingo </LOCATION>. Tropical Storm <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> formed in the eastern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and strengthened into a hurricane Saturday night. The National Hurricane Center in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> reported its position at 2 a.m. Sunday at latitude 16.1 north, longitude 67.5 west, about 140 miles south of <LOCATION> Ponce </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, and 200 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Domingo </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was moving westward at 15 mph with a `` broad area of cloudiness and heavy weather'' rotating around the center of the storm. The weather service issued a flash flood watch for <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> until at least 6 p.m. Sunday. Strong winds associated with the <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> brought coastal flooding, strong southeast winds and up to 12 feet feet to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>'s south coast. There were no reports of casualties. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, on the north coast, had heavy rains and gusts Saturday, but they subsided during the night. On Saturday, Hurricane <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> was downgraded to a tropical storm and its remnants pushed inland from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. Residents returned home, happy to find little damage from 80 mph winds and sheets of rain. <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, the sixth named storm of the 1988 <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> storm season, was the second hurricane. The first, <PERSON> Debby </PERSON>, reached minimal hurricane strength briefly before hitting the Mexican coast last month.

<HEAD>Computer Firms Win Round in Legal Fight Against Air Force</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two of the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> computer manufacturers have won the first round in a fight with the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> to be reimbursed at taxpayers' expense for their legal costs in challenging <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> contracting procedures. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contract </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, in an Aug. 17 opinion obtained late last week, decided that <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Wang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> were entitled to some of the more than $ 1 million they are seeking, but did not say how much. Rather, in a partial victory for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, the board ordered the firms to `` segregate'' legal expenses incurred in pursuing the portion of the original challenge that they won, and said they could recover only those costs. If the two sides ca n't reach a settlement, the board said, additional proceedings will be held to fix the award. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> had asked the board to reject completely <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>'s claim for $ 830,330 and <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>'s demand for $ 210,000 The six-page opinion, written by Administrative Judge <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaBella </PERSON> and endorsed by two other judges, marks the latest chapter in a two-year-old battle over what has been called the computer contract of the century. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> intends to buy about 20,000 mini-computers for use by all the armed services, at cost of up to $ 4.5 billion. The contract is expected to be awarded in the next month or so. Digital and <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, like most other industry firms, expressed an interest in bidding on the contract in early 1987. But before the bidding deadline passed, they filed a challenge with the <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> board charging that the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> had rigged the competition. The companies complained specifically about a requirement the computers operate on a UNIX or UNIX-compatible program. UNIX is a proprietary system developed by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and widely licensed to other vendors. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> says UNIX compatibility is essential if the military is ever to standardize its computer systems. The <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> board, in its initial ruling last October, backed the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> for the most part, concluding that UNIX had become an industry standard. `` The decision here is not unlike a determination to specify either VHS or Beta video recorders,'' it said. But the board also said the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> should have spelled out in greater detail how it intended to use an AT & amp; T test program to determine contract compliance. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> did that in November, when it issued two pages of amendments to its solicitation before restarting the competition. Digital and <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, citing their partial victory, then filed requests for reimbursement of all legal expenses stemming from the challenge. Digital said failure to reimburse would discourage future challenges and result in `` loss of effective enforcement of the procurement laws.'' `` The loser would be competition and thus, ultimately, the taxpayer,'' the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> lawyers countered that <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> had `` lost this case'' after prevailing on a single, insignificant issue. As evidence, they pointed to the two companies's withdrawal from the competition in January. The board disagreed, saying that only after the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> corrected its solicitation were <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> able to determine whether they should compete on the government's terms. Their challenge produced the `` benefit of full and open competition, which is the touchstone and objective of procurement law,'' it said. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> said the board's decision was wrong but that the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> had not decided what to do next. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> indicated that the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and the companies had begun discussing a possible settlement, as urged by the <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> board. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> failed to return a phone call Friday.

<TEXT>
 Three members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are urging the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to abandon its plan to tear down the rustic shacks on remote dunes of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, that have inspired artists and authors including playwright <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>. The park service argues that the 18 dune shacks do not have architectural significance and therefore should not be placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Three <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrats, Sens. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Studds </PERSON>, who represents the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION>, are joining state and local officials in a fight to save the primitive huts from destruction. `` These buildings represent a unique aspect of American history and culture that should be preserved for future generations,'' they wrote <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mott </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, last week. `` We believe the dune shacks are indeed historic structures.'' The shacks, nestled in a two-mile strip of dunes in <LOCATION> Truro </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Provincetown </LOCATION> at the far end of the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION>, were originally built by the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> as shelters from harsh coastal weather. They became part of the park service's domain in 1961 when President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> created the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seashore </LOCATION>. The shacks' preservation has become an emotional issue in recent years because the expiration of one-time leases signed when the national seashore was created, usually for the owner's lifetime or 25 years. Preservationists want the federal government to declare the shacks historic treasures and allow a private organization to mantain them for public use. A study commissioned by the park service concluded that the primitive structures do not qualify for National Register protection. But critics say the study focused on the buildings' lack of architectural importance and ignored their historical and cultural significance that some proponents compare to that of <LOCATION> Walden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pond </LOCATION>, home of <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Thoreau </PERSON> With local support growing in favor of preserving the shacks, the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is expected to vote Wednesday in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to urge federal officials to save the buildings. The park service said it will issue a statement at that meeting. `` I am hopeful that they will decide that in years to come, many more people will have the same oppportunity for inspiration that the dune shacks have offered <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mailer </PERSON> and many others,'' <PERSON> Studds </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Harvard Freshman Want More Study Time, Less Class Time</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN GALVIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The typical Harvard freshman spends nearly 41 hours a week in class or studying, does n't go to sleep until after 1 a.m., and sometimes loses effectiveness because of weariness, depression and stress, according to a recent study. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Light </PERSON>, a doctoral candidate in education at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, asked 63 first-year students to log their days 15 minutes at a time for one week in March and one week in April. `` We assume that because they're coming to <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> they have their acts together in every way,'' he said. `` I do n't think that's true, having been a proctor -LRB- adviser -RRB- living in a freshman dorm for three years. The study was intended to determine if a time-logging exercise might be useful to new students and their advisers in helping the students make better use of their time. `` I've always been interested in the freshman experience of getting used to college life,'' Light said. `` It seems to be that the actual use of time not only affects a first-year student academically but also their sense of fulfillment and enjoyment in the experience.'' Fifty-six percent of the students said on at least one day that they were too weary to be productive. Thirty-seven percent said depression, frustration or stress made them unproductive. In addition to logging each period's activities, students were asked to indicate which ones were most valuable and which were a waste of time. Television was listed as a common time-waster, but more students mentioned at least once that a class or a lab was a waste of time. Forty-four percent said they wasted time watching television on at least one day during the survey period, but 62 percent thought classes were a waste of time and 54 percent felt labs were little help. Just 6 percent reported that they wasted time on drinking or a hangover at least once during the survey period. The students said they devoted an average of 5.83 hours a day, or 40.8 hours a week, to academics, including class time, study time and lab time. Students generally spend about 15 hours a week in the classroom, Light said. Light said he did not seek a random sample for his survey, but he got a good cross-section of the freshman class by simply asking students in two sections of one dormitory to participate. He said the 63 respondents from the 1,600-member class was about twice the minimum sample group for a survey. `` It's a carefully done study, but it's modest,'' Light said. `` We're not trying to draw too many earth-shattering generalizations but get to something that will help them put their time togther.'' Seventy-three percent said in retrospect they would have changed the way they spent a day. `` While many students could tell you, ` Yes, I do procrastinate' and ` Yes, I do n't get enough sleep sometimes' and ` I know if I studied without heavy metal -LRB- rock music -RRB- in the background I might be able to concentrate,' the exercise seems to be able to give students a more realistic views of how they spend their time,'' Light said During school nights, the students got an average of 7.5 hours of sleep on a school night, but not by going to bed early. Seventy-five percent of the students said they did n't get to bed until after midnight and 61 percent said they were usually up past 1 a.m. Even at 3 a.m., some 12 percent were awake. Light conducted follow-up interviews with 24 students and said most of them found the exercise useful in evaluating the way they spend their time. This fall, officials asked Light to make the exercise available to all freshmen who might find it helpful.

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has suggested to Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> that he become governor of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> in time to hand the British colony over to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1997, a newspaper reported Sunday. The Sunday Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> quoted from a new biography of the heir to the British throne, `` <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>,'' by journalist <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON>. The paper owns the newspaper rights to the book. <PERSON> Holden </PERSON>'s book says the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> suggestion was made during a March 25 meeting between <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> at the prince's <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> residence, <LOCATION> Kensington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION> It followed `` a discussion of the prince's wish that he might in the longer term be accorded some sort of title to reflect his increased status in national affairs,'' <PERSON> Holden </PERSON> says in his book. However, the appointment of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s governor to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, one of the most sensitive posts in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s diplomatic service, is made by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>' mother, <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, not the prime minister. Buckingham Palace had no comment on the report, and a spokesman for Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s 10 Downing St. office said Sunday, `` We never comment on any contacts between the prime minister and members of the royal family.'' <PERSON> Holden </PERSON> attributes his information to two separate sources he says are confidants of the prince's, the newspaper said. The author said in a television interview Sunday that <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, who celebrates his 40th birthday in November, `` still feels despite everything that people think he has n't got a proper job.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> has been training all his life to succeed his mother, who is 62 years old and in good health. <PERSON> Holden </PERSON> said he thinks the prince would welcome the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> job `` because it would be seen to give him a higher profile in national life ... he would be seen to be doing something on the forefront of the international stage.''

Authorities said a 12-year-old boy drowned. As the moon partially passed between the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and sun, worshipers chanted hymns and blew conch shells. About 3,000 naked holy men waded into the giant sacred pools of <LOCATION> Sannihit </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Brahmsarovar </PERSON>, followed in turns by an estimated 500,000 men and women, some clothed, others naked. Many carried coconuts, auspicious symbols for Hindus, and set them in the water. Others gave alms to beggars or Hindu priests, who offered prayers to the sun. There is an ancient belief that the sun is in pain during an eclipse and prayers must be offered for its relief. The scene was repeated, in smaller numbers, at rivers and pools across <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. An epic Hindu poem, the `` Mahabharata,'' promises salvation to those who bathe or give alms at <LOCATION> Kurukshetra </LOCATION> during a solar eclipse. <LOCATION> Kurukshetra </LOCATION>'s larger pool, <PERSON> Brahmasarovar </PERSON>, has a two-mile perimeter. <PERSON> Sannihit </PERSON>'s perimeter is about half that size. The pools can accomodate 125,000 people. Thousands of police stood guard and directed traffic in the town of 25,000 people about 90 miles north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. Divers and lifeguards kept watch over the bathers but could not save the 12-year-old boy from drowning, authorities said. The eclipse, which lasted about 90 minutes, was the third in the past year. The others occurred on March 18 and Sept. 13, 1987. According to Hindu legend, <LOCATION> Kurukshetra </LOCATION> was created by the Hindu god Lord <PERSON> Brahma </PERSON> and was the scene of an ancient battle in which Lord Vishnu, the protector of the Hindu diety, pleaded for righteousness.

 An 88-year-old woman trying to do her part to clean up litter was shocked when the discarded grocery bag she was picking up began moving. Inside was a newborn girl. `` I thought, ` Well, I'd better pick that garbage up,''' <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Sword </PERSON> said after the child was found Saturday. `` Then something moved,'' she said. `` I thought it was a snake at first, but then I saw the little fingers coming up. I said, ` Oh my Lord, it's a baby, a baby.' `` I was awfully shocked to find out it was a baby,'' Ms. Sword said. `` She did n't cry a bit. Usually, a newborn baby hollers like the dickens.'' The 6-pound, 2-ounce infant girl was listed in stable condition Sunday at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. Police believe she was born about 30 minutes before Ms. Sword found her. They were attempting to identify the child's mother, who could face child abuse charges. Hospital spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> said the infant, named only `` Girl Doe'' for the time being, `` appears to be a healthy baby. When a baby is born outside a hospital, and you do n't know the history ... you always take a wait-and-see attitude.'' Ms. Sword was returning from the library about 1 p.m. Saturday when she found the baby. Without touching the infant, she ran to her apartment and called police. `` I was a little worried because it did n't move, but then it cried,'' said paramedic <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cam </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedlund </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the state health department, said the child probably would be placed in a foster home, unless social workers find that the parents or grandparents are capable of caring for a newborn. `` If I was n't such a stickler for picking garbage from the sidewalk, it might not have been found,'' Ms. Sword said. `` That was a rough way to leave a child like that,'' she said.

 A man whose wedding was canceled after he kidnapped a woman to help finance the ceremony set off dynamite in a movie theater and killed himself, his girlfriend and eight other people, a newspaper said Sunday. <PERSON> Lan </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhihua </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Baoshan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, borrowed several thousand dollars to pay for his wedding, the Peasant's Daily said Unable to repay the debt, he raised the money by abducting a local woman and selling her to a man from out of town, the paper said.

When <PERSON> Lan </PERSON>'s fiancee found out about the abduction, she called the wedding off, the report said Lan, `` at the end of his tether,'' bought dynamite, invited his former fiancee to see a movie Aug. 14 and set off the blast just before the end, the paper said. The couple and eight other people were killed, and 27 people were injured. More than 1,000 people were in the theater, it said.

 Tamil extremists hacked to death 12 people, including five children, and the government implemented a plan to try to end ethnic violence in two provinces, officials said Sunday. Five others were seriously injured in the attack Saturday in the eastern village of <LOCATION> Suhadagama </LOCATION>, said a military spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Suhadagama </PERSON> is about 150 miles south of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, the capital. The spokesman quoted witnesses as saying about 20 Tamil militants stabbed the victims with pickaxes, swords and daggers. The dead included four Tamils who were married to Sinhalese women, the spokesman said. Their wives were not hurt, he said. The insurgents were blamed for a similar attack two weeks ago in which 11 Sinhalese farmers were butchered in neighboring <LOCATION> Polonnaruwaq </LOCATION> district. Tamil rebels want to set up a separate nation in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s north and east provinces The insurgents claim both provinces as their traditional homeland and have been attacking villages to try to chase away Sinhalese and Moslem settlers. Tamils are mostly Hindu and make up 18 percent of the island's 16 million people They claim they are discriminated against by the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION>, who comprise about 75 percent of the country's population. In July 1987, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> signed a peace accord aimed at ending five years of bloodshed. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> sent an estimated 50,000 troops to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to try to enforce the agreement. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> became involved in the conflict because it is the regional power and because more than 60 million Tamils living in southern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> are sympathetic to the rebels' cause. A key provision of the agreement calls for the merger of the north and east provinces. The union then will be governed by an elected provincial council that would take over most administrative and political duties now handled by the federal government. The government of President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> announced the merger on Saturday and said it believes a provincial council will be chosen by January. The rebels have had no response. The Tamil separatist campaign, launched in 1983, has claimed at least 8,500 lives, including more than 550 Indian soldiers. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> says its troops have killed at least 1,000 Tamil insurgents.

 The toll from the crash of a Soviet-made Air Vietnam airplane rose to 76 when a stewardess died, officials said Sunday. The stewardess, <PERSON> Ha </PERSON> <PERSON> Mina </PERSON> <PERSON> Hang </PERSON>, died of internal bleeding on Saturday, hospital officials said. She was among six people rescued Friday from the wreckage of the Tu-134 aircraft that crashed four miles before it was to land at <LOCATION> Don </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Muango </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> during a flight from <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>. Among those killed in the crash was <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s health minister, <PERSON> Dang </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoi </PERSON> <PERSON> Huan </PERSON>, and several diplomats. Thai and Vietnamese investigators said Sunday they still do n't know what caused the second worst air disaster in <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> history On Aug. 31, 1987, a <ORGANIZATION> Thai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jetliner crashed into the sea off the southern resort island of <LOCATION> Phuket </LOCATION>, killing all 83 people aboard. Authorities said the five survivors, including the captain, navigator, and mechanic of the plane, remained in intensive care Sunday in local hospitals. The head of the Thai investigating team, <PERSON> Srisook </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandrangsu </PERSON>, confirmed <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> news reports that the captain, <PERSON> Khong </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinh </PERSON> <PERSON> Phuong </PERSON>, stumbled out of the cockpit after the crash and asked a villager for a clean shirt and to use the telephone. He was the only survivor who was rescued conscious. <PERSON> Phuong </PERSON> earlier was quoted as saying the plane was struck by lightning. The two inflight recorders containing flight data and the final conversations between the crew and control tower have been recovered. The plane last made radio contact with the control tower one minute before it crashed, the general manager of the international airport said Sunday. Weather officials at the airport said skies there were clear at the time but that strong winds and heavy rains buffeted nearby areas. During its final radio contact, the plane was flying at about 1,600 feet and was believed to have lowered its landing gear and wing flaps for an emergency landing, said the airport manager, <PERSON> Charoon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peetong </PERSON>. Vietnamese Prime Minister Do Muoi sent a team of investigators to the site to work with Thai authorities in determining cause of the accident `` and to resolve all consequences arising therefrom,'' state-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanoi </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Nihon </ORGANIZATION> television network Saturday quoted Vietnamese officials as saying <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s 16-member Olympic team canceled their seats on the flight only two days earlier. The Vietnamese Embassy in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> said the victims also included <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s ambassador-designate to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhuong </PERSON> <PERSON> Vu </PERSON>, and several lower-ranking government officials. Diplomats said the dead included <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arun </PERSON> <PERSON> Patwardhan </PERSON>, and seven officials of his embassy; the second secretary of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s embassy in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>; and the second secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Australian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>. Many of the bodies were burned beyond recognition. The Tu-134, the Vietnamese flag carrier's main aircraft, is used by the Soviet airline <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION>, although several have crashed in recent years. One Tu-134 crashed in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> last February; another crashed in October 1986, killing <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Samora </PERSON> <PERSON> Machel </PERSON>. The Japanese aviation magazine <PERSON> Kokujoho </PERSON> says the Tu-134, which first flew in 1963, is no longer produced. Air <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> officials say they would like to switch to newer, Western-made planes but do not have enough money.

 Radical students burned an effigy of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo on Sunday and accused the government of staging the Olympics to strengthen military rule. The demonstrations at <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> were peaceful and there were no reports of arrests or injuries, in contrast to the violent clashes with police on Friday and Saturday. `` Oppose the half Olympics!'' shouted about 350 students, referring to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s boycott of the Sept. 17-Oct. 2 Games in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> after its demand to be a co-host for the Games was denied The protesters chanted `` Yankee go home!'' as they marched to the front gate of the university in eastern <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. The students charge that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is helping the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government to use the Olympics to strengthen what they say is a dictatorial rule. `` We do not oppose the Olympics itself,'' said a student, who requested anonymity. `` But Olympics is staged by a military government for propaganda purposes. The military government led by <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> oppresses the masses.'' Leaflets distributed by students at a rally before the effigy burning included a picture of the interlocking Olympic rings made of barbed wire superimposed on a photograph of Olympic Park. Several thousand police armed with tear gas and other riot-control weapons watched the demonstrations from across the busy street in front of the university. The government has ordered police to avoid using tear gas during the Olympics. Radical students, who have called for anti-Olympic protests, have so far demonstrated on a few campuses in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and other cities. They have not protested near the Olympic sites. The radicals, a small but vocal minority on campuses, have virtually no public support among most South Koreans. Many government officials say they believe radicals are controlled by communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Radical students claim that <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> is a front for continued military rule and say they are determined to topple the government. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, a former general who won the presidential elections in December, has introduced broad democratic reforms and dismantled authoritarian controls. His popularity among the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> people has risen steadily since he took office in February. Students marching to <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION>'s main gate on Sunday carried a 6-foot-high pole wrapped in gasoline-soaked rags, with a frowning paper face representing <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> tied to it. The effigy was torched while students sang protest songs and marched with flags and banners. After the demonstration, the students dispersed voluntarily. Protests at <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> erupted into violence Friday and Saturday when students, some armed with wood and iron clubs, threw firebombs and rocks at police.

<HEAD>Flight 655 Compensation Unlikely Until After Reagan Leaves Office</HEAD>

 Families of the 290 people killed in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> downing of <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Flight 655 are unlikely to receive compensation during the remaining months of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, officials say. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> pledged to offer compensation soon after the U.S.S. <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> shot down the plane over the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, but the plan still faces two steep hurdles _ the bureaucratic and legal obstacles caused by a lack of communications between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and its continued unpopularity on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. `` I think we're a long way from payments actually being made, if they ever actually are,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` It's a hard sell up here on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. There's not a lot of support up here for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` And in addition, you have a lot of questions _ who do you actually pay, how do you get them the money, how do you make sure it goes to the families and not to the government of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>?'' The case involves the destruction of <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Flight 655, shot down July 3 by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> cruiser <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> in the Strait of Hormuz shortly after taking off from <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>. All 290 persons aboard were killed when the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> fired two missiles in the mistaken belief that the unidentified plane was an Iranian military F-14. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials expressed regret and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> decided July 11 to offer compensation to families of the victims, but the plan quickly ran into opposition in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Legislators were reflecting a decade of public unhappiness with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and its leader, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, dating back to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s taking of American hostages. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigation, headed by Rear Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogarty </PERSON>, found last month the shoot-down was due to a series of stress-caused human mistakes made by a crew in combat for the first time. But the Fogarty report also laid some blame on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, criticizing that country for permitting a commercial airliner to fly over a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warship that had been engaged in a firefight with Iranian gunboats. While the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> was investigating, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> began trying to answer the myriad of questions raised by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s announcement For example, the questions of who gets the money is unanswered. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> have no diplomatic relations and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has not yet even furnished a manifest with the names of the passengers. Another question is how much to pay. One congressional official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the amounts range from $ 50,000 to $ 250,000 per victim. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will carefully scrutinize any plan the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> develops. Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, said, `` I'm willing to consider compensation, but I do n't want one penny to go to the government of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, D-Neb., said the <ORGANIZATION> Fogarty </ORGANIZATION> report underscores the need for compensation, `` but we have to be careful that none of the money goes to the government. While the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is offering compensation, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials point out that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has refused to pay anything for two incidents in which the Soviets shot down Korean Airline planes. In one incident, in 1978, two passengers were killed, and in the other, in 1983, 269 people were killed, including 60 Americans.

 The scrawled note by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> about a controversial prison project turned out to be prophetic: `` This spells mucho trouble. Let's discuss. MSD.'' Later, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor penned another message to his legal counsel on a plan to build a prison in the tiny central town of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Braintree </LOCATION>: `` No further action until we discuss.

That has been the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> management style through recent, largely crisis-free years, as governor. The style, born of a first-term disaster, has been an easy one to adopt in a state with a boom economy and little opposition from Republicans. But on the campaign trail, as the presidential race tightens and he comes under relentless criticism by Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has given indications that he wants to turn more aggressive. That was much in evidence when he re-hired <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>, the campaign chief who was ousted after releasing the tape that led to <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>'s withdrawal from the presidential race. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> took some heat for the decision. But he got his way, and fallout was minimized by his timing: he made the announcement at the start of the long Labor Day weekend. `` I do n't think he sees himself as a great risk-taker. He does n't place a high value on that,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Linsky </PERSON>, a lecturer at the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> who was a Republican colleague in the state Legislature. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' cautious approach to the <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> affair reflected lessons he learned in 1975, when, trying to keep a strong campaign promise of `` no new taxes,'' he held out until forced to impose tax increases and spending cuts that angered both the right and left. `` Going down the street with him, the verbal abuse he would take from people was quite unbelievable,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, son of the former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' lieutenant governor in 1975. `` I really think he had such confidence in his ability to handle the -LRB- deficit -RRB- problem that that would have an overriding effect on the public relations end of the problem.'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Grandmaison </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, managed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' 1974 campaign for governor and recalls a politician much more willing to make snap decisions then than he is now. `` Back in the early'70s he was far more likely to look at a situation and come to an immediate conclusion about what was the best way to proceed,'' he said. The lesson was clear, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrity </PERSON>, the former judge who pushed the administration into the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> cleanup project: `` Once burned, twice shy.'' After he won back the governorship in 1982, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> kept a tight rein on news emanating from the governor's office and from the many state agencies. No press release bearing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' name went out without being personally checked by the governor. Press aides kept lists of `` good'' and `` bad'' reporters, broken down by those whose coverage favored or hurt the administration. `` He's taken more seriously the communications aspect of government,'' <PERSON> Linsky </PERSON> said. The much-heralded transformation of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> from his early years in office to his two recent terms was not entirely complete, <PERSON> Linsky </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> once again this year finds himself wrestling with a state budget shortfall. Although the crisis is n't as serious as in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' first term, he has had to sign a cigarette tax into law to help raise tax revenues. `` One of the ways to think about the pattern of not dealing with revenue problems until fairly late in the game is that if he does n't want it to be a problem, he does n't see it as a problem,'' <PERSON> Linsky </PERSON> said. In 1986, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> used the hunker-down approach to distance himself from disclosures that state officials had approved a $ 10,000 payment to silence a student who charged a state college president with sexual assault. The governor recalled first hearing about the alleged assault and the payoff in January 1986. He said he told a top state education official to `` get on it'' and `` take care of it.'' But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did nothing further to investigate until the story intensified six months later. For more than a year <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> let two top administration officials handle questions on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Braintree </LOCATION> prison issue even amid charges _ later refuted _ that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had granted a personal favor to friends who owned the prison site. He also kept a back seat when a prison furlough program that he deeply believed in came under fire when a convicted murderer on furlough terrorized a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> couple. He reversed the furlough policy as public opinion was reaching a crescendo. But a cautious approach to governing that kept <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> out of trouble in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> has n't translated into safety on the campaign trail. Early this month <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> scored political points by coming to polluted <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> to highlight an example of what he called the consequences of excessive delay. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was forced to defend himself by saying that after a decade as governor, something was finally being done to clean the harbor.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s use of poison gas against its Kurdish minority is prompting concern that other nations bogged down in armed conflict might resort to the `` silent killer'' in violation of a universally accepted ban on use of chemical weapons. According to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, there is little question that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s use of mustard gas against Iranian forces influenced <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s decision to end their eight-year old <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war last month Almost immediately after the cease-fire took effect, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> launched an offensive against its Kurdish minority as suspected collaborators with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Tens of thousands of Kurds were forced to flee into southern <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. Last week, about nine days after the first reports of Iraqi chemical warfare began to circulate, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he was convinced the allegations were true. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> accused the Iraqis of `` unjustifiable and abhorrent'' behavior. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> then unanimously approved stringent economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s minister of state for foreign affairs, <PERSON> Saddoun </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammadi </PERSON>, met with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> on Thursday and called the charges `` absolutely baseless.'' But well before the latest Iraqi assault on the Kurds, a number of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> investigations concluded that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> _ and to a lesser extent, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> _ had engaged in chemical warfare since 1984. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has sharply criticized <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> from time to time and unanimous <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolutions have done the same. But the international reaction generally has been muted and unsustained, possibly reflecting the lack of global sympathy for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s fundamentalist Islamic regime. Last May, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> complained that the absence of punitive measures against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was having a `` disastrous'' effect. Indeed, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> report issued two months later said that use of chemical weapons against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was `` intensifying and has become more frequent.'' The 1925 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> convention banning use of chemical weapons, which was signed by 105 nations, was seen as a major step toward humanizing armed conflict and assuring that the horrors of poison and nerve gas attacks in World War I would never be repeated. That optimistic view has been changed by the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war and its ghastly aftermath, foreign affairs analysts say. They are now concernd that other war-weary nations may conclude that the benefits of using chemical weapons may outweigh the costs. Some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials privately share the conclusion of <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, a neurobiologist at <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Open </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, who was quoted in <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> as saying that despite a `` major act of genocide, the fact is, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has got away with it.'' <PERSON> Elisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, agrees with that assessment, according to Time. She said other Third World countries might follow <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s example believe that they `` might not have to pay a high political price.'' The <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> convention outlaws use of `` asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases and of bacteriological methods of warfare'' that can cause vomiting, choking and skin irritation or worst, a speedy death. In 1915, when exposed to German-deployed lethal chlorine near the Belgian town of <LOCATION> Ypres </LOCATION>, 5,000 French troops were killed and 10,000 others injured in a single afternoon. World War I claimed an estimated 91,000 soldiers dead and 1.2 million wounded of gas attacks by both sides. Although 60 million are said to have died during World War II, chemical weapons were not used, possibly because of the deterrent effect of knowing that all sides had extensive chemical arsenals. President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> banned manufacture of chemical weapons in 1969 but President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ordered its resumption last December in the belief that a new deterrent was needed. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have discussed ways to limit chemical weapons, and the issue is being debated by a 40-nation Conference on Disarmament. But progress toward agreement has been slow, and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is worried there may be a trend toward greater proliferation of chemical weaponry.

 Top government officials touring Yellowstone National Park expressed shock at the extent of forest fire damage and promised changes in firefighting policies and more soldiers to battle the flames. `` There's no way you can capture the thing like being here,'' Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said. `` Just look at it _ devastating. ... Look at the natural beauty that's been interfered with.'' `` I think it's devastating. We've said before, it's a disaster,'' <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> replied when asked his impressions during the stopover Saturday at <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>. `` The extent of the burned area we've just driven through is more than you can imagine,'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> added. Officials who briefed them were not optimistic about getting the situation in hand anytime soon. `` The potential for controlling these fires is not very great,'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said. `` This is a terribly difficult situation.'' <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwinden </PERSON>, who along with <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> joined the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> officials on the visit, was somber after hearing a briefing on the fire situation. <PERSON> Schwinden </PERSON> said the officials were told: `` ` There are three breaks you can get as firefighters. One is a break in the weather, a break in the topography, and a break in fuels.' `` I asked, if there's no break in the weather, are there breaks in fuels or topography? And they have n't worked to this point. So unless we see some major precipitation, I think we'll see a substantial spread'' of the fires. Unless there is generous snow this winter, the area could actually continue to have fire problems next summer, a veteran forest ranger said. `` We periodically have fires that will hold over through the winter and start up again in the spring,'' <PERSON> Skip </PERSON> <PERSON> Starkey </PERSON>, a fire management specialist and 11-year veteran of the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters during Saturday's official tour. While the weather may not cooperate, additional human resources will be sent into action, officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> had earlier supplied about 2,300 Army soldiers from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>. Deputy Defense Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> IV announced at Old Faithful that they would be joined by two <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> battalions _ 1,200 men _ from <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pendleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and two additional Army battalions `` So by the end of next week, we will see a doubled representation by the military in this effort,'' <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> said. `` We have a fair amount of air equipment here, and helicopters,'' <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> added. `` We'll be bringing in more of that, too.'' Canadian firefighters also will be pressed into service, thanks to congressional approval last week of enabling legislation, <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> noted. <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> promised at a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> news conference that the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would make changes in its fire suppression policies to avoid a similar situation in the future. That brought applause from an audience of townspeople who have been highly critical of the way the summer's fires have been handled. <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> and others, however, reiterated their assertion that nature, not mismanagement, was to blame. `` You know, it's OK for people if they want to blame somebody for what has been a dreadful natural experience,'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said. `` But I've been involved all summer with this drought, and I can tell you that, wherever you go in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> continent, you see the effects of the worst drought that we've ever had. And this fire is one of them.'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> added: `` This year, if they'd been able to foresee the kind of conditions we've got, they would have been fighting every fire from the beginning. `` In fact, all the destruction we've driven through was a fire that they fought from the beginning and could n't control it,'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said, referring to the North Fork fire which destroyed buildings at Old Faithful geyser and threatened <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> and park headquarters at <LOCATION> Mammoth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>. `` I think the key is to get these fires out, and then review what's going on,'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said.

 Life at the fire camp for the Clover-Mist forest fire might not be quite as comfortable as home, but now the firefighters can at least see what's going on in the rest of the world. The camp sits on a sagebrush-covered plateau near the Crandall Ranger Station along the western border of the <ORGANIZATION> Shoshone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. Until Saturday, firefighters with time off from the fire lines on the 322,000-acre fire relied on a videotape collection of movies to while away the hours. Now they've got a television satellite dish and can tap into just about anything being broadcast, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, who works for <ORGANIZATION> Rezek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, company that provides fire camp services and which helped arrange for the dish. `` This is just so the guys will have something to watch,'' said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, who work for Aqua-One, another <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> company that normally provides shower and water purification equipment to fire camps and decided to throw in the satellite dish. While it's not unusual for fire camps to have televisions and videocassette recorders for entertainment, <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said he has n't heard of any other camps getting their own satellite dish `` This is kind of an experimental thing,'' agreed <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>. The signal from the dish runs to a 40-inch television set in the `` Grand,'' a large canvas tent equipped with 17 log benches and a wood-burning stove for the cold <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> nights. Live television is n't the only benefit enjoyed by the Clover-Mist firefighters. There's a truck-based laundry service that processes two tons of clothes each day; hot and cold showers; a small library; and a tent phone booth with two direct-dial phones.

 The foreign ministers of the 101-nation non-aligned movement Sunday criticized the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and expressed support for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. In a statement at the end of their four-day annual conference, the ministers charged that the situation in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has `` worsened considerably'' and reiterated a call for sanctions against both. The conference, which was attended by 95 of the 101 members, condemned <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for `` acts of genocide'' against its black population and a `` policy of state terrorism.'' The ministers `` expressed their indignation and dismay that certain Western nations ... continued to aid and abet apartheid economically, financially, politically and diplomatically.'' They said they regret that efforts by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to impose sanctions on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> were blocked by American and British vetoes. The ministers called on the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to take over `` temporary supervision'' of the Israeli-occupied territories to protect Palestinians from the `` acts of terrorism and atrocities'' by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. More than 260 Palestinians have been killed in the 10-month-old uprising, and thousands have been detained. Five Israelis also have died. The non-aligned movement Friday drafted a resolution supporting the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizaion </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to declare an independent Palestinian state in the occupied territories. The ministers called for the non-aligned movement to financially aid the Palestinians. The resolution emerged from a session by the conference's nine-member <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> committee, which includes the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> On another subject in the final statement, the ministers expressed support for the leftist Sandinista government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, a member of the non-aligned movement, and demanded an end to the financing of the U.S.-backed Contra rebels. In a separate document, the ministers said prospects for the world economy were `` gloomy'' and that the `` prolonged crisis in the international economic situation'' was widening the gap between the developed and the non-aligned and other developing countries. The report called for the lowering of interest rates, the reversal of the flow of resources from developing to developed countries and an increased access to the markets of the developed countries. The conference also adopted a special `` <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> Declaration,'' which mandates a special committee appointed by the conference to take steps to streamline the organization of the movement. Many of the delegates to the conference criticized the non-aligned movement for becoming stagnated and losing its credibility. The conference ended with the choice by consensus of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> _ one of the founding members of the movement in l961 _ as the host of next year's summit conference of non-aligned states. This automatically gives it the chairmanship of the movement for the next three years. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> emerged as a compromise when two other declared candidates, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, failed to win a consensus.

 Unless nature is generous with moisture in the coming months, fires in <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> could continue to burn until next summer, a veteran forest ranger says. `` We periodically have fires that will hold over through the winter and start up again in the spring,'' says <PERSON> Skip </PERSON> <PERSON> Starkey </PERSON>, a fire management specialist and 11-year veteran of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` Certainly there is a possibility for that to happen,'' he says. `` It would depend on what kind of snow we get this winter, what kind of rain we get this fall and next spring.'' <PERSON> Starkey </PERSON>, based at the <PERSON> Bozeman </PERSON> headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Gallatin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, escorted a group of reporters and photographers Saturday during a visit to the park by <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>, Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> and Assistant Defense Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> IV. Although there have been technical advances in fighting forest fires, including infrared aerial photography, computer modeling and sophisticated weather analysis, <PERSON> Starkey </PERSON> said: `` Firefighting ... is not an exact science by any stretch of the imagination. There's still a lot of art to it.'' He pointed out various fire patterns in the lodgepole pine stands along the 30-mile stretch of road between <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> and Old Faithful. In some areas flames skipped randomly, blackening some trees and sparing others. The fire `` crowned'' other sections of forest by jumping from treetop to treetop. And in other areas less-intense flames crept along the ground, leaving an ashen forest floor but trees that were still green and healthy. `` You do n't get a continuous, complete burn all over'' in a forest fire, he explained. `` It's like a mosaic.'' <PERSON> Starkey </PERSON> said many of the dead trees on the forest floor were killed not by flames but by lodgepole pine beetles. And with its shallow root system, the lodgepole pine can easily be blown over in a stiff wind. This provides a major source of fuel for advancing fires, but the lodgepole pine actually depends on fires to release its seeds from their cones, <PERSON> Starkey </PERSON> explained. During the drive between Old Faithful and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, rain began to fall. `` This sprinkle is n't going to help, except it raises the humidity,'' <PERSON> Starkey </PERSON> said. `` Spots do n't ignite as easily. ... There's less of a chance it will result in a fire. `` This is the biggest benefit from a day like this. You can get in there and work close to the fire. ... The fire is less able to generate explosive behavior.'' But the rain continued and grew from a mere sprinkle to a respectable drizzle. `` That's the kind of weather I like,'' <PERSON> Starkey </PERSON> said. `` I'd like to see about two weeks of this.''

<HEAD>NASA Official Says Shuttle Launch May Take More Than One Try</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The head of the nation's space flight program cautioned Sunday that <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> might not be able to launch space shuttle Discovery on the first attempt late this month. `` I think that when we get do get to a launch date on the latter part of this month, it would n't surprise me at all if it took us two or three times to get airborne,'' said Rear Adm. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Truly </PERSON>, the head of the shuttle program. Truly, who is <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> associate administrator for space flight, said that if two recent successful simulations of crew and launch systems had been the real thing, a launch would not have taken place because of weather and winds. `` We're going to wait until we have it right, and then we're going to do it,'' said Truly, a two-time shuttle astronaut `` I think the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people expect that of us and that's what we're going to do. Appearing on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>,'' Truly shied away from revealing a date for the launch of the first shuttle since the Challenger exploded on liftoff in January 1986, except to say it probably will be late in September. `` It will be the last week in September unless there is a hiccup,'' he said. Truly said the date will be announced after a two-day flight readiness review at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> on Wednesday. He said there has been no administration pressure to have the shuttle program restart before the election for whatever political advantage that might give to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I've felt a lot of stresses in the last 2 1 @ 2 years,'' said Truly, `` but, thank God, that's not one of them.'' Asked what he would say if such a call came from a high official, Truly replied: `` I'd say, not on my watch.''

 Bourgeois capitalists set up tents beside leftist guerrillas and <PERSON> Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> showed couture gowns at the annual celebration of French Communism. Hundreds of thousands of people attended the weekend `` Fete de l'Humanite'' in this working class suburb north of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. It opened with the fashion show Friday and closed Sunday with a speech by party boss <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchais </PERSON>. L'Humanite is the French Communist newspaper. A similar fair for the Italian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> L'Unita </ORGANIZATION> took place in <LOCATION> Campi </LOCATION> di Bisenzio outside <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>. The French festival was reminiscent of huge country fair complete with carnival rides, Kewpie dolls and acres of food. But ideology was everywhere. Bumper cars faced stands emblazoned with a huge hammers-and-sickles. `` Glasnost'' T-shirts, referring to the Soviet campaign for greater openness, were a hot item. Game prizes included a free trip for two to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Stands offering Russian caviar and tea served from samovars competed with hundreds of others serving Brittany crepes, Alsatian choucroute and every sort of French regional dish. An African National Congress booth sold buttons of the South African guerrilla group's jailed leader, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. Nearby were stands where representatives from the Dutch electronics firm <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> and the German high-tech corporation Telefunken pitched their newest products. `` The customers are not our usual ones, but there are so many people here we ca n't really afford to miss this,'' said an encyclopedia salesman, who had a volume opened to an entry on <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> and a sign saying he accepted credit cards. The variety of booths this year is greater than ever and may reflect an effort by the party to modernize its stodgy, doctrinaire image to conform with changes in French society. Since Socialist President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> reinvigorated his party after his election in 1981, French Communism has been in steep decline. Once capable of winning a quarter of the popular vote, the party's official candidate, <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Lejoinie </PERSON>, garnered only 6.8 percent of the vote in presidential balloting last spring, the lowest score since the party was founded in 1920. Analysts blame the fall on several factors, including the inability of the party to adapt to modern society where the number of blue collar workers has significantly diminished, reducing the ranks of traditional Communist faithful. Voters now tend to be better educated, more sophisticated and less doctrinaire. `` Like everywhere in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the agent of modernization for decades, is now obsolete,'' said the French newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION> in an article Sunday under a headline `` The Identity Crisis of the Communist Worker.'' But one Communist worker, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gauter </PERSON>, disagrees. A bus driver from the southwestern town of <LOCATION> Angouleme </LOCATION> and secretary of the local party, <PERSON> Gauter </PERSON> is hopeful that the upcoming district elections will show an increase in Communist strength. At his fair booth Saturday night, <PERSON> Gauter </PERSON> served two girls a plate of steaming snails and talked to them about the elections. `` One of those girls was unemployed and does n't vote,'' <PERSON> Gauter </PERSON>, 35, said afterward. `` She said she would vote with us at the end of this month and I think she will. `` Anyway,'' he said, `` she likes our party.''

 Parliament on Sunday yielded to weeks of massive nationwide protests and approved holding the first multiparty elections since 1960. The legislature appointed a group of elders to supervise the polling and set a target date for about three months from Saturday, when President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> announced the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would relinquish its 26-year monopoly on power. Despite government concessions, opposition leaders continued to press for an interim government to cope with <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s growing chaos, and demonstrations continued in the capital. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> issued a stern warning to demonstrators, who have taken to the streets by the millions since spring in their fight for democracy. `` People are now fed up with this lawlessness and are expecting the government to take effective action,'' <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> said. `` I therefore warn those responsible for the lawlessness to cease such activities.'' In some areas of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, he said, students and <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks were setting up rival local governments, creating `` a grave and dangerous situation for those responsible.'' `` It is essential to remove them immediately,'' he said. He called on demonstrators to get back to work and on civil servants to reactivate the stalled machinery of government. In addition, he attacked the recent formation of a rival government by former Prime Minister U Nu. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> called Sunday's decision `` a milestone in Burmese history.'' `` It will be evident in 20 years' time whether the decision was correct or not,'' he told the 489-member <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. While authorizing elections in about three months, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> also held out the possibility that they could be postponed or held as early as November. Parliament empowered the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, the highest government organ, to change the Constitution to permit a multiparty system, enlarge the elections commission if necessary and formulate election rules. Named to the <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> were three retired civil servants, a retired army brigadier general and a former member of Parliament. The men, all over 70 years of age, are generally regarded as neutral, although not especially prominent. At least four are not members of the ruling party. The Parliament session was held under tight security, and delegates slept in the building Saturday night. The area was cordoned off with barbed-wire fences and road blocks manned by troops. The multiparty elections would be the first in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> since Feb. 6, 1960, when <ORGANIZATION> U </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nu </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Facist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> won a massive victory over an army-backed party. U Nu was overthrown by the military on March 2, 1962. The coup, led by Gen. <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>, ushered in rigid one-party rule. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s 22 million voters to `` use their potent weapon _ the vote _ to choose the right representatives.'' `` Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely,'' <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> told the party congress Saturday, quoting the 19th century British historian <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Acton </PERSON>. `` When one has power, one wallows in its luxury, and when one has no power one thirsts for it.'' The Western-trained lawyer and author, the country's first civilian leader in 26 years, said he would not run in the elections and the powerful military `` will not lobby for any party in the general elections.'' A Western diplomat in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> said the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> people were highly skeptical of the recent government moves. `` They do n't trust the government to keep this promise'' of elections, said the diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` They perceive it as another trick.'' Meanwhile, 218 dependents of diplomats and non-essential staffers, including 59 Americans, left <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> Sunday on a special <ORGANIZATION> Thai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> flight to <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yuji </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurokawa </PERSON>, counselor at the Japanese Embassy, said there were 102 Japanese aboard, including eight officials; three Burmese married to Japanese; 32 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> officials and their families; and some West Germans and Britons. He said the Americans included embassy dependents and aid officials. More than 230 people flew out Friday as a precautionary move. `` All the people who wanted to come out have come out'' and there will be no more evacuations for now, <PERSON> Kurokawa </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. In recent weeks, the government has made one concession after another. Ne Win resigned as head of the ruling party in July, citing widespread street protests in March and June as a factor in his decision. When <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, a hard-liner widely hated for his brutal suppression of dissidents, was chosen to succeed him, riots erupted. Troops killed 112 protesters, the government said, but Western diplomats said the number was much higher. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> resigned Aug. 12 after 17 days in power, and <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> was named to replace him. Martial law was lifted and activities that before would have drawn prison terms or worse were allowed.

 A car bomb exploded on a busy street near the Pakistani Embassy in the Afghan capital <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on Sunday, killing 10 people and injuring about 40 others, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The official Soviet news agency blamed Afghan rebels. `` The crime prepared and committed by Afghan extremists claimed the lives of some 10 people, including women and children,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` According to preliminary information, another 40 <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> residents were injured.'' A building near the Pakistani Embassy was seriously damaged, as were 40 stores and 10 cars, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. It provided no other details. In <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, near the Afghan border, six people were injured when a bomb went off in a crowded marketplace near a garment shop, said a police spokesman. No one claimed responsibility for the explosion, but <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> blames such terrorist activities on the Soviet-trained Afghan secret service <LOCATION> Khad </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION> in the headquarters of the anti-communist Afghan guerrilla movement. The U.S.-backed insurgents are fighting to overthrow the Soviet-backed government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. Rocket and other blasts have become almost daily in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the Afghan capital, since the Soviet troop withdrawal began on May 15. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> authorities have blamed all of them on the insurgents, but Western diplomats believe some bombings are part of long-standing factional infighting between communists loyal to President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and a rival faction that dominates the military. Under an agreement signed April 14, the Soviet government is withdrawing the estimated 115,000 soldiers it had stationed in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, leaving the fighting to Afghan government forces. The Soviet soldiers are to be entirely withdrawn by Feb. 15. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> have complained bitterly to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and to <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> authorities that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> continues to assist the guerrillas. The Soviets entered Afghaninstan in December 1979, replaced one Marxist regime with another and backed that regime against the guerrilla uprising.

 The federal and state prison population grew by 4 percent in the first six months of 1988 to a record 604,824 inmates, with female prisoners increasing at a far higher rate than males, the federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agency said the six-month increase of 23,240 prisoners would require adding 900 new prison beds every week. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenfeld </PERSON>, bureau director of correctional statistics, attributed the increase partly to stricter parole supervision, with a higher number of parole violators being returned to prison, and a wider use of mandatory minumum sentences for repeat drug offenses and other serious crimes. The gain in female prisoners reflects a trend toward more frequent drug convictions among women than men, <PERSON> Greenfeld </PERSON> said. He said the six-month increase in all federal and state prisoners fit the pattern of similar growth in the past two or three years, resulting from revised sentencing guidelines by the states. The largest percentage increases from Jan. 1 through June 30 occurred in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, which reported 17.9 percent more inmates; the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> had 13.6 percent more, and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>, 12.8 percent, the bureau said. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, which added 5,146 inmates for a 7.7 percent increase during that period, accounted for 22 percent of the nationwide growth in the prison population and housed nearly 12 percent of all federal and state prisoners, the report said. Another record reported by the bureau was the number of prisoners with sentences of more than one year _ 237 per 100,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> residents _ compared with 139 such prisoners at the end of 1980. The bureau said the number of female inmates grew 6.7 percent so far this year, compared with 3.9 percent for males. Since 1980, the number of female prisoners has increased 130 percent to a total of 30,834 last June 30. Male prisoners increased by 81 percent in the same period, to a total of 573,990, the bureau said. During the full year ended June 30, state prison populations grew by 6.2 percent, reaching 555,666 inmates, while the number of federal prison inmates increased by 3.2 percent to a total of 49,158.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> appealed Sunday for reconciliation, racial harmony and human rights in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, a region teeming with tribal, racial and political problems. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s first full day on his tour of the region was crammed with events, beginning with a meeting with the country's seven <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops and ending with a session with diplomats. In between, he celebrated a 2 -LCB- - hour Mass before more than 200,000 people, met with members of the laity and spoke to 30,000 youths at a jammed sports stadium His comments did not have the political edge that they did Saturday, when he arrived here for 10 days of travel through five black-ruled countries that are neighbors to white-led <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. On Saturday, the pope talked of powerful political, economic and ideological forces that endanger the stability of the region and who fomented ethnic and tribal conflicts. Though he did not identify any country, he clearly linked <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to his comments when he said they were `` true for the grave issue of apartheid,'' <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>'s system of racial segregation. In a symbolic gesture toward the South African <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> invited the former archbishop of <LOCATION> Capetown </LOCATION> to join his official party for the rest of his five-nation <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> tour. And in another development aimed at creating what the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> called `` an atmosphere of conciliation,'' a spokesman welcomed Monday's meeting between South African President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and his Mozambican counterpart, <PERSON> Joaquim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON>'s government alleges that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> supports an 11-year-old guerrilla insurgency in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> told reporters that <PERSON> Cardinal </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>, 71, archbishop emeritus of <LOCATION> Capetown </LOCATION>, would travel on to <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> on the pope's plane. <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>, who is white, is considered a moderate. Politics did not figure in <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s talks with diplomats. Instead, he urged the officials to use their influence to help <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> with its food problems, refugees and development. `` The countries of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> themselves must be in charge of their own development and historic destiny,'' he said. `` Outside aid is urgently needed, but it will only be helpful in the long term if the essential force of growth and development is truly <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' The pope celebrated Mass from a scaffold altar the size of a small house at <LOCATION> Barrowdale </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> race course. Tens of thousands of people _ many from the neighboring countries of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> _ sat on the ground in the infield. Thousands more crowded the VIP stands. Parish choirs sang traditional hymns to the accompaniment of animal skin drums and trumpets made from antelope horns. Before the Mass began, three women carrying on their heads clay pots filled with water climbed the steps of the towering altar and kneeled before the pope.

The most rousing welcome of the day for the pope came from the youths who greeted him with cheers and the din of hundreds of traditional rattles made from gourds with seeds inside. `` Remember, when God looks at you, he does not see a black face, or a white face, or a brown face = he sees the face of his son, <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> told the youths

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> faces renewed anti-drug amendment battles this week, including votes on proposals to fine drug users $ 10,000 and induce states to take away their right to drive. As lawmakers resume amending their all-inclusive drug fighting bill on Wednesday, they also must decide whether to retain a seven-day waiting period for handgun purchasers, along with an optional police background check. Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., will try to eliminate the gun control language from the 375-page bill that would add some $ 2 billion to the nation's $ 3.9 billion war on drugs His proposed substitute would establish a system for gun sellers to run a check by phone or other means, to determine if a purchaser is a convicted felon. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also is wrestling with a number of other domestic and foreign issues this week: abortion, insider trading, job leave, sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, child care, welfare reform and textile import curbs. The House drug bill likely will receive a final vote Thursday or Friday. Last week, those favoring the harshest possible penalties, won amendment battles that attached provisions for a federal death penalty, denial of government benefits for twice convicted drug users, and court admission of evidence seized illegally by police acting in `` good faith.'' Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, interviewed Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press,'' said he supports the change in evidence rules because `` time and again, because of some technical shortcoming _ the failure to dot an ` i' or cross a ` t,' an important drug kingpin or other criminal can be turned loose.'' He said he also supports provisions affecting government benefits, but opposes a change that would authorize the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to conduct covert operations against drug operations overseas. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narcotics </ORGANIZATION>, said on the same show the death penalty was morally wrong and would not deter `` bums that are dealing in drugs'' who attach little value to human life. He said it also would make it more difficult to obtain extraditions of drug suspects from countries opposed to the death penalty. Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, expressing his personal opinion, told reporter last week he supports the handgun waiting period. `` I ca n't see that it's an infringement on the rights of any law-abiding citizen to have a simple waiting period,'' he said. `` If you've got to have a gun right this minute, you've got to have some violent intent. A responsible person would n't mind waiting seven days.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has told lawmakers that criminals would obtain guns regardless of the waiting period, and that only law-abiding citizens would suffer from the delay. Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Okla </LOCATION>., will propose civil penalties of up to $ 10,000 per violation against those found to be in possession of small `` personal use'' amounts of marijuana, cocaine, and other controlled substances Proof of guilt for a civil offense only requires `` clear and convincing evidence,'' while a criminal conviction demands proof of guilt `` beyond a reasonable doubt.'' Conflicting amendments will be offered that could affect the drivers' licenses of anyone convicted of drug offenses, including possession. Rep. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., would provide up to $ 125 million over three years to states with drug enforcement programs that include license suspension or revocation for convicted drug offenders <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON> will counter with a plan to require withholding a portion of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> highway money from states failing to enact suspension or revocation provisions. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> must decide what to do with a $ 140 billion social programs spending bill that has but one area of disagreement between the two houses _ abortion. Senators previously passed the legislation with an expansion of the Medicaid program to cover abortions for rape and incest victims. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last Friday refused to accept that provision of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, Education, and <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> spending bill. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is expected to give final approval and send the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> a bill that would freeze this year's textile and apparel imports at 1987 levels and allow 1 percent annual growth thereafter. It would bar increases in non-rubber footwear import levels. Proponents say the measure, which President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is expected to veto, would save jobs in the import-ravaged textile and apparel industries. Critics contend the industry is no longer suffering. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, passage is expected for an insider trading measure which, for the first time, would make it possible for securities firms to be fined for violations committed by their employees. It also would increase prison terms and fines. Some key measures wo n't reach the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor this week. Supporters of a bill to guarantee unpaid, job-protected leave for new parents have postponed a planned vote this week as they continue to negotiate compromises. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has scheduled a Wednesday vote on House-passed legislation to impose harsh new sanctions on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, including a cut off of virtually all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment in the country because of its apartheid policy.

<HEAD>Disease Threatens Thousands As Flood Waters Recede</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Flood waters began to recede Sunday, and the government said it has received $ 236 million in aid to fight the destruction and disease caused by the worst floods in memory. Thousands of lives were threatened by diarrhea caused by drinking water contaminated with sewage and garbage washed up by raging flood waters, health officials said. More than 200,000 people have contracted the disease and at least 123 have died from it, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The disease kills by dehydration. As river levels began to fall after two weeks of flooding, many residents returned to their homes, said officials at the Flood Control Center. They said they expect the water level to drop quicky starting Monday. The floods covered three-quarters of the nation and 53 of the country's 64 districts, with a population of 30 million, said Information Minister <PERSON> Mahbubur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>. He said 866 people have died of drowning, snakebites and disease. The government figure is considered low, and newspapers estimate at least 1,532 people have died. `` The world has responded promptly and generously to our appeal for help to the flood victims,'' <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> told reporters. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pledged $ 150 million in aid on Saturday, in addition to $ 2.6 million committed earlier. More funds and relief supplies have arrived from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, among others, he said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has offerred 100 tents, 1,000 blankets and 100 tons of medicine, he said. <PERSON> Danielle </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, wife of the French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, will visit the flood-affected areas during her four-day tour starting Monday. <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> estimated the damage from flooding would exceed $ 1.4 billion and that 6,000 to 10,000 tons of grains stored in warehouses were damaged or destroyed by water. The government of <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> is struggling against a shortage of helicopters and boats to get food and medicines to people stranded in the countryside. Hundreds of volunteer organizations, many run by <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> missionaries, are aiding in the massive relief effort, but reporters have visited areas where the first relief supplies did not arrive until Saturday. `` We are pooling all our resources to ensure relief, but we do not have sufficient volunteers to reach all the places in a short while,'' <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> said. He said, however, that the country has enough food to meet immediate needs and that the government would ensure `` that nobody dies of starvation during the floods.'' <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> said he hoped the flooding of the past few weeks `` would be nature's last big slap to this impoverished nation this year.''

 A Greyhound bus driver collapsed and died at the wheel, sending his bus crashing into several trees on a freeway median while a passenger tried to bring it under control. Three people were injured. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, 60, collapsed with an apparent heart attack about 11 a.m. Friday near this town 45 miles south of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, a spokesman for Greyhound-Trailways Lines in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>.

The northbound bus began to veer into southbound lanes of Interstate 85, and <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> was unable to keep the bus on the road, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said. But he did keep the bus from crashing into oncoming traffic or overturning. The bus hit several trees in the median before stopping. Three of the 21 passengers were injured, including one woman who was in stable condition Sunday.

<TEXT>
 Consider yourself warned. A hefty helping of granola or whole-wheat bread could contain enough natural LSD to produce mild high. The dragons of fairy tales really may have existed, and a violent collision between <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and a swarm of comets is overdue. Welcome to the weird and wonderful world of the British Association for the <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION>, which concluded its annual meeting at <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, 50 miles northwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The association was established in 1831 to promote general interest in all branches of science. While it still produces some of the most important and advanced research in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, its annual meetings are also a forum for more far-fetched concepts, designed to stimulate debate. For example, eating eight to 10 slices of whole-wheat bread or a large bowl of granola or bran flakes in one sitting may induce a mild euphoria because of wheat's natural LSD content, said Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Conning </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. LSD, a popular hallucinogen in the 1960s, is produced naturally by ergot, a common fungal infestation of wheat that may survive food processing, Conning told the meeting. He said a high-bran diet could result in a daily consumption of 100 micrograms of LSD, or four times the minimum dose needed to produce an effect on an inexperienced user of the drug. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Unwin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Palaeontological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> told the conference the dragons of fairy tales may have existed. He said they were flying dinosaurs with 16-foot wingspans and dominated the skies 140 million years ago. Speaking of dinosaurs, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, said the only possible explanation for their extinction 65 million years ago was a six-mile wide asteroid hitting Earth with an explosive force equal to 100 million megatons of TNT. As proof, <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> cites the amount of the metallic chemical iridium in rocks laid down at that time. Iridium is rare in the Earth's crust, he said, and the high levels found in rocks of that era must have come from an extra-terrestrial source. Dr. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Clube </PERSON>, an astrophysicist at <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, warned that a collision between <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and a swarm of comets is overdue and will certainly happen within 100 years. In a worst-case scenario, it will produce effects similar to a nuclear war, he warned. Meanwhile, man's best friend got a new look at the meeting. Dr. <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackmann </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>'s Museum of the History of Science exhibited a computerized watchdog that uses ultrasound, or high-frequency sound waves, to detect intruders. <PERSON> Hackmann </PERSON> said the watchdog's snarl gets louder and louder as the intruder approaches, but he admitted the sound is more like a rumbling thunderstorm than a canine bark. `` There are hopes of improving that,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION>'s Professor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said a robot guide dog for the blind is in the early stages of development, but still needs refinements. The robot, which also uses ultrasound, could now guide a blind person along an uncluttered street, but would have trouble separating individual objects or people in crowded areas, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. `` Currently, robots are n't as smart as a year-old sheep,'' he lamented.

<TEXT>
 Unions vowed Sunday to shut down the capital and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s main cities to protest the government's use of force to break up an anti-government rally The strike, which will affect schools, banks, public transportation and government offices, is set for Monday. The labor unions said the walkout was in response to a police break-up of a rally on Friday that was part of a national strike to protest President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s economic reforms. Thirty-seven police officers were among the 113 people injured when police used tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon to disperse a crowd of 20,000 union members. `` The unusual and ferocious attack, unacceptable in a democracy, was perpetrated by forces of repression more interested in beating innocent demonstrators than guaranteeing the security of people and property,'' the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday. Teachers, bank clerks, bus drivers, construction workers, public employees and other groups in the capital, <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, and in the cities of <LOCATION> Cordoba </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mar </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Plata </PERSON> said they would stay off their jobs in support of the strike. The strike also has been endorsed by the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and leftist <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION>, Socialist, Intransigent and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> parties. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> said in a statement that his government would guarantee the `` security of the services of public transport throughout the country.'' The president's center-right <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> says security forces intervened in Friday's rally to stop fighting and vandalism that already had broken out. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s program of economic reforms are aimed at curbing inflation that has soared to 440 percent in the past year and a 14 percent unemployment rate. Personal incomes have declined for three straight years. The unions contend the anti-inflation plan <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> introduced in August does not allow wages to keep pace with cost-of-living increases and that the government must resort to repression to support an economic program that is unpopular. The 3.5 million union members also oppose <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s efforts to sell off inefficient state industries, which employ tens of thousands of union members.

<HEAD>Fight Brewing Over Harpers Ferry Battlefield</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANE M. ANDERSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HARPERS FERRY, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new battle is brewing at the site of one of the South's greatest victories in the Civil War, this time pitting federal historians trying to preserve the battlefield against local officials who want to make the land available for commercial development. The conflict centers on the battlefield where Gen. <PERSON> Stonewall </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> led 14,000 Confederate troops in a three-day siege in 1862, eventually forcing the 12,500-man Union army to give up, the North's largest surrender of the war. The battleground's location along a highway just outside <ORGANIZATION> Harpers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ferry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> makes it ideal for development. Harpers Ferry is at the easternmost tip of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, just an hour's drive from the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> metropolitan area and its booming real estate market. National Park Service officials, however, want to preserve it as it was during the Civil War. `` It all happened right there,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, Harpers Ferry national park supervisor. `` It's a highly significant piece of American history _ it's certainly the most important battlefield in the state of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. `` It's just inappropriate to go in there and start digging with bulldozers. Young soldiers fought and died for their country on that land.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, however, recently zoned the privately owned land for high-density housing. Commission President <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said the panel did n't see any reason to hold back the land. `` The federal and the state governments own a large hunk of <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> already,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. `` You ca n't keep taking land off the tax books and expect to survive. `` There was a lot of Civil War activity in <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. If we set aside every piece of land in <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> that Civil War troops fought on, we would n't have anything left.'' The park service ca n't control what is done with land outside its jurisdiction and therefore must appeal to the county and state governments to fight development, <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. `` Preserving anything is up to the people,'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. `` If the people want it preserved, history will be preserved. If they do n't, history will be lost. We can only raise the issue.'' The dispute at Harpers Ferry is not the only battle over development at a Civil War site around <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Plans to construct a shopping mall outside the <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Battlefield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, site of two important battles, have drawn strong opposition. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said the commission's zoning ruling on the Harpers Ferry site is not necessarily permanent. `` We're certainly willing to listen,'' he said. The park service and the Harpers Ferry town government already have enacted easements sharply restricting construction in sight of the historic town, where abolitionist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> conducted his infamous raid in 1859 when <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> was still part of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. The town, much of it preserved in pre-Civil War condition, is one of the state's top tourist attractions. `` We adopted the plan to restrict ourselves,'' said Harpers Ferry Mayor <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>. `` The mass majority of the people like what we have _ we do n't want townhouses or apartment houses in the town.'' But <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> said attempts to build in the area surrounding the park have provoked `` a continuing battle'' between local government and the park service. `` They do n't want any development anywhere,'' <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> said.

 The driving range of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s first golf course opened Sunday in a ceremony attended by dignitaries ranging from heavyweight boxing champion <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> to a leading Russian Orthodox clergyman. The golf course, near the Swedish Embassy in south <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, is a project organized by former Swedish hockey player <PERSON> Sven </PERSON> <PERSON> Tumba </PERSON> and Soviet sports officials. Those who attended the opening said they were seeking peace through sports. `` I'm sure that sports promotes friendship and I'm deeply convinced that the birth of a new game in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will bring about new contacts among people in various countries who will find a lot of new friends,'' <PERSON> Tumba </PERSON> said, according to a report by the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>.

Among the others who attended the ceremony were <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> and Metropolitan Pitirim of the Russian Orthodox Church, who said sports help people understand what they have in common. Plans call for a nine-hole course along the <LOCATION> Setun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> with double tees on each hole, allowing it to be used as an 18-hole, par-68 course. The plans also include rental and sales of golf equipment, a Russian-language instructor, a clubhouse with restaurant and a business club with a conference room and secretarial services. A pro-am tournament tentatively has been scheduled for September 1989.

 Newly crowned Miss America <PERSON> Gretchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, a classical violinist and <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student with hopes of law school, said Sunday she plans to become a corporate executive. `` I'm definitely an overachiever,'' she told reporters. `` This was n't luck,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, entered in the pageant as Miss <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, said of her selection as Miss America 1989. She added that she is not superstitious and brought no good-luck charms to the pageant. Miss <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Anoka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, performed a spirited violin solo titled `` Gypsy Airs.'' She has been studying violin for 17 years, winning national and state competitions and performing a solo with the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Orchestra. After winning a preliminary talent competition last week, she confidently told reporters parts of her performance were `` exquisite.'' Pageant officials took pains this year to emphasize that the judges were looking for an `` articulate, educated, dynamic role model'' and not a beauty queen. Miss <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> was crowned early Sunday by her predecessor, <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> <PERSON> Lani </PERSON> <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafko </PERSON>. The selection of Miss America 1989 was delayed almost 12 minutes when judges had to cast new ballots to break a tie for second runner-up. During the delay, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said, `` I'd lost confidence. ... I really thought it was all over at that point. I saw a judge look down at a book and look at a picture and shake their head and I thought, ` Oh, no, it's me!''' Miss <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> is several credits away from graduating from <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> with a degree in organizational behavior. She said she would like to attend <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> `` and become a successful corporate executive.'' For the next year, she will tour the country promoting not only the Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> scholarship program but also the products of the pageant's corporate sponsors, including underwear, orange juice, pantyhose and hair coloring. Miss <PERSON> Rafko </PERSON>, a registered nurse, used her reign to promote the nursing field. Miss <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said she would like to focus on `` education for the children of tomorrow.'' Specifically, she would like to see children receive more education on values, `` teaching children to be less narcissistic.'' `` Today children tend to be more in love with themselves instead of being in love with other people,'' she said. When asked what kind of <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> she would make, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> laughed and replied: `` A short one.'' She stands 5-foot-3. Miss <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, a green-eyed blonde of Swedish descent, admitted she lightens her hair with hair coloring but said contestants `` should not be allowed to change their bodies'' through cosmetic surgery, as some have. Miss <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said that when she was 16 she weighed about 128 pounds. She now weighs 108. `` When I used to be fat, my brothers used to call me ` blimpo,''' she said. `` I wanted to go out with the star basketball player at school and he said, ` She's such a nice girl but she's just a little too plump.' `` So I went on this major diet and lost all this weight and then he wanted to go out with me, but I said no.'' Miss <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> also said she would like to see the Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> pageant include a scholarship category.

<TEXT>
 Yellowstone National Park Superintendent <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON> says critics of the park's fire policy who blame the policy for major forest fires are directing a `` lynch-mob, hang-him mentality'' at him. Critics have `` an hysteric view that the area is on fire because of a misguided fire policy,'' he said in an interview Saturday. `` Such a view, that the entire American West is on fire because of a fire policy, is ridiculous.'' <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON> was disputing recent comments by firefighters and residents of park gateway communities that the Yellowstone fires could have been put out early if he had let firefighters use heavy equipment such as bulldozers and chain saws. The national park fire management policy calls for minimal use of motorized and heavy equipment. <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON> said he `` absolutely feels fine'' that <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> supported <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s fire management practices during his tour of the fires Saturday. But <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said Sunday in <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, that the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s 16-year-old `` let burn'' policy did n't work under this year's extremely dry `` The old policy has to be reviewed and altered,'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said at the <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which coordinates fire suppression throughout the country. `` Nobody who has seen it operate this year could say it was a success.'' During the 16 years, 16,000 fires burned a total of about 30,000 acres in the park, <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said. But currently, nearly 900,000 acres of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s 2.2 million acres are involved in flame. `` We'll see a new policy in place before the beginning of the next fire year,'' he said. Until then, each new fire will be suppressed with all the equipment and manpower available. <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON> said he and other firefighting professionals `` have nothing to apologize for.'' `` The very idea staggers me that people boo the efforts made to control the fires,'' he said. `` The best firefighting technology in the world is being used here.'' <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON> said he is `` sorry that people can not accept the fact that conditions are so extreme'' and make firefighting difficult. Tourism will not decline in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> because of the fires, <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON> insisted. He said people will continue to visit the park to see the thermal features such as the geysers and the wildlife. <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON> said that in the past the park has not purposely lit fires to get rid of dead lodgepole pines that have helped fuel the fires because it is n't a practical method to get rid of dead trees. Under normal weather conditions, lodgepole pines, which covered 80 percent of the park before the fires, `` do not burn quickly and easily,'' he said. And <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s rugged terrain does not make it easy to control planned burns, he added. Anyone who thinks planned burns would have prevented the present fire problems, he said, is `` chewing lotus seeds.''

 A book published earlier this year predicts that a prelude to the end of the world will begin this week, with millions of the faithful suddenly, silently called to Heaven and global disasters following. The prospect increased attendance Sunday at some churches, the book has been a best-seller and some people have even quit their jobs in preparation for the End. `` The Lord is coming back. I'm looking at it about any time now,'' <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> McLamb </PERSON>, 37, of Coats, said Sunday. He and workers at his automobile engine shop had rushed to complete customers' orders last week. `` Will it happen? I'm not a date-setter ... but I'm not a fool, either,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Allman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, who urged worshipers in a sermon Sunday to `` check out their priorities.'' He said he knew of several people who had quit their jobs in recent weeks or taken leaves of absence in preparation, and his church attendance has doubled in recent weeks. `` This has made them understand that in a flash this could all be over,'' he said. The excitement stems from a prediction made by <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wisenant </PERSON> in his book, `` 88 Reasons Why The Rapture Will Be In 1988.'' Wisenant, a former <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> rocket engineer, uses mathematical calculations and biblical interpretation to pinpoint the beginning of the end to the 48 hours of this year's Jewish New Year _ 40 years and 120 days after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> became a nation on May 14, 1948. The Jewish celebration runs from sunset Sunday to sunset Tuesday. `` That's when the fires and famines are supposed to begin, plagues and sickness like AIDS,'' said <PERSON> Geneva </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitley </PERSON>, 66, of <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON>. The plagues will end in November 1995, when <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> returns, <PERSON> Wisenant </PERSON> says. Interest in the event has mushroomed so much that lately some Christian bookstores have reported being unable to keep <PERSON> Wisenant </PERSON>'s book in stock `` We've sold well over 1,000 since the second week in July,'' said <PERSON> Joanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, co-owner of the Sign Of The Fish bookstores in the <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> area. Some stores received free shipments of the $ 2 paperback last week from its publisher, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, and were giving them away. `` I've spent over $ 200,000 personally in trying to get the word out to the faithful,'' the Bible society's publisher, <PERSON> Norville </PERSON> <PERSON> Olive </PERSON>, told The News and Observer of <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Blinson </PERSON> of <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> said he paid more than $ 1,000 for books and for advertising time on a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> radio station in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, to warn people. But not everyone who believes in the return of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> says that his visit is at hand. `` I just do n't feel that the Lord is ready to destroy the earth,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Avery </PERSON>, whose husband is pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Asheville </LOCATION>. She said Missionary Baptist churches, like many mainstream denominations, teach that <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> will return and Christians will go to Heaven, but `` we are n't looking for it like that.'' Setting dates for the Second Coming of Christ began as early as the 14th century, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Megivern </PERSON>, chairman of the religion department at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>. He called it `` calendarizing,'' or taking the Bible to its most literal extremes by certain interpreters of biblical prophecy. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Efird </PERSON>, professor at <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Divinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said history has recorded numerous instances where people awaited <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s coming. In the early 1900s, he said, a group of <PERSON> Jehovah </PERSON>'s Witnesses dressed in white and stood on the Mount of Olives to greet him. And around 1844, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> preacher <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> gathered a group of Adventists in white robes twice to await the end of the world.

But the racers, well, you might say they were sluggish. Slick, Slither and Sturgeon Lips were among the 55 contestants in Saturday's race. They were weighed and measured, and then the action started.

 Palestinian activists stabbed and seriously wounded an Arab physician Sunday and the army said attackers threw acid in the faces of two other <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> doctors who allegedly collaborated with Israeli authorities. Israeli officials voiced concern about the surge of attacks in which four suspected collaborators were killed in the past week. `` We are monitoring the situation very carefully because in this phase, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> violence has increasingly turned against Palestinians,'' said Col. <PERSON> Raanan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON>, an army spokesman. Israelis prayed in synagogues and enjoyed picnics in celebration of the Jewish New Year, <LOCATION> Rosh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hashana </LOCATION>, that began Sunday. Police and military units were reinforced for the holiday as violence continued in the nine-month-old <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. One of <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>'s chief rabbis, <PERSON> Shaar </PERSON> <PERSON> Yashuv </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, ruled that worshipers can carry handguns into synagogues if they are concealed, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, in a message to the armed forces, said the coming year `` did not promise peace and quiet.'' Hospital officials said 13 Palestinians were wounded Sunday in clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. They said eight were wounded by army gunfire in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s Shati refugee camp and the five others were wounded in and around the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. The army said it was checking the reports. In response to the latest attacks on Arabs suspected of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, six members of the Israeli-appointed municipal council in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Yatta </LOCATION> resigned, saying they feared for their lives. The seventh council member, Mayor <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemeid </PERSON>, remained in his post. `` We saw what happened to people who did n't obey the orders of the uprising leaders,'' council member <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabha </PERSON> said. Two weeks ago, a suspected collaborator was hacked to death in <LOCATION> Yatta </LOCATION>. The latest leaflet from the pro-PLO <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Uprising </ORGANIZATION> called on Palestinians to `` rid ourselves of collaborators and go after those who have not resigned from their jobs with the Israeli government.'' Meanwhile, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bloc </ORGANIZATION> called on <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states to form a Palestinian negotiating team not connected with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace talks. `` I think it's possible with the assistance of neighboring Arab countries, which by a joint effort can succeed in establishing an authorized and convincing -LRB- Palestinian -RRB- representation,'' he said.

The latest fatality was reported Sunday by the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, which said the body of <PERSON> Issa </PERSON> <PERSON> Yasin </PERSON>, 30, a suspected collaborator, was found in the village <LOCATION> Anin </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION> over the weekend.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> came under attack by opposition leaders Sunday and warned the parliament that a vote of no-confidence in his new government will hamper <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s post-war recovery `` For the sake of the country ... we must all try to be flexible,'' said <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>, addressing the 270-member Majlis, or parliament, before it began discussing his 21-man Cabinet, according to <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>. The radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said four members of the opposition criticized the new government while five representatives praised it. The official <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> news agency said the confidence vote, set earlier for Sunday, would be postponed a day. The <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> report said the <ORGANIZATION> Majlis </ORGANIZATION> will `` listen to remarks of the government's representative in defense of the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers before casting their votes for or against the Cabinet.'' Divisions that have plagued the Iranian leadership for years sharpened after <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s abrupt July 18 acceptance of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s cease-fire resolution in the 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> agreed to the cease-fire after a string of military defeats. Diplomatic sources said <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> opposed the cease-fire, which began Aug. 20. The acceptance was believed to have been masterminded by <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, speaker of the parliament and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s military commander, the second most powerful figure in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. The parliamentary debate Sunday was on the government <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> announced in July after parliamentary elections in April and May. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said the debate focused on the ministries of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION>, the Islamic Revolution's <ORGANIZATION> Guards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, Agriculture, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> and Social Affairs as well as Post Telegraph and Telephones. The prime minister warned if his ministers do not win a vote of confidence `` their offices will remain virtually vacant'' until presidential elections scheduled for next year. <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>, 46, submitted his resignation to President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> on Monday, claiming that as many as eight of his ministers faced no-confidence votes in parliament. He retracted his resignation Tuesday night after <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> rejected it and <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> publicly rebuked him for making the surprise move at such a critical juncture while <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was negotiating a peace settlement with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>, a radical who favors tight state control of the economy, opposes bringing in foreign companies to help <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> rebuild. He has warned that would drive <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, its economy bled dry by the war, deep into debt. He is opposed by <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, who has close links with the merchant class and conservative clerics, and <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, the leading advocate of ending <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s isolation by improving links with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. Some Western economists estimate reconstruction will cost <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> around $ 40 billion. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has foreign reserves estimated at $ 5 billion, but owes around 2 billion dollars. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, like <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, is expected to boost its oil production, currently restricted by an <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>, to pay its reconstruction bill. But that would drive oil prices down.

Beard, 49, was the underdog in a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary Saturday that pitted him against heavily financed Lt. Gov. S.B. Woo, 51. <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> did not have a primary opponent. Campaign finance reports filed in late August showed Woo having raised $ 407,998, Beard with $ 65,008 and <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> with $ 734,933. Several small precincts did not plan to report voting results until Monday, but with 97 percent of the vote counted, Beard had 22,418, or 53 percent, to Woo's 19,624, or 47 percent. A little over 30 percent of the 133,386 Democrats eligible to vote turned out. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which includes <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, helped push Beard over the top, as he won his home county with 17,001 to Woo's 13,296. Beard, who inherited his wealth, had the support of party loyalists and unions. Woo, of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, was a champion of Asian-Americans nationwide and had the support of the college set.

Among issues he said voters agreed with him on was foreign investment, which he said Woo `` was prepared to encourage.'' `` I've spent all my life creating jobs here, building industry. We need to increase our exports. I do not encourage foreign investors purchasing our farms or our businesses,'' <PERSON> Beard </PERSON> said. `` We ran a campaign on broad issues.

 Kurdish refugees at a camp near this eastern city cited a litany of ailments they said they suffered when the Iraqi army drove them from their villages with poison gas. `` My whole body itches, one of my eyes is blinded, I have trouble breathing,'' <PERSON> Iskender </PERSON> <PERSON> Omer </PERSON>, 58, said Sunday. He said he and other refugees left the town of <LOCATION> Zahor </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> 20 days ago when Iraqi planes began dropping chemical bombs on their village. `` They made very little noise, these bombs, a yellow smoke emanated from them and a foul, garlic-like smell was in the air,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> from his bed in one the 500 tents set up to house the refugees. Mustard gas is distinguishable by its garlic-like smell. He and his 30-year-old son <PERSON> Halil </PERSON> <PERSON> Iskender </PERSON> said many people from their village died because they were closer to where the bombs fell. The two said they saved themselved by throwing themselves into an irrigation canal. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has accused <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of using chemical weapons against its Kurdish minority. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Friday approved economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, which has given sanctuary to about 60,000 Kurds fleeing the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> attacks, said Friday no evidence of chemical weapons use was found in screening the sick and injured among the refugees. The Turkish government set up a clinic with 10 doctors and 25 nurses in the camp, which houses 8,000 refugees. Doctors say they have not determined that any of the deaths among the refugees or the symptoms of illnesses among the refugees were caused by poison gas. `` These people have been on the road for days, they suffer from exhaustion and various infections, including eye infections,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Sinan </PERSON> <PERSON> Seyfioglu </PERSON>. <PERSON> Seyfioglu </PERSON> believes their findings from the refugees neither confirm or deny the use of chemical weapons. `` This does not mean <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> did not use poison gas. But if these people had been exposed, I do n't believe they could make it over here,'' he said. But Kurdish guerrillas in the camp near <LOCATION> Diyarbakir </LOCATION> said they would still be in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> fighting if they did not have to escape from chemical bomb attacks. They showed a 3 -LCB- - year-old boy, <PERSON> Isa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON>, and said scabs covering his entire face are the result of poison gas `` Where we come from, birds no longer fly, even the animals are dead,'' said <PERSON> Cemal </PERSON> <PERSON> Salih </PERSON>, wearing the baggy brown pants which is the uniform of the Peshmergas, the Kurdish guerrillas. `` We ran without burying our dead,'' he said. He said, along with others, that he was willing to go back and show the dead bodies to observers if it were possible.

He said Mrs. <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> <PERSON> Juarez </PERSON> told police several people were in the cab. <PERSON> Tezonapa </PERSON> is a town of about 7,000 people about 50 miles from the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Veracruz </LOCATION>, the state capital 190 miles east of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Licona </PERSON> spoke in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Gilberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Rincon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON>, national leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, told the liberal <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jornada </ORGANIZATION> that the shooting appeared to be politically motivated.

 Thousands of leftists battled police Sunday after an emotional memorial service to Marxist President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, who perished in the military coup that overthrew his government 15 years ago. An estimated 5,000 people paid homage at the modest tomb in a cemetery in this coastal resort. When the service ended bands of militants marched out of the cemetery and were confronted by ranks of helmeted riot police. The police used tear gas, clubs and water cannons to disperse the marchers. Several people were arrested and reporters saw a few demonstrators injured, including a young man bleeding from the head after being clubbed by two policemen. Officials did not give any figures on the numbers of arrests or injured. It was the largest graveside tribute to <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> who was buried in the suburban cemetery a day after his death during the Sept. 11, 1973, coup led by Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the army commander who then became president. The regional government in <LOCATION> Vina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mar </LOCATION>, 75 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, had authorized only a brief procession and when the militants attemped to march on the city center the police blocked them. According to the military government, <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> shot himself in the head with a carbine that was a gift from <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> as the Presidential Palace was in flames and under attack by troops. <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> had declared he would not allow himself to be deposed and taken out of the palace alive, and the military version is accepted by most Chileans and historians. But his followers said after the coup he was killed by police or soldiers who shot their way into his office. The military government had barred the placing of a tombstone with <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>'s name at the grave, but on Sunday there was a small marble plaque with the inscription: `` <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Allende </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gossens </LOCATION>, June 26, 1908 _ September 11, 1973. President of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, 1970-1073. Tribute of the Chilean <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' Groups of people began arriving at the cemetery in midmorning, many placing red and white carnations at the tomb. By noon, some 5,000 people had gathered and a carpet of carnations covered the tomb. A man in his 20s stood beside the tomb for a few minutes and then collapsed, sobbing. Many other mourners also wept. The crowd was quiet as loudspeakers broadcast a recording of <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>'s last speech on the day of the coup. `` You do n't stop social processes with crime or by force,'' he said, speaking through by telephone from the besieged palace to the only <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> radio station that not been taken over by the military. Gunfire and explosions could be heard in the background. After the recording people in the crowd chanted, `` We can feel it, we can feel it, Allende is here.'' They also shouted, `` Pinochet is going to fall, the dictatorship is going to fall.'' Attending the service were a grandson of Allende, <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Meza </PERSON>, and a niece, <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Pascal </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>'s daughter, Isabel, who returned to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> Sept. 1 when the government ended the official exile of about 500 leftists, was not present. She had visited the grave privately last week and on Saturday.

 A huge mass of fans pressed to the stage during a <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> concert Sunday, and more than 1,550 people were reported injured in the crush, authorities said. Most injuries were minor, but officials said 40 people required hospital treatment. Mounted police and vanloads of uniformed officers in riot gear were called to the <LOCATION> Aintree </LOCATION> horse racing track, where 125,000 attended the final concert of the singer's European tour, police said. Police said about 22 people were arrested for disorderly conduct. First-aid workers said they treated an estimated 3,400 fans during the concert for a variety of injuries. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Crook </PERSON>, <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ambulance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION> assistant commissioner, said 1,550 of the casualties were treated after being crushed at the front of the crowd near the stage because of the pressure of people behind them. He said several of the casualties were people who fainted in the crush. Crook said one of the 40 the fans requiring hospital treatment suffered a suspected fractured spine. `` We are really surprised by the number of casualties but out of an audience of 125,000 I suppose it is n't too bad,'' Crook said. At one point trouble flared outside the arena when youths without tickets, which cost $ 27 each, tried to pull down fences to get a view of the show. Reporters said they saw mounted police and officers in riot gear hurry to the scene and arrest several youths. In another incident, youths pelted concert ushers with rocks. Earlier reports indicated that the concert crush was caused by the youths trying to enter the concert area, but <PERSON> Crook </PERSON> said there were no reported injuries when fans without tickets tried to enter the concert arena. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, managing director of co-promoters <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION>, said the casualties seemed exagerrated. `` I think it has gone very well and the local council and the police seem perfectly happy with it,'' he said. Local councilman <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said: `` I think it has gone excellently and above our expectations. `` We would expect some problems with a 125,000 crowd and we are very pleased with how it went. We look forward to the next concert at <LOCATION> Aintree </LOCATION>, be it <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>, The Rolling Stones, or anyone,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. The rock superstar began his European tour May 23, in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>.

 Seven campers armed with four shotguns, an automatic rifle and several handguns allegedly took three people captive and forced them to dig a pit for a pig roast, authorities said. The seven men were arrested by 14 officers from several law enforcement agencies who crept up to the campsite in the mountains north of here and surrounded it Saturday, said Undersheriff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON>. There were no injuries. Seven people were charged with reckless endangerment, possession of drugs and possession of drug paraphernalia. The suspects, whose names were n't released Sunday, possessed substances believed to be hallucinogenic mushrooms and LSD, <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> said. He would n't say whether they were under the influence of the drugs at the time of their arrest. The captives, whose names also were n't released, apparently stumbled onto the campsite and did n't know their captors, <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> said. The hostages may have been taken as early as Friday evening. The sheriff's office said it got a tip Saturday morning, and verified it by flying over the area. <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> said a dead pig was left at the site, but was n't roasted

 An 11-year-old boy who was shot by a passing motorist as he sat outside his home said Sunday he's afraid to go outside again. `` I do n't think I'm gon na go out on my steps,'' <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON> <PERSON> Garvin </PERSON> said. `` The only time I'm gon na sit on my steps is if there's a lot of people out there I know ... and I'm talking about a lot.'' The boy was the latest victim in a string of stabbings and shootings in the city that <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> police have blamed, in part, on an increase in street gangs, dozens of which they say are trafficking drugs and guns. The Aug. 19 death of <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, 11, who police said was sitting on a corner mailbox talking with friends when she was caught in a cross-fire of rival drug dealers, galvanized <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION> residents, who called for an increased police presence in their neighborhood. Sterling also lives in <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION>, a predominantly black, low-income section of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> with about 50,000 residents. Sterling and two friends were talking after dinner Thursday when a red car with tinted windows pulled up to the curb and fired a single gunshot. `` I heard somebody say ` Wow!' Then I see a hole in my pants,'' <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON> said. But he said he only felt a pinch and did n't believe he had been shot. `` I kept saying, ` I did n't get shot''cause it did n't hurt,'' he said. He was taken to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where doctors bandaged his left thigh but decided to not remove the .22 - caliber `` They ai n't gon na take it out'cause if they did take it out it'd damage my leg,'' <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON> explained as he rested on his mother's bed, fingering the hospital bracelet he still wears. Sterling's mother, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON>, wants to remove the threat of violence. After living in the same four rooms for six years, the <PERSON> Garvin </PERSON> family is looking for a new home. `` It's been the worst time of my life,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Garvin </PERSON>, who emigrated from <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> 14 years ago. `` We had a fire above us a few months ago and my son got shot, so I think it's time to move out.'' His mother and several cousins said they believed he was either shot randomly or was mistaken for someone else. Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> went to <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON>'s hospital room and spoke with the boy and his mother on the night <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON> was shot. `` He's 11 years old, <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> was 11 years old and I have a daughter who's 11 years old. It really has to break your heart,'' <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said.

 From remote ocean outposts to an African rally for Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, the world put on its running shoes Sunday to raise money for starving children in the second annual Sport Aid `` Race Against Time.'' Reports indicated up to 50 million people worldwide took part in the series of six-mile marathons that organizers called `` a petition of blistered feet.'' It has been billed as the largest participation event in history. `` This is the people's Olympics, when everybody around the world can be a champion,'' said race spokesman <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cater </PERSON>. `` For many, this is as near as they're ever going to make it to saving lives.'' He said it may be weeks before Sport Aid knows how much money was raised. The race began at dawn local time Monday in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Tonga </LOCATION> _ `` the land where time begins'' _ and continued Sunday as the sun set over the Great Pyramids in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, Cater said. Police riding camels supervised the race near <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> where about 8,000 men, women and children ran a course past the 4,500-year-old Sphinx and the pyramids. Balloons and fireworks marked the start of the run by some 50,000 people in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hyde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, official races took place in 15 major cities. The first Sport Aid race flopped in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because it coincided with a nationwide `` Hands Across America'' campaign to raise funds for the poor and homeless. Young and old donned `` I Changed The World'' T-shirts Sunday in an enlarged rerun of Sport Aid, which on May 25, 1986, attracted nearly 20 million runners in 89 countries and raised $ 35 million for African famine victims. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, about 220 boys and girls from more than 100 participating nations jogged up <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s First Avenue to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> headquarters with Sudanese athlete <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalifa </PERSON>, who lighted an Olympic-style flame to start the race. In <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, the pope sent off dozens of young runners with words of advice during a rally at Glamis Stadium. The pope arrived in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> Saturday to start a five-nation, 10-day tour of southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` Continue always to live in the love of God and to love one another from the heart. Then the race against time shall be for our world not only a race against hunger and disease but also a race for goodness and right, a race of love that gives us all new hope and joy,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said. Broadcast live in six languages to a potential audience of 1.5 billion people, with satellite TV and radio link-ups to 23 cities, Sport Aid raised money from sponsors of runners, from ticket sales to races and from sideline events for charities in mainly underdeveloped nations. One-fifth of the funds raised in each developed country will go to poor and disabled children in that country. The rest goes to Third World countries. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Children's Fund estimates nearly 15 million children die each year from hunger and easily preventable diseases. Two Soviet cosmonauts orbiting the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> in the Mir space station broadcast a message of support, and six hours of TV coverage worldwide included excerpts of carnivals and concerts from <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>. All 58 residents of <LOCATION> Pitcairn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> pledged to run, as did 2 million people in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Other fund-raising events included a cross-country ski by British marines in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, and ship-deck runs by passengers on the ocean liner <LOCATION> Canberra </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> and by oil workers on tankers in the Gulf of <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>. Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> lit a flame in a <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION> field to begin a relay race by government ministers. At dusk, a dozen free-fall army parachutists heralded the start of the race in <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> by descending into <LOCATION> Muscat </LOCATION>'s Sultan Qaboos Stadium. In <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, about 600 people coursed mainly through desert, starting an hour earlier in 100-degree Fahrenheit temperatures to finish before nightfall. <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> organized a run alongside the flood-swollen <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, also devastated by floods, postponed its race at least until next month, organizers said.

 Tens of thousands of Iraqis paraded past the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday to denounce a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> call for sanctions in response to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s alleged use of poison gas against Kurdish rebels. `` <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION>, Shame, Shame,'' the protesters chanted in English as they marched past the embassy. Members of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> exhorted them through loudspeakers. `` We will never forget <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> evil,'' read one banner. `` No to intervention in our affairs,'' read another in both Arabic and English. `` Down with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>,'' said another banner, referring to close <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, whose parliament is called the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>. About 20,000 marchers filed past the embassy for two hours. The crowd was orderly, even cheerful, and there was no apparent threat to the embassy. One ranking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat stood on the sidewalk a few feet from the march and watched it move by. <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said in a statement Sunday that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> `` aims to divert the attention of the international media from the uprising in the occupied territories.'' Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> strip have been rioting against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s military occupation for the past nine months. <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> said the fighting with the Kurdish `` insurgents'' lasted at most two days and no serious battles were involved. He reiterated the charge that the tens of thousand of Kurds who fled across the Iraqi border to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> were forced by Kurdish rebels, who were seeking publicity for their cause. Kurdish rebels said that as many as 60,000 Iraqi troops attacked their positions in the northern mountains after the Aug. 20 cease-fire with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the eight-year gulf war. The rebels of the Kurdish <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said 2,000 Kurdish civilians were killed and 5,000 wounded, many in chemical weapon attacks. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted Friday to demand economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> after Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> declared that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used chemical weapons, outlawed under a 1925 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> treaty, against its northern Kurdish population. The measure, still before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, would have to be signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> before taking effect. It was designed to make it difficult for <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to obtain international credit to pay off its estimated $ 60 billion war debt. Well before the latest Iraqi assault on the Kurds, a number of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> investigations concluded that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> _ and to a lesser extent, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> _ had engaged in chemical warfare since 1984. `` Let the American <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION> and its masters understand that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is not a country that can be subject to threats. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which seeks sincere and honorable relations with all, is ready to spit on all insincere approaches,'' said an editorial in <ORGANIZATION> Al-Thawra </ORGANIZATION>, urging Iraqis to take to the streets. It was not signed, but it carried the tag line often used by President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> himself: `` To hell with the villains.'' The army newspaper <PERSON> Al-Qadissiyeh </PERSON> denounced the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote with banner headlines. The attacks were the strongest on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since the two countries restored relations in 1984. They were severed after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supported <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> also said Sunday he turned down an offer by unidentified people in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to trade 100 U.S.-made artillery pieces for an advanced Soviet tank <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had during the war. In a speech broadcast on state-run television, the president did not specify who offered the 175mm guns for the T-72 tank but said his intelligence chief conducted negotiations for them in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He hinted the talks took place in 1982 after some countries banned arms sales to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> banned arms sales to both sides during the war, although administration officials violated that policy by selling arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in an effort to improve relations and free American hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In a related development, the <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported that 11,517 Kurds accepted the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> government's offer of amnesty for supporting <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war and any other actions against the government. The report, quoting unidentified officials, said Kurds were `` pouring through the gates of the borders.'' Newspapers in neighboring <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> also attacked the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote. Editorials in pro-government papers said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> campaign was inspired by the `` Zionist lobby'' in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Kuwaiti papers said <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states could replace any funding denied through international institutions because of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> veto.

<HEAD>Detroit's Child Homicide Rate Nation's Worst</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Children under 17 were more than twice as likely to die violently in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> than in other major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities in recent years, according to a study. <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s juvenile homicide rate jumped to more than three times the overall rate in the nation's 10 largest cities by 1986, according to a study commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Guns alone have accounted for 37 deaths of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> youths so far this year, compared with 35 fatal shootings for all of 1987. Drugs, crumbling families and inattention to children drew much of the blame for the juvenile homicide rate in the nation's sixth-largest city, which declined in only one year between 1979 and 1986 `` We do n't love our children enough,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Rosalind </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> psychiatrist. `` With a homicide rate like this, it can be said that we do n't cherish or think of them as the future.'' The Free Press, citing a computer study it commissioned of <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> crime statistics from 1979 through 1986 and related research, said <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s juvenile homicide rate during that period was 2.7 per 100,000 residents. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> was second at 1.9 per 100,000, followed by <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> with 1.6 per 100,000. The overall rate for the nation's 10 largest cities was 1.3 per 100,000. <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s juvenile homicide rate reached 4.1 per 100,000 in 1986, the latest year for which figures were available. That rate was more than three times the 1986 rate in the 10 largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities, 1.3 per 100,000. <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> also had the highest overall homicide rate, 47 per 100,000 residents, among the 10 largest cities in 1979-86. <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> was a distant second with 31.7 murders per 100,000, the newspaper said.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Men armed with guns and machetes burst into the church of a militant Roman Catholic priest Sunday and killed at least three parishioners, wounded 60 and burned down the building, witnesses and news reports said. Police stood near the church but none came to the rescue, witnesses said. After the attack, gangs of men roamed the deserted streets and stoned the offices of two groups opposed to the military regime of Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>. The Rev. <PERSON> Jean-Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>, an outspoken opponent of the military government, had just begun a 9 a.m. -LRB- 9 a.m. EDT -RRB- Mass when a group of men began throwing rocks at the church, panicking hundreds inside who rushed for the doors, said a foreign journalist attending the service. `` Suddenly the doors at the back of the church burst open and 20 to 30 men with machetes, huge sticks and guns came in. They were dressed in civilian clothes,'' said the journalist, who contacted The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> by telephone. `` They started shooting people, beating them, and stabbing and slashing them,'' the reporter said. `` They stabbed a woman who was pregnant. They stabbed another man who ran outside the church. He died. Some people were shot.'' Estimates of the numbers of parishioners in the church, inside a compound ringed by a wall, ranged from 600 to 1,500.

 Police are using the fight against gang violence to legitimize abuse of people's civil rights, an <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> official said. `` Under the guise of the gang crisis in our community, innocent people are being harassed and rights are being infringed upon. We are desperate to correct that,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Essex </PERSON>, local chapter president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People. <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION> spoke Saturday at an NAACP-sponsored hearing on allegations of police misconduct. `` We should n't have to be concerned about the fact that when we call for protection, we have to be subjected to the same degradation inflicted on common criminals,'' <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, one of a half-dozen people who spoke at the hearing, said she found herself on the floor with a gun pointed at her head one night when she answered a knock at her door. She was held down by a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's deputy while six other officers searched her apartment for cocaine, she said. When no drugs were found and she had been questioned, she said, the deputies realized the vehicles they had been watching actually belonged to someone next door. `` I just could n't believe this was happening to me. I felt as if I was watching this happen to someone else,'' she said. `` I do n't bother anybody I do n't use drugs or associate with people who do. I do n't even like to drink.'' Cmdr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said the police have support from the general community. `` It was n't that long ago that the community was demanding more police officers to do something about rising gang violence,'' he said. `` And the community is safer than it was before we started saturating the community with police officers.''

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Men armed with guns and machetes burst into the church of a militant Roman Catholic priest Sunday and killed at least three parishioners, wounded 60 and burned down the building, witnesses and news reports said. Police stood near the church but none came to the rescue, witnesses said. After the attack, gangs of men roamed the deserted streets and stoned the offices of two groups opposed to the military regime of Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>. The Rev. <PERSON> Jean-Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>, an outspoken opponent of the military government, had just begun a 9 a.m. -LRB- 9 a.m. EDT -RRB- Mass when a group of men began throwing rocks at the church, panicking hundreds inside who rushed for the doors, said a foreign journalist attending the service. `` Suddenly the doors at the back of the church burst open and 20 to 30 men with machetes, huge sticks and guns came in. They were dressed in civilian clothes,'' said the journalist, who contacted The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> by telephone. `` They started shooting people, beating them, and stabbing and slashing them,'' the reporter said. `` They stabbed a woman who was pregnant. They stabbed another man who ran outside the church. He died. Some people were shot.'' Estimates of the numbers of parishioners in the church, inside a compound ringed by a wall, ranged from 600 to 1,500.

 Former <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> turned 71 Sunday, and was feted by supporters at a birthday bash that drew about 5,000 people. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who has lived in exile here since February 1986, was greeted by cheers and choruses of `` Happy Birthday to You ... Happy birthday, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>,'' when he and his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, arrives at the `` Philippine Day in the <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>,'' celebration. Supporters waved signs, one bearing <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' face and another showing <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> shaking hands with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The Marcoses sat on stage and were serenaded with traditional Filipino and contemporary songs. The all-day event at <ORGANIZATION> Blaisdell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arena </ORGANIZATION> was sponsored by the local group `` Friends of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazo </PERSON>, the group's president, said admission was free and open to the public. The celebration included food, entertainment and door prizes, including a new car. `` Everyone had so much fun last year we decided to do it again,'' <PERSON> Lazo </PERSON> said. Last year's celebration was billed as a non-political `` Prayer for Peace for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>.'' But the 6,000 supporters urged <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to try to regain power from <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> presented her husband with a gift of <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> soil, calling it, `` our only hidden wealth.'' Several criminal and civil lawsuits filed by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> opponents in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accuse the ousted leader of plundering billions of dollars from his country during his 20-year rule, and stashing it in hard-to-trace assets. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has suffered from an ailment and was hospitalized with chest pains several months ago, but a spokesman says he is now feeling fine, and was cheered by one early birthday gift: a $ 150,000, armor-plated, bullet-proof <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benz </ORGANIZATION> 450 SEL delivered for his use by some mainland friends. The Marcoses traveled to the party, however, in a brown station wagon.

 Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> swept toward <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> on Sunday with 100 mph winds and officials issued warnings to residents on the southern coasts of the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The storm ripped the roofs off houses and caused coastal flooding in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> all domestic flights and flights to and from <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> were canceled. Heavy rain and winds lashed the southern zone of the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> Sunday night as the hurricane passed south of the <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON> peninsula, officials reported. <PERSON> Eugenio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabral </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Dominican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, said there was some flooding in parts of the capital of <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Domingo </LOCATION> and power outages there and other southern areas but no casualties had been reported. Jamaican Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> alerted all government agencies and told a news conference Sunday night: `` Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> appears to be a real threat and everyone should follow the instructions and hurricane precautions issued by the Office of Disaster Preparedness in order to minimize the danger.'' <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said if the hurricane continues on its current course effects of the storm would be felt in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> by 6 a.m. EDT Monday. Ferry service across <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> was suspended and commercial flights were canceled. Outgoing flights from <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s international airports at <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> were being rescheduled but incoming flights continued to arrive Sunday, officials reported. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latina </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported a state of alert was declared at midday in the western Cuban provinces of <LOCATION> Guantanamo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Holguin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Granma </ORGANIZATION>. In the report from <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> received in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Prensa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Latina </LOCATION> said civil defense officials were broadcasting bulletins on national radio and television recommending emergency measures and providing information on the storm. Forecasters said the hurricane was gaining strength as it passed over the ocean and would dump heavy rain on the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> as it moved south of <LOCATION> Hispaniola </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island they share, and headed west. `` It's certainly one of the larger systems we've seen in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> for a long time,'' said <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerrish </PERSON>, forecaster at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> said that at 9 p.m. the hurricane's center was near 16.8 north latitude and and 72.2 west longitude or about 310 miles east of <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>, It said the storm was moving just north of due west at 15 mph and it was expected to continue that motion for the the next 24 hours. Maximum sustained winds were near 100 mph, the report said, with tropical-storm force winds extending up to 250 miles to the north and 100 miles to the south. The hurricane center said small craft in the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> should remain in port until winds and seas subside. Forecasters said the hurricane's track would take it about 50 miles south of southwestern <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. `` The track looks like it will go right over <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, but we ca n't say for certain yet,'' <PERSON> Gerrish </PERSON> said. The forecasters said the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> would receive 5 to 10 inches of rain on Sunday, with similar amounts falling in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> Sunday night and Monday. In <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Domingo </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> alerted the nation's heavily populated southern coast to prepare for high winds, heavy rains and high seas. Civil Defense Director <PERSON> Eugenio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabral </PERSON> said residents of the <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON> peninsula should closely follow <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s movement. An estimated 100,000 people live in the area, including 70,000 in the city of <LOCATION> Barahona </LOCATION>, 125 miles west of <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Domingo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cocco </PERSON> <PERSON> Quezada </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Dominican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said that if the hurricane changes course and starts moving north it would put the south in `` grave danger.'' Hurricane warnings also were issued for the south coast of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> by their respective governments. <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> said that hospitals throughout the island were discharging all patients who could leave on their own and only keeping the critically ill. The hospitals also were stocking up on emergency supplies of medicine, blankets, water and food. Tropical Storm <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> formed in the eastern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and strengthened into a hurricane Saturday night. `` The hurricane passed about 100 miles south of the southwest coast of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>'' on Saturday night, <PERSON> Gerrish </PERSON> said. `` They got pretty heavy rain.'' In <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, the storm left several homes without roofs, caused coastal flooding and downed power lines and trees along roads and highways in the west and southwestern regions. Four policemen stationed on <LOCATION> Mona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, between <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, were stranded as a result of the poor weather conditions. `` We are in constant contact with them by radio and they are in good condition,'' said a police official in <LOCATION> Mayaguez </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. Three people were injured in <LOCATION> Guayanilla </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, when a tree fell on top of their vehicle as they traveled along Route 97 shortly after midnight Saturday, police reported.

 <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s recent choice as deputy chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, resigned Sunday on the heels of a report that he compiled figures on the number of Jews in the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> under orders from then-President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> announced his resignation in a statement in which he did not deny compiling the figures, but did deny he was responsible for the demotion of any officials in the department. He said he did n't want the campaign to be distracted by the controversy <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> had acknowledged to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that he had compiled the figures. <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> had been picked by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to manage the Republican National Convention in August. He later moved to the deputy chair's slot with day-to-day responsibility for the party's fall campaign. His resignation was effective immediately. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> issued a simultaneous statement, saying, `` <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> made this decision to step aside because he did not want this campaign to be caught up in allegations about something that happened many years ago and that some might try to use against me.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday that former President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> had ordered <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> in 1971 to investigate what was described in notes as a `` Jewish cabal'' at the agency. At the time, <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> was <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s White House personnel chief and had been assigned to evaluate the <ORGANIZATION> BLS </ORGANIZATION> staff because <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> thought the bureau was interpreting unemployment data in an unfavorable light. On July 27, 1971, <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> reported to H.R. `` Bob'' <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s chief of staff, that 13 of 35 top <ORGANIZATION> BLS </ORGANIZATION> officials were Jewish. Post reporters found the memo last week in the archives of <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s presidency.

 More than 100,000 students in six states were expected to have classes disrupted Monday by strikes involving more than 6,100 teachers in 23 districts. In <LOCATION> Peabody </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, school officials and representatives of 400 striking teachers were back at the bargaining table Sunday trying to keep public school classes from being canceled a fourth day. The state <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has outlawed the strike, and school officials have mailed letters threatening to fire the teachers after a hearing procedure, said Mayor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Torigan </PERSON>. A spokeswoman for the teachers dismissed the notices as a pressure tactic and said the strike would continue. Pay is at the heart of the Peabody dispute, and many of the others in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Peabody </LOCATION>, teachers are seeking a three-year contract with a 9 percent pay increase each year. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitmore </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>, said the town proposed a 5.5 percent increase for each of the next three years. The Peabody strike affects about 5,700 students. A strike in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>' <LOCATION> Granite </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> district is disrupting classes for about 8,200 students. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> each have strikes in 9 districts, involving more than 40,000 students in each state.

<HEAD>Ceremony To Mark 30th Anniversary of Integrated Circuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> will help dedicate a state historical marker Monday to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the first working integrated circuit, which started an electronics revolution and changed the face of science. The anniversary comes as <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> itself is in the midst of a broad attempt to become the nation's center for computer chip manufacturing and development. Integrated circuits, which have come to be known as computer chips and are the brains behind everything from microcomputers to musical greeting cards, first were demonstrated on Sept. 12, 1958 in a laboratory at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. The historic marker, to be unveiled in a 9 a.m. CDT ceremony, honors <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clair </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilby </PERSON>, who first demonstrated his idea that basic building blocks of elecronics _ capacitors, transistors and resistors _ could be built out of a single semiconductive material. The discovery helped eliminate the expense and time needed to hand-solder electronic circuits. <PERSON> Kilby </PERSON>, who will attend Monday's ceremony, constructed a crude working model from a material called germanium. He later helped invent a hand-held calculator developed to show the commercial potential of the integrated circuit. <PERSON> Kilby </PERSON>'s first integrated circuit had nine components in a space one-sixteenth of an inch wide by seven-sixteenths of an inch long. Now, 180 billion integrated circuits later, more than 700,000 components can be crammed onto a chip. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> itself is hitching its economic hopes to computer chip development and manufacturing. TI announced last Thursday that it would spend $ 30 million in the next six months to a year developing a prototype production line at its <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> headquarters for future-generation RISC chips. Four other top chipmakers plan to help <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> become a world center of chip development. Within about an hour's drive of each other in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cypress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Micro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Devices </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> all are developing RISC chips. Each has established or will establish major research, design and development facilities in the area. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Ensley </PERSON>, vice president of four-year-old Austin-based <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' gains in chipmaking are proof the semiconductor industry is shifting its focus from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> `` There's no question that by the mid-1990s, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> will be the dominant center of gravity of the semiconductor industry in this country,'' <PERSON> Ensley </PERSON> said. In volume of chip production and number of wafer factories, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is second only to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and far ahead of any other state, according to <ORGANIZATION> In-Stat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a semiconductor industry statistical source in <LOCATION> Scottsdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>. The volume and variety of chips being made surpasses the days two decades ago when the semiconductor industry in the state could be described in two words: <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION>. TI now makes everything from the most basic `` glue logic'' chips to the most advanced 1 million-bit dynamic random access memory _ or DRAM _ chips at its 21 silicon wafer factories in <LOCATION> Sherman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>. Glue logic chips are devices that hold electronic circuits together and permit memory chips and microprocessors to communicate. Semiconductors now account for 46 percent of TI's sales and once again are setting records in unit and dollar volume In <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s leading semiconductor company, <ORGANIZATION> SGS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microelectronics </ORGANIZATION>, has resurrected what used to be known as <ORGANIZATION> Mostek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and is running its plant there six days a week. In <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> is set to begin producing DRAM chips. Silicon Valley-based companies are found all over: <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cypress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Micro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Devices </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> VLSI </ORGANIZATION> Technology in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>GM Ends Move Toward `Outsourcing' of Parts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Auto analysts say <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is using fewer outside parts suppliers while keeping more of its $ 40 billion annual parts production within the company. Improved union-management relations and the strong hand of <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stempel </PERSON> are behind the shift away from `` outsourcing,'' long a target of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union criticism. `` In every single plant, labor and management are sitting down together and reviewing problems and putting programs in place,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ephlin </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> vice president and head of the union's <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> department. `` That never happened before.'' <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> continues making more of its own parts than do <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The No. 1 automaker was producing 72 percent of its own parts as recently as May, compared with 54 percent at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and 39 percent at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>'s Office for the Study of <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> A year earlier, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> was planning to reduce internal parts production to 50 percent by 1992, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, director of the university office. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s apparent reversal has drawn new criticism from some of the outside parts makers it once relied upon. Smaller suppliers will go out of business and larger ones will shift their work toward <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, said the chief executive of one major supplier, who asked that his name not be used. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s components division, which employs 200,000 workers, denied the automaker deliberately had brought more parts production back within the <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> fold. `` The components group is fighting for every piece of business it can get,'' <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> said. `` We're fighting for it within <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and outside <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Stempel </PERSON>, however, made his position on the issue clear last year during his first news conference as president, saying, `` My objective is to get competitive, not to outsource and close.'' Under <PERSON> Stempel </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has looked beyond the immediate bottom line of the cost of parts, said <PERSON> Maryanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>, a New York-based industry analyst. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> officials earlier `` accepted this simplistic rationalization that went, ` We're paying $ 28 an hour for labor, and outside companies are paying $ 8 an hour, so no wonder we're not cost competitive,''' she said. `` Now they have a broader view of the cost equation _ that a lot of the problems result from bad organization and bad management philosophy,'' <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> said. `` That means they have it within their own power to cure the problems and, in many cases, without spending a lot of money.'' Top <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> officials were unavailable for comment. But a <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> member who spoke on condition of anonymity said Chairman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> expressed his support for <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s new approach at a meeting two weeks ago with union officials. `` A lot of what -LRB- <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> -RRB- talked about was family, about the fact that workers are family and suppliers are not, and that from now on, family is going to be taken care of first,'' the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> member said.
