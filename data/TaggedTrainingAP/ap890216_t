<HEAD>Cambodia Resistance Accuses Government of Intransigence in Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Cambodian guerrilla leaders met Thursday with senior officials in the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government and charged the officials with merely engaging in a public relations exercise in entering peace talks. The Cambodian officials and the three factions of the resistance coalition held a 45-minute session apart from their larger meeting with other Southeast Asian countries. The Cambodian officials `` maintained the same rigid attitude which is not conducive to a comprehensive settlement of the Kampuchean -LRB- <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> -RRB- problem,'' the coalition said in a statement. `` The plan proposed by the other side is tantamount to asking the -LRB- resistance -RRB- to capitulate to a regime installed by foreign forces,'' the statement said, adding that the government was only engaging in a public relations exercise. The meeting is aimed at ending the war that began after Soviet-armed <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978. Vietnamese forces since have battled the guerrillas backed by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The guerrilla leaders said a solution was possible only on the basis of a plan proposed by resistance leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>. <PERSON> Phnom </PERSON> <PERSON> Penh </PERSON> rejected that plan even before the talks began. Resistance spokesman <PERSON> Thiounn </PERSON> <PERSON> Prasith </PERSON> read the statement aloud at a news conference after a 10-minute monologue in which he railed against <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and the `` illegal'' Cambodian regime it was `` manipulating.'' He denounced <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> for not allowing international supervision of its troop withdrawal and claimed that about 20,000 Vietnamese soldiers recently have disguised themselves in Cambodian uniforms. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in January said it will end its 10-year military incursion in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by the end of September. <PERSON> Phnom </PERSON> <PERSON> Penh </PERSON>'s representative, <PERSON> Hor </PERSON> <PERSON> Nam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hong </PERSON>, appeared at the same news conference, insisting his side fervently desires a settlement. The organizer of the talks, <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Alatas </PERSON>, said that at the plenary session, the officials discussed the Vietnamese withdrawal, an end to foreign military aid to the guerrillas, and a mechanism for supervision and control of any agreement. The session brought together <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, its ally <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government, the resistance, and the members of <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION>: <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>. A first round of talks, held in July, achieved no breakthroughs but resulted in a consensus that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s withdrawal must be linked to measures preventing the return to power of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, which killed hundreds of thousands of people in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> before <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> toppled it. The communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> is allied in the guerrilla coalition with the forces of <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> and Son <PERSON> Sann </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, widely seen as the central figure in any future Cambodian government, is boycotting the talks because <PERSON> Phnom </PERSON> <PERSON> Penh </PERSON> rejected his peace plan. The plan included calls for dissolution of the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government before a general election; introduction of an international peace-keeping force to guarantee any settlement; and specifics from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on its pledge to withdraw its troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Military Production at Arms Plant To Be Cut by Half</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government says <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s largest armarments plant will halve its military production this year and increase its turnout of heavy equipment for civilian use. The official <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> news agency said Wednesday that the cuts are linked to recent disarmament initiatives by <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc countries that follow <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s lead in announcing cuts in military manpower and spending. While halving its military production, the plant at <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> in western <LOCATION> Slovakia </LOCATION> will make more equipment for civilian use, such as construction and road-building machinery, <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> quoted company director <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Uhrik </PERSON> as saying. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> last month announced it would cut defense spending by 15 percent and trim its armed forces by 12,000 men in the next two years. The cuts are also to include the scrapping of tanks and other hardware. According to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> figures, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> has about 145,000 troops. In December, Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s said 50,000 <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops would be withdrawn from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> by the end of 1990. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> have also announced troop cuts. While the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact cuts seem designed to boost new East-West talks next month in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> on reducing conventional arms and forces across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, they also benefit the East's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> governments by freeing up funds for sorely needed economic reforms.

<HEAD>Arab, Jew Promote Coexistence With Music</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Two Israeli musicians, an Arab and a Jew, have formed a duo to promote Arab-Jewish coexistence through music. The twosome, called `` The White Bird,'' features <PERSON> Taisir </PERSON> <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> on violin and oud, a lute-like stringed instrument of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Migel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartstein </PERSON> on guitar and banjo. <PERSON> Elias </PERSON>, an Israeli Arab from the northern town of <LOCATION> Shfaram </LOCATION>, said he met <PERSON> Hartstein </PERSON>, a Jewish farmer, at the annual <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> Festival last year and `` saw that we have to work together, to maintain this coexistence, this musical dialogue.'' Since then, the two have performed in front of small audiences in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>, and has twice traveled to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. In March, the musicians plan another tour abroad. <PERSON> Hartstein </PERSON> is a farmer from the <PERSON> Ganot </PERSON> agricultural cooperative near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> teaches at the Jerusalem Academy of Music. Their music is a gentle blend of Eastern tones and Western popular music, with some motifs derived from American country music. `` It is human music, universal music,'' says <PERSON> Elias </PERSON>. `` It is a mid-way meeting between Eastern and Western music. From there, we start to create a special musical language.'' But, according to <PERSON> Elias </PERSON>, there is a political message too: `` The moment a Jew and an Arab play together and create together, they can not hate each other. That's the ideal we strive for.''

<HEAD>Oil Found That May Have Anointed Kings Of Israel</HEAD>

 Near the site where the Dead Sea scrolls were found, archaeologists have dug up a 2,000-year-old flask filled with an oil that might have been used to anoint the ancient Israelite kings. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrich </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> unveiled the flask Wednesday and said the oil, which has a honey-like consistency, may be the only surviving sample of the balsam oil used as an aromatic body cream or perfume. `` After conducting extensive laboratory analysis and checking literary sources, there is a good possibility that what we have here is the fragrant balsam oil that was famous throughout the Roman Empire,'' he said. The oil matches a discription of a perfume mentioned by the Roman historian <PERSON> Pliny </PERSON>. Known as persimmon oil, it was distilled from a bush-like plant now believed to be extinct. The ancient perfume was very expensive _ a sort of Chanel No. 5 of its day _ and was coveted throughout the Roman Empire. The persimmon plant, which was different from the modern tree of the same name, grew only in the Dead Sea oasis of En <PERSON> Gedi </PERSON> and around <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION>. The ancient Israelites guarded the secret formula for making the oil, going so far as to post warnings against anyone revealing the process. When the Roman legions approached, the Israelites tried to destroy the orchard of plants. <PERSON> Pliny </PERSON>'s writings indicate the <ORGANIZATION> Romans </ORGANIZATION> took over production, archaeologists say. <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> chemist <PERSON> Zeev </PERSON> <PERSON> Aizenshtat </PERSON>, who spent three months analyzing the substance, said whatever fragrance the oil had evaporated in the desert cave, where summer temperatures hover over 104 degrees. He said he was unable to make an absolute identification because there were no surviving samples of the ancient plant to make a comparison. `` This oil is very different from other ancient oils in that it did not deteriorate,'' <PERSON> Aizenshtat </PERSON> said. `` This may be the oldest oil that contains such organic matter and whose properties have not been greatly altered by chemical reactions over time.'' The clay juglet stands 5 inches high and contains about 1 -LCB- to 3 -LCB- ounces of the reddish oil, which is well-preserved and dates to the 1st century B.C. It was wrapped in palm leaves and carefully concealed. It was found last year by the expedition, which includes an American team of volunteers from the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judaic-Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The flask was buried in a 3-foot-deep pit in the honeycomb of caves at <LOCATION> Qumran </LOCATION>, 50 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and the site where the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered in 1947. The scrolls, ancient holy writings including the Book of <LOCATION> Isaiah </LOCATION>, were hidden by the Essene Sect in the 1st century A.D. to avoid plundering by the advancing Romans. The expedition will resume digging soon as part of a 6-year-old project to explore the thousands of caves in <LOCATION> Qumran </LOCATION> overlooking the <LOCATION> Dead </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Boorstein </PERSON>, a scholar at the Mercaz HaRav Yeshiva in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said the oil was one of 11 holy fragrances burned as incense on the altar of ancient Jewish Temple. It is mentioned in Exodus and in the collection of Jewish law and commentary called the Talmud. <PERSON> Boorstein </PERSON> said the Talmud describes the oil as highly inflammable and tells the story of a woman killing her daughter by convincing her she should light a candle after rubbing her body with the oil to make its perfume effect stronger. The balsam oil, described by some ancient rabbis as more valuable than gold, was used to annoint the kings of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> after <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> in the 10th Century B.C.E. `` During the ceremony, it would be poured across the king's head in the form of an X,'' <PERSON> Boorstein </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Woman Fails to Lose Weight; Must Pay A Hefty Fine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A woman who was told she could either lose 100 pounds or pay a $ 500 fine as part of her sentence in a marijuana conviction failed to drop the weight and must now put up the dough, a judge said. <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Usinger </PERSON>, 29, was convicted last year of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> told her he'd knock $ 5 off the $ 500 fine for every pound she lost before she next returned to court. The unusual sentence had been recommended by her former probation agent, who reasoned that with a better self-image, Ms. <PERSON> Usinger </PERSON> would be less likely to turn to criminal activity. If she lost 100 pounds, she would n't have to pay a fine. But on Tuesday, Ms. <PERSON> Usinger </PERSON> weighed 265 pounds, the same as she did when <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> first fined her. At the sentencing, <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> stayed a two-year prison term for Ms. <PERSON> Usinger </PERSON>. He said he was satisfied that she had met other conditions of probation, including 100 hours of community service work and participation in a drug program. The weight reduction incentive, <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said, was an option, not a condition of probation. `` If she'd rather pay the fine, that's her choice,'' he said.

<HEAD>Anger Runs Deep In Moslem Community; Vengeance Does Not</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The anger over <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> and his novel `` The Satanic Verses'' is quick to flare and shared by many in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s Moslem community, from the sweetmeats shopkeeper to the Bangladeshi banker But while they spare no insult for the author they accuse of blasphemy, many in the city's narrow East End streets do n't seek vengeance and reject <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s order to execute him. The Imams and Mosque council in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> issued an appeal to `` all imams'' _ Moslem clergymen _ to respect British law. An information office representing Prince <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>, son of the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, said the Iranian government's reaction exemplifies the `` brutal and arbitrary intolerance that is rampant in <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>.'' The statement, however, said the prince was sympathetic to objections to the book. In conversations with immigrants in the East End's <LOCATION> Brick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lane </LOCATION> shops, some cheered the death call. But many said the author, who has canceled a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour and dropped from sight, should live. `` To kill him is not going to solve the problem,'' said <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheikh </PERSON>, the owner of a shop selling leather goods who called for a law that would prevent such books from being written again. `` There must be some way that governments can approve a resolution that in future no writer should have a right to write against any prophet _ <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> or <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>,'' he said. Moslems revere <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> as the prophet who brought <PERSON> Allah </PERSON>'s revelations to mankind in the Koran, the holy book of Islam `` But do I personally agree with the ayatollah? It does n't matter,'' said Sheikh, one of the many Moslem Bangladeshis living in the <LOCATION> Brick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lane </LOCATION> area `` You ca n't stop the ayatollah. You ca n't stop the people who will do the job ... Anyone who kills <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> will become a hero in the Islamic world.'' Like Sheikh, most Moslems acknowledged they have n't read the book. Most learned about it at one of the five mosques located in a one-square-mile area of this district, from leaflets, or from television reports. `` He insulted our prophet, our religion. From TV we know this,'' said a shopkeeper selling sticky sweets who refused to give his name. Even though they have n't read the book, they are sure it insults their prophet and are quick to say so when the novel is mentioned. `` Our older people read it, they say it's wrong, so we believe them,'' <PERSON> Nassim </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, a Pakistani Moslem, said as he ate lunch at a modest tandoori restaurant. `` They've been studying for years and years and they should know.'' <PERSON> Maqbool </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali-Kassam </PERSON>, waiting for his takeout tea, boomed from across the room: `` Anyone who denies the religion of Islam shall be killed.'' <PERSON> Ali-Kassam </PERSON>, a taxi cab radio controller who calls himself a follower of the ayatollah, said he believes <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> deliberately meant to insult Islam. Dozens of drivers from his company stayed at the office until early Wednesday morning, he said, arguing about the book and the execution order. `` Some said he did n't mean anything about <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>, others wanted him killed.'' Many Moslems believe <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, 41, insults <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> by portraying him as a character called Mahound, a prophet of a city called <PERSON> Jahilia </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mahound </PERSON> was a medieval corruption of the word <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>. They are especially angered by one sequence in which prostitutes are given the names of some of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s nine wives and by the book's implication that <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, not <PERSON> Allah </PERSON>, may have been the real author of the Koran. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> was born into a Moslem family in <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, and educated in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>. He lives in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. His novel has sold more than 100,000 copies since it was published in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in September to critical acclaim. `` Previously <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> has been criticized, but not in this naked way,'' said <PERSON> Abul </PERSON> <PERSON> Khair </PERSON>, a top officer at the <ORGANIZATION> Sonali </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>'s state bank, on <LOCATION> Brick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lane </LOCATION>. `` It is intolerable for Moslems.'' But he does n't agree with the ayatollah. `` We do n't want violence. Islam is a peaceful religion,'' he said. Restaurant manager <PERSON> Asaad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramjaun </PERSON>, a Mauritian immigrant, said of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>: `` I think he's the devil himself.'' `` We understand this is a free society, but I think this is freedom of abuse,'' he said. `` But since this is a free society _ he should n't be killed. He should be given a chance.''

<HEAD>Paper Admits Soviets Badly Underestimated Cherobyl Health Effects</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Authorities badly underestimated the health problems the 1986 <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear disaster would cause, with reported cancer cases doubling in a region near the stricken plant that was not evacuated, <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported. The article Wednesday in the weekly newspaper said calves are born routinely without heads and limbs in the radiation-contaminated area of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>. It said more than half the children of the <LOCATION> Narodichsky </LOCATION> region _ an agriculturally rich area within 30 miles of the plant _ have thyroid gland illnesses, which can be caused by exposure to radiation. The newspaper's correspondent, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolinko </PERSON>, said one woman, who cares for pigs at a tainted farm, asked, `` My daughter recently got married. What kind of grandson will I have?'' In all, 31 people died in the immediate aftermath of the explosion and fire at the plant on April 26, 1986. The disaster sent a cloud of radiation around the world. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News reported that elevated levels of radioactive cesium-137 were detected among many residents of the Narodichsky region, which was not evacuated after the accident. It said, `` Health officials of the republic insist there is no health danger for people outside a 19-mile zone around the atomic power station.'' Since the accident, Soviet officials stressed time and again that radiation levels were safe in all but the immediate area surrounding the plant. They generally discounted warnings from some Western doctors that cases of cancer and other diseases would soar. The Moscow News article, however, was the second this month in the Soviet press to suggest health problems from the accident were mounting. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported Feb. 9 that cancer and other diseases are on the rise in <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION>, the republic neighboring the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> that also was contaminated by <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said authorities had just determined that one-fifth of <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION> is contaminated. <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said lip, mouth and other cancers doubled among Narodichsky region residents since the accident. <PERSON> Kolinko </PERSON> said residents had a right to be outraged. He wrote that if the government is serious about its pledges, residents `` would have the right to demand _ to demand and not ask _ for full compensation ... not to mention the right to full information about people's health and the condition of the land.'' At the <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> animal farm, the newspaper said, veterinarian <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kudin </PERSON> reported that during the five years before Chernobyl, three cases of birth defects occurred among pigs and there were no abnormal calves. In the year after the disaster, 37 pigs and 27 calves had birth defects, he said. In the first nine months of 1988, 41 pigs and 35 calves were born with abnormalities _ `` the calves frequently without heads, limbs, eyes or ribs, the pigs goggle-eyed or with deformed skulls.'' The animals had been feeding on fields where wind had blown radioactive particles, the newspaper said. It said that uncontaminated meat and dairy products are brought in for residents, but some people ignore doctors' warnings and drink milk from local cows and pick fruit and vegetables from their garden plots.

 The owner and editor of the popular and award-winning newspaper <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> Color began planning its first edition in nearly five years as soon as he heard Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> had been ousted. `` We're going to come out with the same kinds of stories that prompted them to shut us down before _ corruption, narcotics trafficking, and the violation of human rights,'' said <PERSON> Aldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuccolillo </PERSON>. Warming to the subject, the 59-year-old journalist added, `` We want to become permanent reminders to Gen. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> of the promises he made when he assumed power.'' Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> toppled <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> on Feb. 3 and almost immediately gave Zuccolillo permission to resume publishing <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> Color as he promised to respect freedom of the press and human rights. The newspaper, best known for its investigative stories, was once the most widely read daily in this <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> capital of 900,000 people. `` I am certain that Gen. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> will not ask me nor anyone to refrain from publishing an article because he does n't like it, `` said <PERSON> Zuccolillo </PERSON>, who founded <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> Color in 1967. Zuccolillo frequently clashed with <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> and his aides, enduring threats, arrests and, finally, closure of the 80,000-circulation paper by plainclothes police in March 1984. The stated reason: the paper was provoking class hatred among Paraguayans. In preceding years, seven <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> Color journalists were arrested, and one expelled. Zuccolillo himself was jailed twice, the first time for 11 days, the second for a week. He says he's sure that wo n't happen again: `` Now, we'll no longer have the overnight bags that we kept behind the doors in the newsroom in case the police came and took us directly to jail.'' The new issue, to hit the street in about a month, will differ little from editions in the past that won citations from, among other, the <ORGANIZATION> InterAmerican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. Three years ago, <PERSON> Zuccolillo </PERSON> was awarded the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize from <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s journalism school. `` We're going to investigate everything. We have the staff and the sources of information,'' <PERSON> Zuccolillo </PERSON> said. `` Now you're going to begin to see news sources appear that in other times would hide because they were scared to death.'' In the days following the coup, <PERSON> Zuccolillo </PERSON> saw a constant stream of foreign reporters who tried to get a better handle on Paraguayan politics from a veteran observer. `` I think Gen. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> has no other option than to fulfill his promises,'' said <PERSON> Zuccolillo </PERSON>. `` The Paraguayan people are totally fed up with <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> and Streossnerism.'' <PERSON> Zuccolillo </PERSON> said hard work and skill, not luck, had kept <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> in power for nearly 35 years. `` <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> had a great Machiavellian political talent to achieve his objectives,'' Zuccolillo said. `` He was a planner, he was very intelligent, he had a great power of synthesis and an extraordinary memory, but he also was immoral, unscrupulous, bloodthirsty and a corrupter.'' Zuccolillo, who broke with Paraguayan tradition by forbidding his journalists to accept government payoffs, plans to trace just how corrupt his former nemesis was. `` The first clues are going to come from outside, from <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` I already have a couple of <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> journalists who are willing to help me, and I'm going to send a couple of reporters from here ... when I get some money together.'' Investigative reports published by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> Color in the past alleged that by overcharging gasoline sold by the private oil company <ORGANIZATION> Refineria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paraguaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> bilked the country of about $ 800 million over five years in the 1970s. `` <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> might barely have a $ 10,000 bungalow -LRB- in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> -RRB-, but he has well over a billion dollars overseas,'' claimed Zuccolillo. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> was exiled to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, where he is said to own a home. Zuccolillo dismisses the reservations some have that the <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> government may become the equivalent of `` Stroessnerism without <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>.'' `` You ca n't have Stroessnerism without <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> if you have a free press,'' he said. `` A free press is the antidote of the people against totalitarianism.''

 A former mental patient described as a `` disgruntled employee'' shot three women co-workers to death and killed himself at the office of a savings and loan association Wednesday, police said. The gunman was identified as <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON>, 33, of Silver Spring, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, police said. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> had been released about a year ago after five years at the <ORGANIZATION> Clifton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Perkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jessup </LOCATION>, Md. <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> was sent to the mental hospital after he was ruled criminally insane following his arrest on charges of assaulting a police officer. Two victims have also been identified by police as <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Landover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Tanya </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Md. The names of the other victims were were not immediately released. Police in this <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, suburb said the three people killed in addition to <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> were all female employees at <ORGANIZATION> Chevy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> also wounded <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 22, of Silver Spring, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, police said. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who was shot in the jaw, is in critical condition at <LOCATION> Suburban </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> following surgery. According to <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police spokesman Officer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludington </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> got off an elevator at the credit card department of the S & amp; L at the end of the lunch hour, walked down a hallway and through a set of double doors, and shot <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and one of the women. The Ethiopian native then went into a nearby lunchroom and killed the other two women, <PERSON> Luddington </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> then turned his .38 - caliber revolver on himself, <PERSON> Ludington </PERSON> `` It happened very quickly,'' <PERSON> Ludington </PERSON> said. He described the gunman as a `` disgruntled employee.'' A fellow worker said the man was a collector in the credit card department. `` All of the people that I have talked to about it are very disturbed, very surprised by it ... because all indications were that Mr. <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> was doing very well,'' <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Golden </PERSON>, spokesman for the state health department, told <ORGANIZATION> WUSA-TV </ORGANIZATION>. The station said <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> had originally been arrested after approaching a <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police officer and saying, `` I want to die, kill me,'' and then reaching for the officer's gun. He was charged with attempted murder in that case, according to the television report. A <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police official said late Wednesday they would not release any details about <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON>'s background. Another employee, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Abellano </PERSON> said he was sitting next to <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> when <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> came into the office. `` First he shot <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> and then I went under my chair,'' he said. <PERSON> Abellano </PERSON>, who was not injured, said <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> had had an argument with a co-worker earlier in the day. He said that person was not injured. <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapin </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, who was on the telephone with an employee of the S & amp; L when the shootings occurred, said he heard screaming in the background. `` I hear a banging at the door and ... I heard somebody say, ` Do n't let him in, don ` t let him in,' <PERSON> Chapin </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` And then ... I hear another scream and I hear another shot. ... `` Out of horror, I'm sitting here listening to the phone,'cause I do n't know if it's a hostage situation going on or what. And I waited and waited and waited until I heard the police sirens, so I figure somebody's on the scene at that point. Then I heard somebody say something, ` Why do n't they come up here?' and that's when I heard some more shooting and then the phone went dead,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bank Board Member Fails to Keep Stock-Sale Pledge</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A member of the board that regulates the savings and loan industry has not sold his stock in a family business despite a sworn pledge to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and a legal requirement that he do so. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> learned that <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> continues to hold a 29 percent share in <ORGANIZATION> Pope </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Menomonee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, company that makes laboratory glassware. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> has valued his share of the company at $ 100,000 to $ 250,000. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, and other employees of the agency blame a paperwork jam and confusing rules for his failure to sell his stock or be relieved of his promise. The bank board oversees the operation of more than 3,000 savings and loan institutions, regulating their transactions and auditing their records. `` I'm still waiting for an opinion from the ethics people,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` Basically, I did n't want to get rid of it because you ca n't get rid of it,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said of his stake in the company. `` It is a very, very small company and it's all family held.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>, holds a 51 percent interest in the company and is its president. Her stake in the company is valued at more than $ 250,000, according to <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s financial disclosure forms. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> had been chairman of the company from 1983 until he became a member of the bank board. Although the company does occasional work for the government, its business would have little or no occasion for contact with the bank board. But <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> was advised to divest himself of the holding because his stake in the company was so large that under bank board rules, <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> Scientific </PERSON> would be considered his `` alter ego,'' according to a letter from <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quillian </PERSON>, the board's general counsel and ethics officer. `` This relationship would, therefore, have a substantial effect on <PERSON> Pope </PERSON>'s ability to do business,'' <PERSON> Quillian </PERSON> wrote in a letter attached to <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s 1987 financial disclosure form. `` Mr. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> has indicated that he will transfer his interest in <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> to his wife or other relative to avoid any conflict or appearance of conflict from his ownership interest in <PERSON> Pope </PERSON>.'' In sworn testimony during his confirmation hearings before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in 1987, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> was asked whether he pledged to abide by the ethics finding. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> responded, `` Yes.'' <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON> said he knew nothing about <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s holding in Pope Scientific or his promise to dispose of it, but a blanket pledge such as the one <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> gave the committee is more than ceremonial. `` Generically, the committee understands all standard statements required by people who testify to be very serious,'' <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON> said. `` The committee would n't ask for it unless they thought it was serious, and they expect to be told the truth.'' Under federal ethics laws, the property should have been disposed of within 90 days of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s confirmation by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in August 1987, with notice given to both the Office of Government Ethics and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said Wednesday that he had sold off his other holdings as promised when he became a member of the board but did not dispose of his Pope Scientific stock because he was waiting for an opinion from the staff. `` I got rid of everything else. ... I liquidated everything I owned at a substantial cost,'' he said. Both <PERSON> Quillian </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurtenbach </PERSON>, another agency ethics officer, were in the room with <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> when he was interviewed by telephone, and both said the initial opinion that <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> should sell the stock was wrong. `` There was never any question of impropriety or any conflict of interest,'' <PERSON> Quillian </PERSON> said. `` It was an extremely technical question of the status of the company under the board's regulations. `` We think that in the first instance the interpretation went too far. We bent over backward, as did Mr. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, and on reflection we believe that we were too technical and too strict.'' Nevertheless, neither the ethics office nor the banking committee has been informed of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s intention to keep his share of the company. <PERSON> Kurtenbach </PERSON> said his office was to blame for failure to notify the ethics office and the banking committee. `` I think that was a part where we fell down,'' he said. `` It was just an administrative screw-up.'' The government ethics office, the watchdog agency for the executive branch, also has not received a copy of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s annual financial disclosure report, although one should have been handed over no later than last September, according to <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Zorn </PERSON>, who is assigned to monitor the bank board's ethics compliance. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s form, along with those of the other two members of the board, <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, are on file at the agency but have not been forwarded to the government ethics office. <PERSON> Kurtenbach </PERSON> said this was because the agency was behind in its paperwork. <PERSON> Zorn </PERSON> said in his discussions with the bank board, there were `` loose ends'' to be tied up with <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s finances, one of which was the Pope Scientific stock. The bank board staff was most concerned about <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s stock in <ORGANIZATION> MGIC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and his position as senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> sold the stock, resigned from <ORGANIZATION> MGIC </ORGANIZATION> and promised to take no part in board actions on matters that may come up dealing with <ORGANIZATION> MGIC </ORGANIZATION> or the mortgage insurance industry

 The four top candidates for the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s chief civil rights job all would sharply change the controversial policies that <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> followed for the last eight years. A leading candidate is <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a disabled-rights advocate who publicly battled <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> over a proposal to reduce anti-discrimination protection for handicapped people. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, is being considered for the post of assistant attorney general in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s civil rights division, said administration sources. Confined to a wheelchair, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> has been an advocate for handicapped Americans and once successfully sued the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> after being told his disability would bar his promotion to supervisor. Also under consideration are <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinzel </PERSON>, minority chief counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s permanent investigations subcommittee and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON>, former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> who has served as counsel to the Wednesday Group of moderate <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans. A former career <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employee, <PERSON> Rinzel </PERSON> once headed the criminal section of the civil rights division and set records for the number of cases brought. That performance won him a promotion under <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> to deputy assistant attorney general. Another candidate is <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, longtime career deputy assistant attorney general in the division who early in the civil rights movement prosecuted white supremacists and other rights violators in the deep South, sources said. `` Everyone on the list would turn it around,'' one of the candidates, who knows the others, said on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, an aide to Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, said `` we're looking for someone whose views reflect <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s and the president's views on the importance of the civil rights division.'' `` We're looking for somebody who can work with civil rights organizations,'' said <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>. The major civil rights organizations tangled regularly with <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> throughout the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> helped formulate and direct the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's policy of challenging affirmative action hiring quotas He also moved to overturn court-ordered busing programs and to restrict federal guarantees for women's rights and the rights of the mentally ill and disabled. Without committing himself on specific issues, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he wants civil rights policy to be sharply different from that followed under <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> reflected the new administration's stance by meeting with civil rights leaders, notably <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. After meeting with the attorney general last month, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and said, `` The lights have been turned back on in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> noted <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s `` interest in the civil rights area that goes back to the 1960s.'' `` He knows many of the civil rights leaders first hand,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. `` He is personally committed to making sure the laws are enforced.'' While <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> is still reviewing other applications, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> `` is certainly a leading candidate,'' said one source, who spoke Wednesday on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> confirmed in a telephone interview that he met with <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> this week and was told a decision would be made `` in a couple of weeks.'' The appointment, which will be made by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s recommendation, is subject to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said he had been told earlier by <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> that he was a leading candidate for the position and nothing that <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said during their meeting dispelled that impression. `` I just thought it was a good interview,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. Without directly criticizing <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to attract black voters was due in part to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's civil rights record `` I think it's very important for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to have a civil rights record they can run on and attract votes from groups covered by the civil rights laws.'' `` I've seen estimates as low as 9 percent of the black voters voted for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in 1988,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think that's good for black people to be taken for granted by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> or for this country.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who is confined to a wheelchair because of a paralyzing illness and subsequent injury, headed the <ORGANIZATION> Disability </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> when he battled <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> in 1982. At issue was a proposal by a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration task force on deregulation to weaken rules prohibiting companies and institutions that receive federal funds from discriminating against handicapped employees. `` It was very important to the disability rights movement that we retain the rules and regulations and <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> was very critical of me,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said, recalling the dispute. At one point, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> demanded <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>' resignation from the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The proposal to change 1977 regulations enforcing the anti-discrimination law was withdrawn by the administration.

<HEAD>Members of Senate Communications Panel Hold Stock in Industry</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Members of a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> communications panel held stock in the industry and acted on issues that could have affected their holdings, a practice that is forbidden in the executive branch but legal for lawmakers. Critics complain about the double standard on conflict-of-interest rules, but others say it would be impossible to apply the same standards to the executive and legislative branches. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> selected the communications subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to show examples of stock holdings and congressional action. Financial information for the 11 senators came from their disclosure forms for 1987, the most recent year available. Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, the committee's chairman and member of the subcommittee, had larger holdings in telecommunications than any other senator on the communications panel. On Aug. 21, 1987, he bought about $ 100,000 worth of stock in <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the day the company went public. In December, <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> helped postpone the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s plans to hold lotteries for licensing cellular telephones in rural areas, according to Sen. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, D-Wash. As committee chairman, <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> had to approve a Jan. 27, 1988, communications subcommittee hearing on the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed lottery idea <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION>, testified in opposition to portions of the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s plan. <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> said he did n't know he owned the stock because his broker bought it for him. `` As soon as it was brought to my attention that I owned it, I told him to get rid of it, which he did,'' <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> said through a spokesman. He said he first found out about his holdings in McCaw in February 1988, but it is unclear whether he made a profit or a loss on the stock. Some of the stock was sold in November 1987. In 1987, <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> also sold between $ 100,000 and $ 250,000 in stock and $ 2,000 and $ 10,000 in options in <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which in 1986 purchased the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. A communications subcommittee member, Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, said he had no qualms about his longtime interest in <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, which owns two television stations and two radio stations in his home state The holding is worth less than $ 5,000. `` It's not a substantial holding,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said. His votes include one against a bill extending the fairness doctrine, which required stations to air opposing views. <PERSON> Marla </PERSON> <PERSON> Romash </PERSON>, an aide to Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Tenn., said the senator is sensitive to conflict of interest issues but has n't felt the $ 1,540 in <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock owned by his wife, <PERSON> Tipper </PERSON>, to be an issue <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION>, which manufactures electronic goods including telephones, is the parent company of Radio Shack. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> voted for legislation to require all telephones to be equipped with devices so they are compatible with hearing aids. Sen. <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Ky., dismissed the notion there could be a conflict between his duties on the panel and the less than $ 5,000 worth of <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock his wife inherited `` The amount of stock does n't amount to a grain of sand on the beach,'' <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s spokesman said. One member of the full committee, Sen. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON>, R-Kan., said she avoided voting `` a couple of times'' on issues that dealt with communications because her family had interests in radio stations Mrs. <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> sold <ORGANIZATION> WREN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, for more than $ 250,000 in January 1987. Some other senators have their holdings in blind trusts, including Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., a member of the communications subcommittee, as a way of dealing with potential conflicts The basic federal conflict law makes it a crime for executive branch employees to take government action in which their immediate families have a financial interest, unless a waiver is obtained. The top penalty is two years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine. But no law or rule prevents members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from holding assets that might conflict with their official duties. So lawmakers can routinely craft or vote on legislation that could affect their financial interests. One argument for not applying the conflict law to them is that their assets are publicly disclosed so voters can decide for themselves if senators or representatives are acting for personal enrichment.

The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees government buying, said Wednesday that for a minimum of 60 days, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> will have to submit for review any computer purchase in excess of $ 2.5 million. Previously, <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> let the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> award computer contracts of up to $ 10 million. `` This action clearly shows the administrator's intent to increase <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION>'s oversight over <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> computer buys and to fully cooperate with our committee's investigation into alleged favoritism toward <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s systems,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Government Operations The panel, which has been investigating the way computer contracts are awarded, last week asked the government to restrict the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s authority. <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> cited government statistics indicating that <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> currently holds almost 55 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s large-scale computer base, compared with the company's 37 percent share government-wide. The committee had received a complaint last November from six <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> competitors that they have been frozen out of much of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s multibillion-dollar computer market The companies complained in a letter to former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> that <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> procurement officials had tailored the bid specifications so that only <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> could win although many of the companies offer `` clones'' or duplicates of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> systems at lower prices. The five-page letter was signed by executives of the <ORGANIZATION> Amdahl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Memorex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> VION </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> NCR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Compten </ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Storage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Wednesday the service would have no comment until it reviewed the <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> decision The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee also has asked the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, to investigate complaints that federal agencies are restricting their computer procurements to favor <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> was asked last week to supply to the committee within 60 days a broad evaluation of the extent that federal agencies restrict their procurements to <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> `` code-compatible'' systems. With expenditures of about $ 17.4 billion last year on computer, communications and data processing equipment and services, the government is the industry's largest single purchaser.

<HEAD>Nader Says Tax the Wealthy, Stock Sales to Finance Rescue</HEAD>

 The wealthy should pay more to resolve the savings and loan crisis, says consumer activist <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> in claiming the administration's rescue plan puts the burden on the poor and middle class. `` The people of this country -LRB- are -RRB- demanding that the government sock it to the rich and powerful who caused the savings and loan crime and who will benefit from its resolution,'' he said at a news conference Wednesday. Last week, the president proposed spending $ 200 billion over the next 30 years _ about half of it from general tax revenues _ to sell or close insolvent institutions. <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, in a 23-page `` Report to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Taxpayers on the Savings and Loan Crisis,'' said spending general tax revenue on <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls would squeeze vital government programs such as education and housing. But he also acknowledged that imposing a major share of the cleanup cost on healthy S & amp; Ls could drive some institutions toward insolvency. As an alternative, <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> offered four tax increase proposals, each of which would raise about $ 10 billion a year, enough to pay the interest on government borrowing to resolve the problem. They are: _ boosting the marginal income tax rate for the nation's wealthiest taxpayers _ childless couples with taxable income higher than $ 149,250 a year, for instance _ from 28 percent to 33 _ levying a 0.5 percent tax on stock sales, which totaled $ 2.3 trillion in 1987 <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> argued this would dampen speculation and encourage long-term investing. _ raising corporate taxes, estimated at $ 107 billion this year, by 10 percent _ a combination of higher deposit insurance premiums and new excise taxes on mutual funds, junk bonds, leveraged buyout deals and mortgages for luxury homes <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> said any increase in deposit insurance premiums paid by banks and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls should be accompanied by measures restricting institutions from passing on the higher cost to their smallest customers. `` Under the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan to bail out the crooked and speculative savings and loan institutions, the people who are working every day and paying their taxes are paying the bill,'' he said. `` Under our plan, the corporations, the banks and very upper income people ... would pay the bill.'' <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Nader </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> BankWatch </ORGANIZATION>, advocated restructuring the 12 regional <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION>, owned by the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L industry but created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the 1930s to borrow money from Wall Street investors at low government rates and pass on the money to S & amp; Ls. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the boards of the regional banks should be appointed by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, rather than elected by S & amp; Ls. He said S & amp; Ls should be required to lend part of the money advanced by the regional banks for low income housing and neighborhood redevelopment. `` This is a cash-generating machine which has been appropriated for private purposes and is not pursuing its public housing mandate,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group representing about 900 banks and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls, rejected the proposal as `` massive social engineering which will be so burdensome as to prevent the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L industry from ever recovering.'' The bankers said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan rescues depositors, not S & amp; L owners.

<HEAD>Long-Distance Rates Drop as Local Charges Rise</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plans to drop its rates for basic interstate long-distance service by an average 1.6 percent on April 1, for a total annual savings to customers of $ 533 million. A consumer advocate complained, however, that for the cuts such heavy-use periods as nights and weekends were insignificant. The rate cut, which is subject to approval by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, would be the eighth price reduction since <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> shed its local operating companies in 1984. Since that time, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T long-distance rates have dropped more than 39 percent, the company said Wednesday. The proposed rate reduction reflects lower costs for connecting to local telephone networks. Those costs will drop April 1 when the charge residential and small business customers pay to maintain local phone network _ the so-called subscriber line charge _ rises 30 cents per month to $ 3.50. With customers paying more of the costs to maintain the local network, long-distance companies have had to pay less. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> has required <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T, the largest long-distance company and the only one subject to federal rate regulation, to pass along these savings to customers by lowering rates. But while most long-distance rates would go down under the new proposal, prices for basic long-distance calls under 292 miles would increase an average of 4.7 percent _ a little less than a penny a minute. Such calls account for about one-third of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's interstate traffic. Also, daytime price cuts would be larger than evening price cuts, and night-weekend prices would not change. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, a spokesman for the rival <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said the company had not had a chance to study <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's proposal thoroughly, `` But, as usual, we plan to remain competitive with <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T.'' <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> <PERSON> Langley </PERSON>, a spokeswoman at another competitor, <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sprint </LOCATION>, said: `` In the past we have followed suit, and I anticipate that we will do that in this issue also Those reductions affect us in a slightly different way, but we will pass on whatever is appropriate -LRB- to our customers -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimmelman </PERSON>, legislative director for the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, complained that <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T was not cutting prices signigicantly in the heavily used night and weekend long-distance time periods. `` It's unfair that consumers have to pay 30 cents more on their local bill without receiving any rate reduction for the long-distance service they use most,'' <PERSON> Kimmelman </PERSON> said in an interview. He said the price cut plan bodes ill for customers if <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T is given more flexibility to set prices, as has been proposed by <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>. `` If this is a sign of what <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> does when given pricing flexibility, it means that less regulation will deny consumers the price reductions for evening, night and weekend services they've experienced in the last three or four years,'' <PERSON> Kimmelman </PERSON> said Under <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal: _ Basic long-distance service prices would drop an average 1.6 percent Day prices would decrease 3.8 percent, while evening prices would decrease 0.4 percent. _ Rates for <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> WATS </ORGANIZATION> calls would drop an average 3.9 percent _ PRO WATS rates would drop an average 3.8 percent _ <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> MEGACOM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> WATS </ORGANIZATION> rates wouild drop 1.1 percent, and <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> MEGACOM </ORGANIZATION> 800 prices would be 5.2 percent lower _ Basic <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T 800 service would drop 0.9 percent in price, while 800 Readyline service would decrease 3.3 percent Beginning July 1, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T 800 service will be billed according to distance, and there will be additional price reductions of 1.9 percent for 800 service and 2 percent for 800 Readyline. _ <ORGANIZATION> Software </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defined </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> prices will decline an average 6.1 percent

<HEAD>Administration Relents on `Zero Tolerance' Boat Seizures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government is softening its `` zero tolerance'' policy of seizing boats where drugs are found, saying small amounts will no longer be sufficient reason to seize commercial fishing vessels while in operation. Interim guidelines, written to conform with a congressional mandate that was attached to last November's anti-drug package, were expected to be announced today by <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Adm. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON>, government officials said Wednesday. Under the policy that began last March, federal agents were free to seize vessels within 12 miles of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> coastline if any amount of illegal drugs was found on board. Recreational boat owners were furious, complaining that they could face the loss of millions of dollars worth of property if a crew member or guest possessed a trace of marijuana without the boat owner's knowledge. And commercial fishermen said they could lose their livelihoods even if they were eventually found innocent and their vessels were returned. Late last year, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> narrowly approved modifications that would, in the words of Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, `` prevent innocent owners of fishing vessels from being persecuted by well-meaning but overexcited enforcement agents.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> instructed the executive branch to issue new regulations within 60 days and then hold a 30-day public comment period. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration already is a month late, and <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials said they do not expect formal regulations to be proposed for at least several weeks. But <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> and <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON>, in a joint announcement, are issuing interim rules for commercial fishing boats, said officials from their agencies, speaking on condition of anonymity. Under the new rules, seizures of commercial fishing vessels in operation or en route to or from fishery operations will be prohibited if the drugs found are in `` personal use quantities.'' That is generally described as less than one gram of cocaine or heroin and less than one ounce of marijuana. Instead of being immediately seized and escorted to port to await forfeiture proceedings by the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, fishing vessel operators will be given a summons and ordered to appear before the agency at the completion of the fishing trip. Customs officials then will decide whether the vessel should be forfeited or if a penalty should be imposed. The joint Customs-Coast Guard announcement also outlines expedited administrative procedures for the forfeiture process, setting a maximum 20-day period for a final decision. The announcement will not, however, detail other congressionally mandated changes in the zero tolerance policy, including a provision to protect innocent owners by ordering a vessel's release if owners can prove drug offenses occurred without their knowledge or consent.

<HEAD>Book Says Bugging Devices Found in Moscow Embassy Code Rooms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> is denying a report that Americans found bugging devices in the old <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> while investigating allegations that Marine guards let the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> into the facility. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, also denied allegations that it withheld information on the discovery of the listening devices from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which administers the embassy. Both allegations were made by author <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> in his book, `` <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Station,'' which expands on earlier reports that the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> had gained access to the embassy and the highly protected code rooms by sexually compromising <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marine guards. <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> wrote that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> communications intelligence organization, discovered in 1987 that the Soviets had put listening devices in the Communications Programs Units, or code rooms, at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic missions in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> rarely comments on espionage matters. But <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> read a statement Wednesday that `` the intelligence community conducted a review of the evidence, and that review did not substantiate that the CPU area of the embassy was successfully penetrated by the Soviets.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also denied an allegation by <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> that the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION> kept the discovery secret from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` That is just not so,'' said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> took part in a damage assessment'' based on allegations that Marine guards had allowed the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> into secure sections of the embassy at night. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> declined to discuss previous reports that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence had discovered bugging devices which transmitted information about what was being written on typewriters in embassy offices other than the communications room. <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his home in <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, that the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> denial was part of a continuing coverup. `` I think that the intelligence agencies will justify lying in order to protect what they think is the national interest,'' he said. `` In this case they think it is the national interest to say that they found nothing, in order not to let the Soviets know what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> knows, and whether we can detect it.'' Because of <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> penetrations, said <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> covert activities in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> have been `` totally closed down.'' `` This wiped them out,'' said <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON>, a former newspaper reporter. He said that intelligence sources, whom he declined to identify by name, told him that as many as 25 Soviets were executed in the mid-1980s on charges of spying. Ten of them were in fact <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agents, <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> said. Possible KGB penetration of the embassy has been a matter of public discussion for two years. One Marine guard at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> told American investigators in 1987 that he had allowed Soviet agents into secure parts of the building at night, but he later recanted the confession. <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> argues in his book that the Marine, Cpl. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Bracey </PERSON>, was telling the truth the first time. <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> had gotten into the embassy several years earlier, apparently by sexually compromising Marine guards using Soviet women. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> was denying that Soviet listening devices had been found, said <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON>, in part out of `` embarrassment. They would claim that they did n't want the Soviets to find out what they learned about the bugs.'' He noted that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence officials still decline to show pictures of bugging devices reported to have been found in a new American embassy in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, although the plans to occupy the facility have been suspended because of the bugging. In the book, <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> wrote: `` In August 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION> made a startling discovery. The power line to the CPU in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> had been replaced. The discovery meant the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> could have diverted signals from cipher machines within the CPU to the outside. `` Next the <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION> found that eight-by-14-inch circuit boards, along with chips the size of quarters, had been replaced in the printers. The new components appered to be diverting uncoded signals from the ` red -LRB- uncoded -RRB- side' of the communications circuits to the power line, bypassing electronic filters that were supposed to trap any signals inside. In September 1987, <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION> found similar sinister devices in the CPU from <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>DOT Considering Petition To Overturn Burnley On Eastern</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> says an ethics official let him rule in a case involving <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> even though he was negotiating at the time for jobs with law firms linked to the company. The issue surfaced Wednesday when the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> asked the department to reject <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION>'s decision in December not to investigate <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>' operations. The union claimed a conflict of interest. The department said it is considering the request from the pilots' union. <LOCATION> Burnley </LOCATION> on Wednesday called the pilots' accusations `` both malicious and without foundation.'' <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> made his response in a statement released by the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> law firm of <ORGANIZATION> Shaw </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Potts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Trowbridge </PERSON> which he is joining March 1. In the statement, <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said he rejected the pilots' request last year to investigate Eastern only after the department's chief ethical officer `` assured me in writing that I was not disqualified from participating in the matter.'' A Dec. 13 <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> memorandum from ethics officer <PERSON> Rosalind </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Burnley </LOCATION> regarding the airline pilots' request says, `` You are not disqualified from particiapting in this matter. `` I made each decision based on my best judgment of the merits of each matter as set out in the record before me,'' <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said. He said no one at <ORGANIZATION> Shaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittman </ORGANIZATION> or any other firm he was considering communicated with him about the pilots' petition and no one at the firms represented `` any of the parties in the proceedings.'' Documents show that <LOCATION> Burnley </LOCATION> last Nov. 22 disqualified himself from matters involving <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Pittman </PERSON> and the firm of <ORGANIZATION> Patton </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boggs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Blow, whose partner <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> sits on <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s board. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday quoted <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Pittman </PERSON> partner <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Potts </PERSON> as saying the firm gave <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> a list of cases it was handling for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, both owned by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, but <PERSON> Potts </PERSON> said the firm was not handling the matter involving the pilots. <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Paris </PERSON> said the department would consider the pilots' petition to overturn <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION>'s action, but <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> said he did not know when a decision would be made. A department statement said the petition for reconsideration would be considered `` in the normal course.'' It noted that the law firm <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> is joining had requested and was being provided documents related to the matter. The pilots asked the department to reconsider <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to conduct a `` continuing fitness'' investigation of Eastern to see that the airline remains financially viable. <LOCATION> Burnley </LOCATION>, in rejecting the original petition, accused the union of trying to put pressure on Eastern by raising new safety concerns. The pilots' petition for reconsideration said that <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> overrode normal agency procedures in rejecting the petition himself rather than letting it be handled by an assistant secretary. The filing said <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION>'s actions `` strongly suggest a lack of complete independence or impartiality and an eye cocked towards subsequent private employment.'' It accused <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> of violating the department's ethics rules, which prohibit officials from engaging in actions that would benefit or would appear to benefit their own financial interests or those of prospective employers. The original pilots union petition accused <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> of threatening <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s financial viability by `` downsizing,'' including the planned sale of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s lucrative shuttle operations to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> real estate tycoon <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. That sale has received <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> approval but has not yet been approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>.

 The <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> family is now sleeping under the roof of the official vice presidential residence, but they wo n't be fully settled until the mansion is remodeled. The remodeling is designed to make the three-story Victorian house convenient for a family with three children and an arthritic dog, said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON>. The changes include reconfiguring the children's bedrooms on the third floor, and adding a bathroom, family room and laundry room on that floor. While Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> says she intends to do the children's laundry herself, there is a staff of stewards to cook and serve food at the house on the sprawling grounds of the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Soviet Economist Says Health Case Spending Will Increase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A leading Soviet economist says his government will fulfill its pledge to nearly double health care spending despite revelations that the state budget is running a severe deficit. `` We intend to reduce the deficit, but not at the cost of reducing social investment,'' said <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aganbegyan </PERSON>, one of the foremost proponents of the reforms being pushed by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Aganbegyan </PERSON>, secretary of the economics section of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, said in a speech Wednesday that the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> will meet a promise by Soviet Health Minister <PERSON> Evgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Chazov </PERSON> to boost health care spending. <PERSON> Chazov </PERSON>'s plan is to increase that spending from 100 billion rubles, $ 166 billion at current exchange rates, to 190 billion rubles, or $ 314 billion, for the five-year plan beginning in January 1990. State investment in health care fell during the 25 years before the reforms began in 1985, said <PERSON> Aganbegyan </PERSON>, and the reductions caused such negative trends as a drop in the average male life expectancy from 71 to 68 years. Under the Soviet socialist system, virtually all health care is provided through state institutions. <PERSON> Murrary </PERSON> <PERSON> Feshbach </PERSON>, a leading <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> expert on Soviet health and economic issues, called the <PERSON> Chazov </PERSON> goal a `` noble one'' that is needed to reverse deteriorating health conditions in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Feshbach </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, used statistical evidence in the 1970s to uncover the declining male life expectancy and other health problems that are now being discussed more openly in the Soviet press. As part of that openness, Soviet Finance Minister <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gostev </PERSON> revealed last October that the government, which had claimed a balanced budget since World War II, was running a $ 58 billion deficit. Last month, another economist active in the reform campaign, <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON>, said that the annual deficit was actually about $ 165 billion, or 11 percent of the gross national output, a figure that is similar to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> measure of gross national product but excludes personal services. By contrast, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> federal deficit is about 4 percent of GNP. <PERSON> Aganbegyan </PERSON> estimated the Soviet deficit at $ 182 billion, and said that $ 60 billion was financed through bank loans and the remaining $ 122 billion through assets held by Soviet savings institutions. <PERSON> Aganbegyan </PERSON> painted a largely optimistic picture of the Soviet economy in a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. He claimed that consumer production has grown 10 to 15 percent since <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power nearly four years ago. `` Of course, this is a modest beginning,'' he said. Soviet consumer production accounts for only 30 percent of total production, compared to 40 percent or more in Western nations.

 The White House and Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> are bickering over who will be President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s No. 2 official at the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, sources say. According to the sources, who demanded anonymity as a condition of speaking, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> wants <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> state agricultural commissioner, or <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, cotton warehouseman, to be his deputy secretary. But the sources said Wednesday that former <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> governor <PERSON> Louie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, 68, has recently become a top contender, although no final decision has been made. They said <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, who was governor in 1967-71, is well known in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and would have substantial support in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` This makes sense to the politicos,'' one source said. `` After what the South did to support <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, it deserves a payoff at <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said through a spokeswoman that the reports of bickering over the deputy's job were `` completely false'' and offered no further comment when queried by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. A White House official, who declined to be identified, also denied there was a dispute. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, contacted by telephone at his farm in <LOCATION> Barren </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> interviewed him `` several weeks ago'' for the deputy secretary's job. `` Beyond that, I do n't have any information, and any comment would have to come from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> was mentioned early as a possible choice for secretary of agriculture. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> settled instead on <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, a 58-year-old Nebraskan, who was <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative for 3 -LCB- years. One source said that <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> may have worked an informal deal with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to remain in the cabinet for only two years, on condition that <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> has a deputy trained and ready to step in when it comes time to leave. The possibility of a brief hitch at <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> surfaced when <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s appointment was announced but was discounted by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> staff people at the time According to the source, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was willing to accept <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s bid for an abbreviated tenure at <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> because the president felt <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s help on trade matters in the coming months and on pending farm legislation was essential. The current 5-year farm law expires in 1990. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> was reluctant to remain in government after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> left office, was ready to leave town quickly for the private sector and had been interviewed for several job possibilities until <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s appeal that he remain At least until now, <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON> have traded places as the lead contender for the deputy secretary's job, according to one of the sources. One of <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON>' supporters for the job is Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., who says a major new farm bill should not be high on <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s list of things to do in the next couple of years <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON>, who has been director of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> department of food and agriculture since June 1, 1987, has a 4,500-acre ranch and other business interests. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the leading farm state, was the home of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s predecessor, and has been using clout from a number of powerful farm and commodity organizations to maintain White House interest in <LOCATION> Parnell </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON>'s office in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> said he was away from the capital and could not be reached. A deputy, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> with the governor to open a new trade office. There has been `` lots of speculation'' about <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON> being headed for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> but nothing further, <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said. `` The latest we have is that there's no official notification -LRB- of <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON> -RRB- and no official decision,'' he said.

 Contracts for two nuclear-powered aircraft carriers helped propel <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> into second place in <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending by state last year, but it still lagged far behind the perennial leader <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Bucking a trend of `` procurement decrease'' in 32 states in fiscal 1988, the value of contracts awarded in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> rose 31 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said in a report released Wednesday. <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> contractors won $ 10.2 billion in awards, up from $ 7.8 billion in fiscal 1978, when the state finished fifth. Part of the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> increase came from contracts the <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Drydock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> received for two nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> contractors won $ 23.5 billion in awards, down 4.3 percent from the fiscal 1987 total of $ 24.5 billion. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is the home of many large aerospace, computer and electronic concerns that work on military weapon projects. <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> reported the biggest improvement, a 64.3 percent jump from $ 1.5 billion to $ 2.4 billion. The information on defense spending trends was contained in a statistical report entitled `` Prime Contract Awards by State.'' The latest <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report covers fiscal 1988, the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30. Eighteen states plus the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> reported gains, most of them small. Altogether, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the armed services and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> awarded contracts totaling $ 142.15 billion for work in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in fiscal 1988, compared to $ 147.15 billion in fiscal 1987 and $ 149.3 billion in fiscal 1986. For 1988, the Top 10 list showed <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> in third place with contracts totaling $ 9 billion, followed by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with $ 7.7 billion, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> with $ 7.2 billion, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> with $ 5.5 billion, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> with $ 5.3 billion, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> with $ 5.1 billion, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> with $ 4.9 billion and <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> with $ 4.3 billion. Those are the same Top 10 as in fiscal 1987, although the rankings changed. At the bottom of the list, the 10 states that benefitted the least from <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> contracts were <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> with $ 53.6 million in contracts, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> with $ 54.6 million, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> with $ 61.5 million, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> with $ 80.1 million, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> with $ 117.3 million, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> with $ 121.7 million, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> with $ 206.7 million, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> with $ 218.5 million, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> with $ 233.3 million, and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> with $ 258.5 million.

 Eye doctors should warn their contact lens patients that improper use of homemade salt solutions can lead to damaged vision and even blindness, the government says. The Food and Drug Administration, in a warning issued Wednesday, said the solutions are not sterile and can become contaminated with microorganisms that can cause serious and painful eye infections. Homemade salt solutions, prepared by dissolving salt tablets or capsules in water, can be used safely in heat disinfection of contact lenses or just before heat disinfection because the high temperature kills any germs that might be in the solution. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said that if homemade salt solutions are used, the solution should be prepared fresh daily and discarded after use and the solution bottle should be sterilized in boiling water for 10 minutes at least once a week.

His goal is to earn 12 master's degrees and at least one doctorate, probably in education. `` That will be a lot more impressive,'' he said recently. <PERSON> Tellefsen </PERSON> says he has attended four or five colleges at the same time in his quest for knowledge. He traces his desire to learn to his 20s, when he worked minimum-wage jobs. `` A lot of guys would give me orders, and the only difference was that they had degrees. I wanted to try to be on the same level with these people.'' <PERSON> Tellefsen </PERSON> supports himself on student loans and occasional part-time jobs, and says he owes the federal government about $ 49,000 that he'll have to pay back when he finally leaves school. `` I'll have to make sure I get a good job,'' he said.

<HEAD>More Americans Dying In Nursing Homes As Hospitals Save Money</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans are increasingly going to nursing homes to die as hospitals discharge terminally ill patients to keep them from running up big bills, thus helping reduce the nation's <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> costs, according to two reports today. One study, based on nationwide death statistics, suggests that the trend results largely from new Medicare rules that pay hospitals flat fees for taking care of the elderly. This approach gives them a financial incentive to keep patients' hospital stays as short as possible. `` What has to be said is that hospitals are in a bind because they are being pressured by cost cutting,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sager </PERSON>, who directed the study. `` Nursing homes are in a bind because nobody wants to pay for nursing home care. Patients are in a bind because they are in a system that does not want to provide continuity of care and health care financing is fragmented.'' His research showed that the number of elderly Americans dying in nursing homes rose sharply during the 1980s, while fewer died in hospitals. <PERSON> Sager </PERSON>, a physician at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, said that sending dying people to nursing homes rather than keeping them in hospitals `` may be very appropriate and less costly.'' `` The issue is whether nursing homes can adequately take care of a sicker population today than they were seeing a few years ago,'' he said. Medicare's new system began in October 1983, paying hospitals flat fees in advance. Hospitals get the same amount for each person with a specific disease, regardless of whether a patient stays in the hospital for a day or a month. Another report provides evidence that the strategy is saving money. That study, directed by Dr. <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, estimated the savings to <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> from the new payment system and compared <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>'s projections of rising costs with what actually happened. In 1980, the <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, the federal government's branch that pays <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> hospital bills, predicted that it would be spending about $ 55 billion by 1990. Instead, it appears the actual expense by then will be $ 43 billion in 1980 dollars. The savings will amount to $ 12 billion in 1980 dollars or $ 18 billion in 1990 dollars. The researchers said this means the new payment program will be responsible for a 3 percent reduction in the nation's total health care bill, which is expected to be $ 650 billion in 1990. Both studies were published in today's New England Journal of Medicine. <PERSON> Sager </PERSON>'s study found that in 1981, 65 percent of all deaths among people older than 65 occurred in hospitals. By 1985, this had fallen to 61 percent. At the same time, the percentage of deaths in nursing homes rose from 19 percent to 21.5 percent. <PERSON> Sager </PERSON> said that although he is concerned about whether nursing homes can adequately care for their increased burden of dying patients, there is no sign that quicker hospital discharges have shortened people's lives. His study, which used mortality data from all 50 states compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>, found that the changes were most pronounced in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and West. He attributed that in part to the heavy concentration of health maintenance organizations in some states in these regions. `` HMOs save money by reducing rates of hospitalization,'' said <PERSON> Sager </PERSON>. `` Hospitals in high-HMO states may have already experienced significant cost cutting'' before the Medicare program began. `` They were much more threatened by the prospective payment system.'' <PERSON> Sager </PERSON>'s work showed that between 1983 and 1984, 35 states showed significant declines in hospital deaths, and 33 had increases in nursing homes deaths. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> _ states that did not participate at first in the new payment system _ there was no change in where people died.

 An out-of-bounds skier who was buried in an avalanche that killed two companions said he had given up hope and placed his ski pass around his neck to be identified when his body was found. `` I'd given up,'' <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Chelmsford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview Wednesday, one day after his rescue near the <LOCATION> Telluride </LOCATION> ski area. `` So I prayed a little. I did n't expect anybody to come looking for me.'' He spoke from a hospital in <LOCATION> Montrose </LOCATION>, which lies between Grand Junction and <LOCATION> Telluride </LOCATION> on the western slope of the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION>. He is recovering from frostbite, hypothermia and bruises sustained in the avalanche. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> was found by a dozen local skiers who had been coming down legally nearby and heard his screams for help, authorities said. His two companions, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelly </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Wellington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolford </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, were killed in the avalanche. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said he had resigned himself to dying and had put his laminated employee ski pass, which he had been using to dig, around his neck `` so it would be easy to identify me.'' The three young men were spending the winter in <LOCATION> Telluride </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shelly </PERSON> worked for the <ORGANIZATION> Telluride </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ski </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Wolford </ORGANIZATION> was employed at a local restaurant. <PERSON> Shelly </PERSON> `` was leaving this weekend to go home,'' <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Shelly </PERSON> were friends. He said they met <ORGANIZATION> Wolford </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday morning at <LOCATION> Telluride </LOCATION> mountain and decided to go skiing out of bounds toward a narrow, steep, powder-filled chute. `` If you go backcountry, you're on your own,'' <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said. `` We knew that. That's why I did n't expect anybody to come looking for me.'' About 11:30 a.m. Tuesday, the party stopped at the top of the chute. <ORGANIZATION> Wolford </ORGANIZATION> was putting on a ski that had come off and <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> took off his gloves to take a picture of the spectacular mountains. `` I saw it coming 300 or 400 feet above me,'' <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said. `` I turned and yelled at my friend and when I turned back, it was in my face. `` It hit me like a Mack truck. It picked me up right out of my skis. It took me down about 2,000 vertical feet including over a cliff that had to be at least 150 feet high. But it was taking me out as much as down. I'd have to guess 70 mph.'' <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Masters </PERSON> said it appeared <PERSON> Shelly </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Wolford </ORGANIZATION> died of suffocation and multiple broken bones. He added that <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> may be cited for illegally skiing out of bounds. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said he expects to be charged for rescue payments but is `` obviously grateful to the people who pulled me out.'' A ski instructor who tends bar at night, <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said he is n't sure he will stay in <LOCATION> Telluride </LOCATION> `` Part of my job as a ski instructor is to calm people down about their fears,'' he said. `` I'm not sure I could do that right now.

 The dollar rebounded slightly against the Japanese yen Thursday, while the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s leading index fell back from its latest record high. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 65.90 points, or 0.20 percent, closing at 32,083.58, despite a gain in morning trading.

After opening at 126.35 yen, the currency moved in a range of 126.18-126 .53 yen It had lost a total of 2.40 yen in the previous two trading sessions.

<HEAD>Stanford Accused Of Exploiting Migrant Farm Workers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>STANFORD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Impoverished migrant workers crammed into wooden shacks on one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most beautiful college campuses are at the center of a dispute over who's legally responsible for their misery. On one side of the wrangle is prestigious <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. On the other is <ORGANIZATION> Webb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranch </ORGANIZATION>, which leases 300 acres from the school and pays the migrants wages below the poverty line to pick berries and vegetables. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> charges 75 cents out of every hour worked for rent, so the more hours worked the higher the rent, said <PERSON> Reuben </PERSON> <PERSON> Serna </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, the union representing 1,200 maintenance workers at the school. The shacks are a half-mile from the center of campus and have no heat, toilets or running water. During harvest time, they are crowded with up to eight people who pay up to $ 1,600 a month for the space, <PERSON> Serna </PERSON> said. The migrants have asked the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> to represent them. Earlier this week the union sent university President <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and the ranch a letter demanding recognition as sole bargaining agent for the farm workers. Union attorney <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Eggleston </PERSON> claims that <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION>, as the land's owner, is the workers' true employer under state law and is legally responsible `` for the shameful activity that's going on here. `` There are more illegalities, more exploitation of workers, more breaches of workers' rights in this one plot of ground right here than we've seen in a long, long time,' he said Wednesday. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> declined to comment on the issue, but <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Priscilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> said the university is n't responsible for the employment policies of its lessees or contractors. `` We would, of course, be concerned if any lessee violated the law,'' <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> said in a statement. `` So far as we know, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranch </PERSON> has not done so. If there are issues of mistreatment, we hope they are brought up with the state.'' <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> acknowledged that the migrants sometimes work on campus as contract workers, but said there is no basis for the union's claim that the university is a joint employer with <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> If <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> refuse to accept the bargaining demand by Friday, the union plans to file a petition with the state <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> that could lead to a vote by the migrants on representation, <PERSON> Eggleston </PERSON> said. Union officials said <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> receives $ 8.50 an hour for the contract workers, but pays them only $ 4.25 and pockets the rest. Ranch manager <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> was not available for comment, his office said. Other ranch officials declined to comment. Whatever doubt remains about the migrants' legal employer, no one denies that their poor living conditions make a striking contrast to the campus 30 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, which covers thousands of acres and boasts elegant Spanish-style buildings and eucalyptus trees. `` I think this is a step backward in history,'' said <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulaski </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mateo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's somewhat reminiscent of the company towns, where the employers control people not only at work but at home after work. ... <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> is acting like a Third World employer here.'' <PERSON> Tibuecio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabrera </PERSON>, 67, and his 58-year-old wife, <PERSON> Cointa </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON>, are among up to 90 migrants _ including as many as 20 children _ who live in four wooden sheds with four rooms each. Only a few speak any English or read. <PERSON> Cabrera </PERSON> and his wife have shivered through the winter with the warmth of only a small electric heater and some blankets. They have a hot plate to make tortillas, but there is no running water in their 7-by-8-foot room. Light comes from a bare bulb dangling from a wire tacked to a wall. <PERSON> Cabrera </PERSON>'s last monthly pay receipt shows he worked 194 hours and earned $ 824.50. But he took home $ 514.86 after deductions for Social Security, unemployment tax, a $ 50 personal advance, rent and utilities. Like the others, <PERSON> Cabrera </PERSON> received no health care, no holidays and no vacation. He said he had to use all his savings to pay for a stomach ailment and got no help from <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> or <LOCATION> Stanford </LOCATION>. The camp has only one portable toilet and three indoor toilets with no partitions between them for both men and women. There is a communal kitchen with immovable metal seats for eight. Refrigerators are padlocked between meals. `` I sometimes get angry, but I have to comfort myself,'' <PERSON> Cabrera </PERSON> said. `` What else can I do?'' <PERSON> Eggleston </PERSON> said the migrants have long been afraid to speak out because they were illegal aliens from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, but were emboldened by their protection under the federal amnesty program to ask his union for representation.

 A memorial to President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> on the sixth floor of the former <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schoolbook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depository </ORGANIZATION>, from which <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> allegedly fired the shots that killed him, will open on Presidents Day, organizers say. The exhibit titled `` The Sixth Floor: <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and the Memory of a Nation'' does not dwell on the 1963 assassination in its photos, films and other items, but on the slain president's legacy, its creators said Wednesday. `` This exhibit is an attempt to deal with it positively, in that it is educational. It is objective. I think it is extremely sensitive, and I think it is dignified,'' said <PERSON> Conover </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, the exhibit's project director. The 9,000-square-foot exhibit, which opens to the public Monday, includes 350 photographs, 30 original artifacts, a 30-minute audio tour and six films. It was built at a cost of $ 1.3 million and organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. An estimated 500,000 visitors a year will view the exhibit, which covers <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s political career, his assassination on Nov. 22, 1963, and the investigations that followed, Ms. <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said. Reporters were given a preview Wednesday of the exhibit, which is housed in what is now the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Administration Building. Replicas of schoolbook boxes are stacked near the southeast corner window from which <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> allegedly fired the fatal shots. The area is sealed off, but visitors will be able to look through a glass partition and adjacent windows to <LOCATION> Dealey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION> and the Kennedy motorcade route. `` The exhibit has extraordinarily famous photographs, taken by some of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most talented photographers through the years,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said. `` We looked at thousands of visuals to select the 350 that are in this exhibit.'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, who with his wife, <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON>, produced and directed the films, said one segment has the formidable task of chronicling `` 1,000 days of the Kennedy presidency in five minutes.'' `` We did not want museum visitors, through these films, to feel that they were in a morbid place that concerned death,'' <PERSON> Mondell </PERSON> said. `` But we wanted to convey hope for the future _ the <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> legacy.'' All visitors will undergo a security check, using a metal detector and X-ray machine, before entering the ground-floor visitors' center, which was built at a cost of $ 2.2 million. `` Vandalism is a major concern in museums,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said. Thousands of tourists have come to the building previously, but could not go to the sixth floor because it was closed. County officials have been developing plans to convert the sixth floor into an exhibit area since 1981, but the project was stalled by financial problems. <PERSON> Melody </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> spokeswoman for Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., said the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> family would not comment on the exhibit `` They prefer to focus on President's <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s life, not his death. They will remember him on May 29, his birthday,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> dismissed claims that his promise to hold free elections is insincere, telling the nation he can now promote democracy because the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> are strong and backed by the people. In a televised speech Wednesday night, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> also hinted that he might run for re-election. At the end of a regional summit Tuesday in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, he promised to hold presidential, legislative and municipal elections by next February and to allow the opposition help organize them. The summit agreement signed by five <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents also calls for disbanding of the Contra guerrillas, most of whom are encamped in neighboring <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. `` We'll see who is strong, who the people will vote for,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. `` Whoever is afraid of this -LRB- early elections -RRB- is not interested in peace or in the strengthening of democracy in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' The balloting had been scheduled for November 1990. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> signaled its skepticism about free elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> by saying it had no plans to lift a four-year ban on diplomatic contacts with the leftist Sandinista government. Rebel leaders said they felt abandoned by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which had supported their seven-year fight to oust the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. The accords left the Contras isolated diplomatically, with about 11,000 fighters and several thousand relatives in neighboring <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. Despite vows to fight on, they ran out of ammunition and moved into the border camps after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> suspended military aid a year ago. On March 23, they signed a preliminary cease-fire accord with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. Asked by reportres what would happen if the Contras refused to lay down their arms and relocate, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said: `` The Contras are creating a problem for <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. ... You ca n't force them to return to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> But they will have to choose between coming here, staying _ some of them _ in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, or leaving for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or whatever other countries are willing to take them in.'' One opposition leader said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> must be watched carefully in the elections or they'll try to cheat. `` President <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> only talked with the Central American presidents, but he still needs to talk with the Nicaraguan people,'' said <PERSON> Gilberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuadra </PERSON>, president of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>' popularity has been hurt by the state of the economy. Inflation is at a 20,000 percent annual rate, food and consumer goods are in short supply and at least 30,000 public employees have just been laid off. The government says the war is mostly to blame for the state of the economy, not their management of it. Opposition leaders said Wednesday that elections as early as next February do not allow enough time for political parties to organize a campaign. In his nationwide address, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> went over the points contained in a communique he issued jointly with the presidents of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> at their summit. He stressed his willingness to promote greater democracy and submit elections to international observers, saying this `` shows our political strength, which is rooted in the Nicaraguan people, the working people, the peasants ... and every patriotic Nicaraguan.'' Speaking to journalists afterward, he was asked if he would be the Sandinista presidential candidate. `` We have to consider that re-election is no crime. Even -LRB- former President -RRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ... complained that it was undemocratic that he could not run for office again,'' he said. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> was asked how he interpreted the fact that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had not publicly established his policy toward <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and the rest of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>: `` That fact in itself shows a different policy.'' Earlier, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said he told the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents `` <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> would not be promoting the political and economic actions it has been promoting since the start of the year if <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy had been maintained along the lines of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.'' Government representatives have been meeting with labor, business and opposition parties seeking a commitment to support the government's economic plan, one highlighted by tough austerity measures to curb hyperinflation and increase productivity.

Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, requested an investigation Wednesday and also asked for a formal explanation from <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, chairman of he <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> that regulates S & amp; Ls. `` At a time when the American taxpayer is being called upon to provide billions of dollars to bail out savings and loans, it is a scandal that -LRB- officials -RRB- treat assets as personal accounts'' for use by `` friends and cronies,'' <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> said in a letter Tuesday to Wall. According to a congressional source, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Duvall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> paid no rent from mid-1987 until it vacated the <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> building last month for 1,200 square feet of office space. The building is owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an agency established by the <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to dispose of property the government acquires in closing down or merging insolvent S & amp; Ls, said the source, speaking on the condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on commerce, consumer protection and competitiveness, specifically asked the General Accounting if the <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> arrangement violated federal laws prohibiting the government from making political contributions or giving away federal property. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION>'s president, was out of town Wednesday night and unreachable, his wife said. But The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> as saying earlier that he had not learned of the <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> arrangement until December and had ordered the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> to vacate the premises within a week. The congressional source said the subcommittee has documentation that <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had been aware for six months of the party's rent-free use of the office space. Meanwhile, the bank board system through which the government regulates and insures S & amp; Ls and sells home mortgages has donated a total of $ 21,600 to a think tank named in honor of Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, who co-wrote a 1982 law deregulating the industry, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. A report issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Garn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION>, which was started in 1986 and is affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION>, showed a $ 6,000 contribution from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> agency that insures S & amp; L despositors, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. In addition, the report listed contributions totaling $ 5,100 from district <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and $ 10.6,000 from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> agency that buys and sells home mortgages. Wall was quoted by the Post as saying he was unaware of the contributions to the <ORGANIZATION> Garn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. But he dismissed their relevancy, saying, `` What's the point?'' Before becoming the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> was a top aide to <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s leading index fell today from its latest record high as cautious investors began selling, and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar rebounded moderately against the Japanese yen. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which climbed 166.59 points to a record closing of 32,149.48 on Wednesday, gained nearly 200 more points in this morning's trading. But a plunge in the afternoon left the index at 32,083.58 at the close, down 65.0 points, or 0.20 percent, from Wednesday's close. A <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> dealer said the morning's sharp gain made investors cautious in the afternoon. `` Participants first started selling construction issues, which prompted the selling trend in the afternoon,'' said the dealer, speaking on condition of anonymity. As the index fell, he said, many investors retreated to the sidelines to see what the West German central bank council might do later today. There has been speculation it might raise its official discount rate, pushing up German interest rates. Investors also wanted to wait for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures for December, due to be released Friday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the dealer said. Trading was heavy, with first section volume estimated at 1.9 billion shares. In addition to construction shares, electrical and chemical issues lost ground. The dollar closed at 126.33 yen, up 0.43 yen from Wednesday's 125.90-yen close The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency opened at 126.35 yen and traded in a range of 126.18-126 .53 yen It had dropped a total of 2.40 yen on the previous two trading days.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> says he is pulling out of the race for a territorial seat in the new national legislature because he believes he should represent the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. The prestigious academy's governing body last month rejected <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s candidacy, a move that critics of the new electoral system said showed entrenched <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> bureaucrats' advantage in the nominating process. `` I feel that I am inseparably linked with the academy, of which I have been a member 35 years,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said in a letter published Wednesday in the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News. The 67-year-old physicist, who won the 1975 Nobel Peace prize, has been nominated to represent a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> district in the new 2,250-seat <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>. But hundreds of his colleagues at the academy want him to represent them. `` I have come to the conclusion that I should be a candidate namely of the academy in the new elections or not be one at all,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> wrote in the letter to the weekly newspaper. `` Therefore, I am taking the decision not to run anywhere except the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION>, withdrawing my consent to run from all territorial and national-territorial districts which fielded my candidacy.'' The new congress, announced in December by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, will meet annually and choose the Soviet president and members of a new, smaller and more active sitting parliament, or Supreme Soviet. A third of the deputies are to be chosen from among candidates nominated not on the traditional basis of geographic districts but from the party, unions, professional organizations and other officially recognized groups. Candidates may not espouse views contrary to the constitution, which enshrines the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> as the leading force in society, and there has been considerable controversy over how some of the candidates have been chosen. The territorial deputies will be chosen by voters on March 26. Deputies from public organizations will be elected at meetings of those groups in the weeks preceding the territorial balloting. On Feb. 2, more than 1,000 <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> workers rallied to protest the organization's rejection of the candidacies of <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and several other prominent intellectuals. They said the academy leadership had failed to listen to the popular will. In a letter accompanying <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s Wednesday in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News, space scientist <PERSON> Roald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagdeyev </PERSON> said he supported his colleague's decision to pull out of the race and hoped the academy leadership would reverse its decision and `` find a way'' to nominate <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagdeyev </PERSON> also was passed over as an academy nominee. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, who is currently visiting <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, was freed from internal exile in <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION> in December 1986.

<HEAD>Lasers Safely Remove Port-Wine Stain Birthmarks in Children</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Children born with purple birthmarks known as port-wine stains can be treated with lasers that erase their blemishes without leaving scars, a report today shows. A review of the treatment found that it removed the birthmarks in 94 percent of cases, leaving normal-looking skin. The birthmarks are usually harmless and occur in about three of every 1,000 people, often on the face. `` We hope to get rid of these lesions before children go to school, where they have had severe psychological problems from teasing and bullying,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Oon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tian </PERSON> <PERSON> Tan </PERSON>, who has worked with the laser at the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>. Doctors have used similar lasers for several years to lighten the birth marks in adults, but they could not be used in children because they left scars. The latest laser can be fine-tuned so that it destroys just the abnormal blood vessels that cause the port-wine stains. Surrounding normal tissue is unharmed. In a report in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Tan </PERSON> described her experience with the laser in 35 children who ranged in age from 3 months to 14 years. In 33 of them, the birthmarks disappeared completely. The latest approach uses a device called a flashlamp-pulsed tunable dye laser. It was developed at <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and produced by <ORGANIZATION> Candela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Wayland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> approved it for routine use in November 1986. `` When we completely cleared the patient of port-wine stain, we got normal skin that is indistinguishable from adjacent skin with normal pigmentation, normal texture and normal hair growth,'' <PERSON> Tan </PERSON> said in an interview. `` The only structure that was destroyed was the abnormal blood vessels.'' Two of Tan's initial patients had small, isolated, depressed scars when their skin was accidentally injured soon after the laser treatment. Dr. <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Garden </PERSON>, who has also extensively used the laser in children and adults, agreed that the treatment rarely causes scars. But he questioned whether it produces such uniformly complete removal of birthmarks as Tan found. `` I just do n't feel that the amount of lightening she is getting is the same as other people are seeing, me included,'' said Garden of <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Nonetheless, <PERSON> Garden </PERSON> said that although his results have been less impressive than Tan's, `` the important issue is that until this time, any laser that was used in children, especially infants, would have a very real risk of scarring. This has diminished that risk unbelievably, to the point that none of my patients have scarred.'' Port-wine stain is an abnormality resulting from overgrowth of enlarged blood vessels in the skin. Lasers produce intense beams of light. Their effects on the body vary, depending on their color or wavelength. When used by skin specialists, the new tunable dye laser produces yellow light. It passes harmlessly through normal skin but is absorbed by anything that is red. When aimed at port-wine stains, the laser selectively burns the enlarged blood vessels.

<HEAD>Luck, As Much As Skill, Prevented Nuclear War In Cuban Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s moderate response during the Cuban missile crisis was perceived instead as `` a virtual declaration of war'' by the Soviets, and Premier <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khruschev </PERSON> backed down from the brink for unexpected reasons, scholars now say. Newly declassified documents indicate that luck, as well as skill, played a great role in resolving the world's last major nuclear crisis 27 years ago, Soviet and American experts at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> made key decisions based on serious misperceptions and faulty intelligence, which, however, may have helped to resolve the crisis as well as to start it, said <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allison </PERSON>, dean of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION>. `` Looking at it in retrospect, with all the new information, I still give high marks to President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and ... also, perhaps surprisingly, to <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, for the degree of control they tried to exercise,'' said <PERSON> Allison </PERSON>, author of `` Essence of Decision,'' one of the authoritative books on the crisis. `` But nonetheless, it is now clear that there was a great component of good fortune. It was a combination of extraordinary skill, extraordinary courage and equally extraordinary good luck that permitted us to avoid catastrophe,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> researcher <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blight </PERSON> said the documents, examined during two recent international conferences, demonstrate that the Soviets knew about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> covert operations to destabilize the Cuban regime. The Soviets had put the missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> mainly because they believed a full-scale Marine invasion was likely, said <PERSON> Blight </PERSON>, co-author of a new book, `` On The Brink: Americans and Soviets Reexamine the Cuban Missile Crisis.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and his advisers believed that setting up a naval blockade was `` a relatively mild response'' to the missiles that would help defuse the crisis by rendering an invasion unnecessary. `` They had no idea that the way that blockade would be perceived in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was as a prelude to an invasion and a virtual declaration of war,'' <PERSON> Blight </PERSON> said. Indeed, the documents reveal that an enraged <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> ordered Soviet ships to steam through the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> blockade, but the order was reversed by <PERSON> Anastas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikoyan </PERSON>, the first deputy Soviet premier, just hours before a military confrontation would have occurred. It remains unclear whether <PERSON> Mikoyan </PERSON> circumvented the decision on his own or obtained <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>'s permission to change it. <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> said it now appears that <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> gave in partly because he had received an urgent message from <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, dictated from a bunker, saying an American military attack was imminent. A Soviet general, <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Volkogonov </PERSON>, also advised that an attack was coming, which turned out not to be true, said <PERSON> Allison </PERSON>, author of `` Essence of Decision,'' a classic 1971 study of the crisis. The crisis flared on Oct. 15, 1962, when a high-flying American U-2 spy plane photographed the installation of nuclear-tipped Soviet SS-4 and SS-5 missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> deliberated secretly with his aides for a week before announcing a naval quarantine of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and a demand that the Soviets withdraw the missiles. The world sat glued to television sets and radios as Soviet ships steamed toward the blockade and what seemed to be an inevitable military confrontation. But the Soviet ships stopped short, and the Soviets and Americans came to peaceful terms. The historical re-examination, organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, included a reunion of former <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> advisers on <LOCATION> Hawks </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, in March 1987; a conference of Soviet and American experts and officials at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> in October 1987; and a second conference that included <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> officials last month in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Among the other revelations it has produced: _ <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> intelligence estimates of Soviet and Cuban troop strength were way off. According to Cuban Politburo member <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Risquet </PERSON>, 270,000 troops were ready to go to war, including 42,000 Soviet soldiers _ four times the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> estimate at the time. _ <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> may have asked the Soviets to launch a pre-emptive nuclear attack <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, son of the former Soviet leader, reportedly described <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s request in private conversations at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> conference but has since denied he said such a thing. _ Soviet and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leaders believed a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion was imminent before the missiles were installed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, including former Secretary of Defense <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> and former National Security adviser <PERSON> McGeorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, have said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had no such plans although a recently declassified memo indicates there were contingency plans set. `` In the analyses at the time and ever since, we thought the only real reason for their putting missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> was to put the American homeland at risk and change the strategic balance _ and the defense of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> was regarded as a kind of hoked-up piece of propaganda,'' said Blight.

Trunk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ELKRIDGE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> told her children when they were young never to touch the old steamer trunk in the basement. Before she died, however, she asked them to take care of what was inside of it. Expecting to find her will when they opened the trunk Wednesday, her son and daughter were shocked to discover the blanket-wrapped skeleton of an infant, a Bible, a small chest and the remnants of a baby's white dress, police said. The 67-year-old <LOCATION> Elkridge </LOCATION> woman may well have taken the secret of the trunk's contents to her grave when she died Monday, police said. A police search of the house turned up no sign of a will or anything to explain the infant's remains, state police Detective <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davey </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Shields </PERSON>' children, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, 29, and <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>, 31, told investigators they could remember no family discussions about an infant brother or sister who may have died at birth or shortly thereafter. Nor did they recall their mother ever being pregnant while they were growing up, <PERSON> Davey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Davey </PERSON> said the infant was full-term and may have been stillborn or died soon after birth, possibly as long as 30 years ago. The remains were sent to the state medical examiner's office. Both children still live in the house. They declined to comment to The -LRB- <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> -RRB- Sun on Wednesday. Mrs. <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, had lived in <LOCATION> Elkridge </LOCATION>, a small town about eight miles south of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, for about 20 years. Her husband died of lung cancer while the children were young. Neighbors described Mrs. <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> as sometimes belligerent with children who came on her property but so generous to squirrels that they would come to her door for food. She kept a well-stocked bird feeder and often asked her neighbor to buy nuts for her to feed the squirrels, said <PERSON> Peg </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, who lives next door. Neighbors said she spent much of each day listening to a police scanner and seldom left the house. They said she had been in poor health for several months before her death. `` People who had an opportunity to get to know her really liked her,'' Ms. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Chemical Structure of AIDS Virus Enzyme Found, May Lead to New Drugs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scientists said today they had discovered the three-dimensional structure of a crucial protein made by the AIDS virus, defining a target for potential new AIDS drugs. The discovery will aid attempts to design drugs that block the action of the protein, crippling the ability of the virus to spread its infection, researchers said. While such a drug would not cure acquired immune deficiency syndrome, it might keep the disease under control, said researcher <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Navia </PERSON>. He and eight other scientists from the <ORGANIZATION> Merck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sharp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dohme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rahway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>., <LOCATION> Penn. </LOCATION>, report their discovery of the protein's structure in today's issue of the British journal Nature The accomplishment, the first time a three-dimensional structure has been reported for any AIDS virus protein, is `` pretty dramatic,'' commented AIDS researcher <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Haseltine </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Dana-Farber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> called the finding `` an important and critical step along the pathway to rational, anti-AIDS drug development.'' The protein is an enzyme, which is a class of substances that permit or speed up chemical reactions. The AIDS enzyme comes into play as the virus makes more copies of itself. After the virus infects a cell, it orders the cell's protein-making machinery to make proteins for producing new viruses The proteins are manufactured in a string, like cars on a train, and they will not function unless separated. The newly analyzed enzyme is reponsible for cutting the proteins apart. If the enzyme fails to do its job, the newly produced viruses can not infect other cells, <PERSON> Navia </PERSON> said. So a drug that blocks the enzyme should stop the spread of infection, he said. <PERSON> Haseltine </PERSON> said such a drug should also keep an infected person from being infectious to others. Researchers would have to make sure that the drug would not block similar enzymes elsewhere in a person's body, <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said. The structure of the AIDS enzyme looks like a tangled string in the general shape of an angelfish. It is formed by the joining of two identical structures.

<TEXT>
 Movie studios began boasting today about their Oscar nominations, which included a torrent for `` Rain Man'' and an overtime bonus for the hardworking <PERSON> Sigourney </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>. `` Rain Man'' received eight nominations Wednesday and Miss <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> earned two in Academy Award selections that also were notable for some prominent omissions. All five of the best picture nominees came at years' end. Despite a heavy campaign to remind Academy voters, the early release `` The Unbearable Lightness of Being'' bagged no major prize, nor did `` Bull <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>,'' `` Dead Ringers'' or <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON>'s `` Bird.'' Yet the voters did remember <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmos </PERSON>' courageous school teacher in `` Stand and Deliver,'' released well over a year ago. Miss <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> will have Oscar voters seeing double. She was nominated for best actress in the drama `` Gorillas in the Mist'' and for best supporting actress in the comedy `` Working Girl.'' `` All the Working Girls have come out on top!'' she said. <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> received a best actress nomination for `` Working Girl,'' in which she played an ambitious secretary with an imperious boss _ Miss <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>, makers of top <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> nominee `` Rain Man,'' placed national newspaper ads touting their film's eight nominations, which included best picture, best actor for <PERSON> Dustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> and best director for <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON>. `` We're very, very proud of our movie,'' said studio spokeswoman <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Geller </PERSON>. They were eager as well. In what <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> called `` a mistake'' but looked more like a calculated gamble, <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> ran advertisements in Wednesday morning newspapers _ printed before the nomination announcements _ calling `` Rain Man'' an `` Academy Award Nominee.'' 20th Century <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> published new advertisements today celebrating the success of `` Working Girl,'' which snared six nominations, including best picture. Analysts figure that nominations can boost a film's gross by $ 10 million, while a best picture Oscar can mean $ 20 million in extra revenues. The award ceremonies will be held in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on March 29. Some of the most popular and most widely discussed pictures of the year were all but ignored by the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON>, whose all-time box office champion `` E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'' never landed a major <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON>, was similarly ignored for `` Who Framed <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbit </PERSON>,'' 1988's top ticket seller, which won only technical nominations. `` The Last Temptation of Christ,'' the year's most controversial film, won only one nomination, for <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorcese </PERSON>'s direction. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarandon </PERSON> was overlooked despite a critically acclaimed performance in `` Bull Durham.'' For those who did receive nominations, it was a memorable day. `` It's a wonderful way to wake up, really an incredible way to wake up,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Landau </PERSON>, who was awakened by a telephone call with the news that he was nominated for his supporting role in `` Tucker: The Man and His Dream.'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON> was told of her nomination for best actress in `` Dangerous Liaisons'' during filming of `` Immediate Family'' in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. `` I'm deeply gratified by my nomination,'' she said. `` Making ` Dangerous Liaisons' was the best experience of my career.'' Both `` Dangerous Liaisons'' and `` Mississippi Burning'' drew seven nominations, despite criticism of the latter film for rewriting the history of the civil rights movement. The two movies were named for best picture, as were `` The Accidental Tourist'' and `` Working Girl.'' `` Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' collected six nominations, as did `` Working Girl,'' including best original song for <PERSON> Carly </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s `` Let The River Run. <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> said she did n't expect her `` Working Girl'' nomination and slept through the nationally televised Academy Award announcement. She was awakened by her publicist <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Mintz </PERSON>. `` I'm the happiest I've ever been in my whole life,'' the actress said. `` I am extremely grateful to God.'' <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackman </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to film `` The Package,'' said he was awakened at his hotel room with news of his best actor nomination for `` Mississippi Burning.'' `` It feels good,'' he said during an appearance at <ORGANIZATION> DePaul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` When you're given a good part, you have to do something with it.''

<HEAD>Defendant In Alleged Mass Child Molestation Trial Freed On Bail</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, one of two remaining defendants in the McMartin Preschool child molestation trial, expressed concern about threats and criticized news coverage of his case after being freed on $ 1.5 million bail. <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, 30, refused to talk to a crowd of reporters Wednesday as he left a downtown jail with his attorney, <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. They climbed into a <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> and drove to a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> restaurant, where <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON> was interviewed by television station <ORGANIZATION> KABC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, who spent more than five years in jail, said he was worried about threats against him, his attorneys and his family. `` I still realize there are people out there, that as far as I'm concerned, have gone off the deep end,'' he said He further derided news coverage, saying reporters had flocked to the trial's prosecution phase but few journalists have been attending while the defense is presenting its case. `` It's discouraging to think that they wo n't come to hear what we have to say, but they'll come and make a mob scene at my getting out on bail,'' he said. <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON> said he has been in jail so long that `` I do n't remember emotional feelings that everybody out there takes for granted. I've been isolated in a nightmare ...'' He and his mother, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> McMartin </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, 61, face 65 child molestation and conspiracy counts stemming from alleged sexual attacks at the family-run preschool. She has been free on bail since 1987. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Pounders </PERSON> on Friday ordered <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON> freed, although his release was delayed by paperwork involving the real estate that had been pledged for bail. <PERSON> Pounders </PERSON> said he wanted <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>'s long pretrial incarceration to end as soon as possible, but he also set several conditions for <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>. The defendant was ordered to have no contact with the alleged victims in the case, to stay away from the seaside area southwest of downtown where the school had operated, and to turn over his passport and remain under 24-hour security protection. <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON> also was prohibited from coming in contact with anyone younger than 14 and from drinking alcohol. Family friends, as well as <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and co-counsel <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Gits </PERSON>, arranged for <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>'s bail by pledging title to real estate properties worth twice the required bail of $ 1.5 million. The case drew national attention when it broke in 1984 with allegations of nursery school children being raped, sodomized, then terrorized into silence by satanic rites and animal mutilations by teachers.

<TEXT>
 Comedian <PERSON> Gilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Radner </PERSON>, an original `` Saturday Night Live'' cast member who successfully battled ovarian cancer, underwent surgery to correct complications of cancer treatment, a hospital spokesman said. Miss <PERSON> Radner </PERSON>, 42, was listed in fair condition after the surgery Wednesday at <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said hospital spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON>. Her comic-actor husband <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, 53, was with her in the hospital, <PERSON> Wise </PERSON> said. Wise called the surgery routine and said it corrected complications stemming from cancer treatment Miss <PERSON> Radner </PERSON> had last year. He declined to give precise information about the complications or the treatment. `` The surgery definitely was n't related to any malignancies,'' Wise said. `` Her physicians wanted her to wait until she was feeling good and was strong enough. She's planning a book tour soon, so she decided to have it done before the tour.'' Miss <PERSON> Radner </PERSON> was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 1986 and underwent nine months of chemotherapy. She also had radiation therapy and other cancer treatments including surgery. The treatments proved successful and Miss <PERSON> Radner </PERSON> told a Life magazine interviewer in 1988 that `` cancer is about the most unfunny thing in the world. But it does n't mean you have to die.'' Wise said Miss <PERSON> Radner </PERSON> should be released from the hospital next week. The actress was expected to launch her book titled `` It's Always Something'' after her recovery

 Navajo Chairman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> ignored shouted demands for a vote and halted a tribal council meeting on whether he should go on leave in the wake of corruption allegations. The meeting Wednesday included more than eight hours of discussion on whether temporary replacements should be named for <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> and Vice Chairman <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, but <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> ordered the meeting recessed until today. As <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> walked out of the meeting room, some council members yelled `` We want to vote!'' Afterward, about 50 council members went behind closed doors to discuss the situation. A spokesman for the group, Councilman <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> `` Chilli'' <PERSON> Yazzie </PERSON>, said <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> supporters and opponents would try to reach a compromise today. `` We need to get <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> to step aside,'' <PERSON> Yazzie </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> has not been implicated in any wrongdoing. The tribe on Tuesday began its annual winter meeting, which usually lasts five to seven days.

 The federal government will act soon to reduce long lines of immigrants at a processing center in south <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the government's top immigration official in the area said. One possibility is detention. `` Something's got to be done to stop people from abusing the asylum process,'' said <PERSON> Omer </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sewell </PERSON>, director for the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>, where more than 100,000 <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> immigrants are expected to pass through this year. More than 1,000 Central Americans, primarily from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, formed a half-mile-long line Wednesday to apply for political asylum at the new <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> processing location at the agency's remote rural detention center southeast of <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> It was their first chance to file for political amnesty since the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> processing center in <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> was closed Friday because of alleged health and fire code violations. <PERSON> Sewell </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials contend that many seeking asylum are here only to better themselves economically and use the asylum process and lengthy appeals to get into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Political asylum is granted only to those fleeing persecution for political or other reasons. `` I'm waiting for more direction from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and I think there's going to be some action taken to relieve this problem,'' <PERSON> Sewell </PERSON> said while taking a look at the line of immigrants outside the minimum-security, 347-acre <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Isabel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Processing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. He declined to reveal what that action might be. <PERSON> Sewell </PERSON> said Tuesday that detention for the asylum-seekers while their cases are under review is one alternative being considered. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>' regional public affairs director, repeated Wednesday that a detention camp remains a possibility. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> detention center is in eastern <LOCATION> Cameron </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> near the unincorporated community of <LOCATION> Bayview </LOCATION>, just south of the <ORGANIZATION> Laguna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atascosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> and 15 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Filemon </PERSON> <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> has said he would rule by Monday on whether the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> can resume a policy of requiring asylum-seekers to stay in southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> while their cases are reviewed. The judge on Jan. 9 issued a temporary restraining order forcing the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> to allow them to travel to their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> destinations after checking in with the agency's <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> has said he probably would allow the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> to resume the no-travel policy for all asylum-seekers after the restraining order expires Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> originally began the travel restriction to relieve huge backlogs of thousands of asylum cases in cities such as <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>.

 Attorneys for the Beatles and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> have sued to stop a video distributor from selling videocassettes featuring the Fab Four. The federal lawsuit alleges that <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wholesalers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> illegally distributed and sold several Beatles videocassettes, including `` The Beatles at <LOCATION> Shea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION>,'' `` The Beatles in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>,'' `` Beatles Concert in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>'' and `` The Beatles in The Magical Mystery Tour.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> owns the copyright to most Beatles songs. After the lawsuit was filed Wednesday, attorneys for Video Wholesalers agreed to halt sale of the videotapes until the matter is resolved in a hearing March 3 before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. `` This case is of great importance because it is the first time that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and the Beatles have come together to police the valuable Beatles material in which they each have substantial interests,'' said their attorney, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marks </PERSON>. `` This lawsuit sends bootleggers and pirates of Beatles materials the clear message that they will be sued for damages and stopped in their tracks.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Saka </PERSON>, a director for Video Wholesalers, denied that his company is doing anything illegal. `` We have complete rights for what we are doing,'' <PERSON> Saka </PERSON> said. `` We sell prerecorded videocassettes that are made by other people, and made legally. They have not litigated against the manufacturers. We've looked into it, and everything is in order.'' <PERSON> Saka </PERSON> said the sale of the videotapes is not restricted by copyright laws. <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Hough </PERSON>, <PERSON> Saka </PERSON>'s attorney, said the agreement to temporarily stop sales of the videotape `` is in no way an admission of guilt.'' The complaint, filed by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and three Beatles-owned concerns, <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Films </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Subafilms </PERSON>, alleges that Video Wholesalers illegally made and sold the videocassettes without authorization. It charges that the company violated federal copyright laws. Attorneys for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and the Beatles are seeking to bar the firm permanently from selling the videocassettes. They said they also will ask for financial damages.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Find No Police Wrongdoing in Drug Suspect's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rock and bottle throwing by bystanders may have contributed indirectly to a drug suspect's death, a prosecutor said after eight police officers were cleared of wrongdoing in the case. `` It's only common sense to think that if he received treatment sooner, the outcome might have been different,'' Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Skye </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Skye </PERSON>'s office announced that an investigation had determined that the death of <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, 40, was accidental and that there was no criminal wrongdoing or negligence on the part of eight officers involved in a violent scuffle on Feb. 1. Authorities said it took all eight officers to subdue the 6-foot-3, 300-pound Price following a drug purchase by undercover agents in <LOCATION> College </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, a predominantly black housing development. The arrest triggered two days of sporadic street violence in the neighborhood. Price, an ex-convict from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, was hogtied and placed face down in the back seat of a police cruiser after rock and bottle throwing erupted, authorities said. Police drove Price to a school parking lot a couple of blocks away so paramedics could tend him out of the path of flying debris. The medical examiner's office said the restraint following the exertion of the struggle was partly responsible for Price's death. `` By being placed in a limited space with the head face down into the back seat ... -LRB- and -RRB- being handcuffed and restrained, the necessary conditions for producing an asphyxial death existed,'' Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Diggs </PERSON>, associate <PERSON> Hillsborough </PERSON> medical examiner, said in a report released Friday. Police Chief <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McLane </PERSON> defended his officers, saying they properly restrained Price with handcuffs and leg ropes. <PERSON> McLane </PERSON> said he was not surprised that no charges were filed. A police department internal review of the officers' actions has not been completed and is not expected for a couple of weeks.

<HEAD>Consumer Reports Finds Some Condoms Wanting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Consumer Reports called two popular models of latex condoms `` grossly defective,'' provoking an angry reply from the manufacturer which accused the magazine of flawed testing and a misunderstanding of the product. Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports, said Wednesday its testing of 16,000 condoms showed that six other models were less reliable than desired. The tests involved filling some condoms with water and then checking for leaks, and inflating others with air until they burst. All passed government standards in the leakage test. But two models _ LifeStyles Extra Strength with Nonoxynol-9 and LifeStyles Nuda Plus _ had a projected failure rate of 10 percent in the inflation test, poor enough for the magazine to rate them defective. The government does not use that test. <ORGANIZATION> Ansell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Dothan </LOCATION>, Ala.-maker of LifeStyles condoms, objected to the methods used in the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> study, which was published in the magazine's March issue. `` We're mad,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Capozzi </PERSON>. `` We think it's a bad study.'' In a statement, the New York-based company said the magazine reported on products that were voluntarily recalled, tested too few samples of each product and otherwise used flawed testing procedures. `` Clearly, Consumer Reports does not understand condoms,'' it said. <PERSON> Ansell </PERSON> voluntarily recalled 6 million LifeStyles Extra Strength with Nonoxynol-9 condoms last year, Consumer Reports noted. It said most of those it tested were from the recalled lots, and it had no data on subsequent lots. It said there was no recall of the LifeStyles Nuda Plus line. <PERSON> Ansell </PERSON> President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> said, `` We are shocked that Consumer Reports would report negative test results on a product they knew <PERSON> Ansell </PERSON> had voluntarily recalled six months ago. `` Consumer Reports knew their information was out of date, they knew their research was flawed and they published it anyway. We fully expect them to withdraw this erroneous report and redo the study,'' he added. Six other models had a projected failure rate of 4 percent in the inflation test, which the magazine called `` higher than we'd prefer to see.'' They were Sheik Non-Lubricated Plain End, Ramses Sensitol Lubricated, Pleaser Ribbed Lubricated -LRB- now called Saxon Ribbed Lubricated -RRB-, <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> NuFORM, Mentor and LifeStyles Nuda. Samples of 32 other models were ranked in the most-durable category, the magazine reported. They broke very rarely and thus were more likely to prevent pregnancy and the spread of disease, it said. The <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> tests condoms for water leakage but does not use the inflation test. While it does not rate condoms and did not endorse the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> study, `` basically, we have no disagreements or problems with the study,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>. The 32 models in the study's strongest category had a projected failure rate of 1.5 percent. Top-rated for strength were Gold Circle Coin and LifeStyles Extra Strength Lubricated. Both were thicker than others. Skin condoms, made from sheep intestine rather than latex, are stronger than many rubber condoms, Consumer Reports said. However, it said evidence was not conclusive that skin condoms block passage of some viruses, and said its medical consultants advised using latex condoms to prevent disease. The magazine included general advice for the use of latex condoms, warning, for example that oil-based lubricants _ such as <ORGANIZATION> Vaseline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crisco </ORGANIZATION> _ break down the rubber and should not be used. It recommended water-based lubricants such as K-Y Lubricating Jelly and Today Personal Lubricant.

<HEAD>Astronomer Concedes Mistake On Key Piece of Evidence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VALERIE MEEHAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An astronomer who contends Adm. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> faked his claim that he reached the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pole </LOCATION> in 1909 conceded today that he misread a key piece of evidence. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rawlins </PERSON>, however, said he still believes a preponderance of evidence indicates that <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> never reached the pole and knew it. The <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> astronomer said an investigative team commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> was right in saying he had misinterpreted a page of handwritten calculations by <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>, but said its interpretation also was off. Early this month, <ORGANIZATION> Navigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, whose organization the society hired to look into the <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> controversy, announced that a worksheet <PERSON> Rawlins </PERSON> thought held compass calculations actually showed time readings. <PERSON> Rawlins </PERSON>, who argued in a 1970 article and a 1973 book that <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> had been off course, went further last October. He said the worksheet he had found among <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s papers at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> contained navigational notes proving the explorer was 121 miles away from the pole when <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> gave up his quest. In his book, `` <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> at the North Pole: Fact or Fiction?'' <PERSON> Rawlins </PERSON> said <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> never got closer than 100 miles to his goal. The astronomer said today he still believes <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> was about that far off the mark. The disputed document was in an envelope that <PERSON> Peary </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Jo </PERSON>, had labeled as her husband's observations at the time in 1909 when he claimed to have been at the pole. <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> rear admiral, said this month that three experts had examined the document and determined the calculations were made not in 1909, but three years earlier when <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> was about to set off on his 1906 try for the pole. <PERSON> Rawlins </PERSON> said today that <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>' interpretation of the time readings was incorrect and that they are the readings <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> made on March 3, 1900, in <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> just before he set out to round the arctic island's tip. `` It's a part of his greatest legitimate trip,'' <PERSON> Rawlins </PERSON> said. The astronomer said <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> had reportedly told his wife the sheet was his most precious possession and that it is likely <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> was most proud of his <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> trip because it was never questioned. There are other pieces of evidence that indicate <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> did not reach the pole, <PERSON> Rawlins </PERSON> said. He pointed out that the explorer did not bring back such normal records as readings of longitude and compass variations. <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> said in an interview published today in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Rawlins </PERSON> could be right and that his group's interpretation was tentative. `` We have n't seen his numbers yet, but we'll want to look at them,'' <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Son Charged In Death Of Civil Rights Activist</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The son of a longtime civil rights activist was charged with murder after he admitted stabbing his father to death, police said. <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, 24, walked into the Seventh District police station Wednesday afternoon, handed over a bloody butcher knife and told officers he had just killed his father, <PERSON> Ivory </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, police said. `` He had the knife in his hand and laid it on the counter. He said, ` I just murdered my dad,''' Officer <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mae </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. Minutes later, police found <PERSON> Ivory </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, 58, at his home. He had been stabbed three times in the chest and once in the right side. He died later at a hospital. The younger <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, said to have a history of mental illness, was charged Wednesday with first-degree murder and armed criminal action, police said. He was held in the police headquarters jail Wednesday night. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> had appeared calm and had blood on his clothing when he surrendered. She said she asked him why he had killed his father, and he replied: `` I could n't take it anymore. He said he did n't care if I committed suicide, so I stabbed him.'' The elder <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> had been active in civil rights in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> for many years and often had been involved in protest demonstrations. He was a Democratic precinct captain for many years and was vying to become an alderman. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipsitz </PERSON>, the author of a recent biography about <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, called him `` an ordinary person who did extraordinary things.'' <PERSON> Lipsitz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> had paid `` extraordinary penalties'' for his 30 to 35 years of activism, including the dissolution of his marriage. <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> led efforts against substandard housing and utility rate increases and crusaded for employment and public accommodations for blacks. He also was instrumental in getting City Hall to pass legislation providing treatment for the victims of lead-based paint.

<HEAD>Six Injured When Student Radicals Attack U.S. Cultural Center</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Shouting `` Oppose <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit!'', several hundred radical students attacked a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cultural center with firebombs and steel pipes today and at least six policemen were hurt, officials said. It was the third time the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> center in downtown <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> had been attacked by radicals in less than a month. Witnesses said 200 to 300 students stormed the center's compound and briefly occupied its courtyard, smashing windows and tossing firebombs, before being driven away by police firing tear gas. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> reported fire damage to some furniture and fixtures in the center's main building, which houses a public library and distributes information about the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Embassy officials said about 20 students scaled a wall around the compound and forced their way into the building, but no staff members inside were hurt. `` Drive out <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>!'' and `` Oppose <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit!'' witnesses quoted the protesters as shouting. <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, an opposition stronghold, is 180 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, where President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is to stop over on Feb. 27 on his way back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after attending Japanese Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s funeral and visiting <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> The attack came despite a warning by the government that any violence in anti-government protests would be strongly opposed. After about 15,000 militant farmers rioted in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on Monday, burning cars and buildings, President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> chided police for not taking a strong stand on violence, saying, `` I have endured enough.'' The <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> cultural center is a favored attack site for radical students. Radicals have attacked the center 28 times since 1980 _ six times last year. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> McLoughlin </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> cultural center, was quoted as telling local reporters that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may move the center to an outlying area of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> to protect its facility and staff. Several weeks ago, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said it was considering closing the center because of the repeated attacks and concern for the safety of its staff. A spokesman for the students, all from <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Chonnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, demanded in a telephone interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cancel the <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> trip. He said the visit is designed to bolster eroding support for the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must stop meddling in our affairs and close its cultural center here,'' he said. On Wednesday, groups of 100 to 200 radical students set fire to two police substations and fought running street battles with riot police in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> to oppose <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s visit to the city. Anti-government and anti-U.S. sentiment is relatively high in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> because of the bloody military suppression of a pro-democracy civil uprising there in 1980. By official count, about 200 people were killed in the uprising, but dissident groups claim the toll was much higher. Many opposition and dissident figures claim the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> shared responsibility for the bloodbath in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> by condoning the government's plan to quell the uprising. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has denied the charge. In leaflets scattered around the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> cultural center, students also demanded the fall of <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s government and an end to annual U.S.-South Korean joint military exercises. Dissidents have claimed the exercises, named `` Team Spirit,'' are blocking dialogue with Communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.

 A respected alderman withdrew from the Democratic mayoral primary in a move that could tighten the already narrowing race between Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> and State's Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>. `` I would say right now this is a dead heat,'' <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> said shortly after <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> announced his withdrawal Wednesday. <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>, a South Side alderman who campaigned on the theme of racial unity, said it had become clear he lacked the money to finance a competitive campaign for the Feb. 28 primary. He said he would campaign for <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> said he was n't surprised by <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>'s withdrawal or his endorsement of <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, who was elected acting mayor by the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in December 1987 shortly after <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, the city's first black mayor, died <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, the son of the late Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, said he expects to get half of the votes that would have gone to Bloom. However, polls have indicated that most of <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>'s supporters considered <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> their second choice. A Daily Southtown Economist-WBBM-TV poll taken last week showed <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> supported by 43 percent of those surveyed, <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> by 33 percent and <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> by 11 percent. Twelve percent expressed no preference. The 10 percentage points between <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> marks a narrowing of <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s 14-point edge a month earlier. The poll, which has a margin of error of 4 percentage points, shows a virtual dead heat if a rumored write-in campaign on the Republican ticket for former <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> were to materialize. The survey indicates <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> would draw enough votes away from <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> to give the state's attorney a 1 percentage point lead over <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, 39 percent to 38 percent, a lead rendered meaningless by the poll's margin of error. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Horist </PERSON> said the mayor can expect to get the vast majority of the <ORGANIZATION> Bloom </ORGANIZATION> vote, particularly with <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> and his staff joining the <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> campaign. `` Bloom is a very respected alderman,'' said <PERSON> Horist </PERSON>. `` He's going to have an influence with both the undecided voters and those who might be leaning to <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> but who might be soft.'' <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s staff contends otherwise. <PERSON> Marj </PERSON> <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the county prosecutor, said she doubts <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>'s endorsement will mean much because he has been sympathetic toward <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> all along. Nonetheless, she said, <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> sees the race getting tighter in the remaining week and a half. <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>'s withdrawal came a day after financial campaign statements were filed showing he had raised $ 228,000, compared with about $ 3 million for each of the two other major candidates. The alderman had said throughout the campaign that he was in the race to stay, though he hedged by reserving the right to change his mind. The winner of the primary will take on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate and <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a third-party candidate, in the April 4 general election to complete the last two years of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s second term

<HEAD>Pontiac School District Discontinuing `Timeout Boxes'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PONTIAC, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A watchdog group that criticized the use of `` timeout boxes'' to punish unruly special-education students says a decision to end their use is a step in the right direction but more needs to be done. <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall-Bolden </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> Champaign </LOCATION>, Ill.-based <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advocacy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said officials of <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION>'s elementary school district still plan to use such discipline by isolating pupils in small rooms. `` I'd like to see the school district look at other alternatives besides timeout,'' she said. School Superintendent <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Krula </PERSON> said Wednesday that use of the boxes to contain unruly students for brief periods has been `` regrettably discontinued.'' `` The booths have played a very important and necessary role'' but they will no longer be used because of `` misinterpretations and reactions,'' he said. The boxes, which were in place at three schools, were constructed for timeouts because of limited classroom space, school officials said. Without the boxes, the district will have to use small rooms at <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pontiac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Krula </PERSON> said. When students with behavioral disorders at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> schools need to calm down, they will be tranported to schools with timeout space, he said. The boxes, which measure 3 feet by 3 feet and stand about 7 feet tall, have been used in the district in this central Illinois town of 11,000 people, for the past two years. The practice drew attention last month when a 12-year-old boy broke out of the wooden box made by a janitor at <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. His parents complained about his confinement to Protection and Advocacy, which fights for the rights of the mentally ill and disabled. Some parents threatened legal action, and The Daily Leader newspaper here editorialized against the boxes, saying they should not be used under any circumstances. School district officials have defended the boxes as a time-honored way in which to handle youngsters without corporal punishment. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> sent an official to <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> to review the boxes and a report is expected this week on their appropriateness as a disciplinary measure. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rapp </PERSON>, the district's special-education supervisor, said last week the punishment was limited to three pupils, ages 10 to 12, who were seen as a threat to teachers or other children and were classified as behavior disorder cases by a psychologist. Timeouts are used only for students with behavioral disorders who have shown `` consistently uncontrollable, aggressive behavior such as swearing or hitting teachers,'' he said. Students were put into the boxes only after a series of other disciplinary steps brought no results, <PERSON> Rapp </PERSON> said. The box was used only as a last resort for up to 15 minutes and with a teacher or teacher's aide present at all times, he said.

 Big dreams fueled big lottery sales throughout <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> as players took their chances on a $ 17 million jackpot in today's drawing, the largest in state history. `` I'd quit work,'' said one woman buying a ticket at the <ORGANIZATION> Middlesex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mart </ORGANIZATION> in the northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> borough of <LOCATION> Middlesex </LOCATION>. `` I'd just relax,'' said another. `` I'd squander it all in one day,'' said a third. The lure of the record jackpot did n't create lines at most lottery outlets, but shop owners said business was brisk. Lottery spokeswoman <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Southard </PERSON> said lottery sales usually average about $ 2.5 million to $ 3 million for each Pick-6 drawing, and there were only $ 1.3 million in sales last week when the jackpot was at $ 6 million. But when the jackpot reached $ 12 million Monday, there were $ 9.5 million in lottery tickets sold. The estimated jackpot for today is the result of six consecutive Pick-6 drawings without a top prize winner. The jackpot also was fueled by a big change in the odds made last month when lottery officials increased the choice of numbers from 42 to 46. Previously, the odds of hitting the jackpot were about one in 5.2 million, but with the added numbers the odds of picking all six numbers are one in 9.3 million. `` I guess everybody's dreaming about what they could do with $ 17 million,'' said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvo </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> driver from <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION> who's been hearing about the lottery at every stop. `` I try not to think about it too much because it can consume you,'' he added. But <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Korolenko </PERSON>, a produce truck driver, has spent plenty of time thinking about the lottery. <PERSON> Korolenko </PERSON>, 31, said he's been buying tickets at each store as he makes his rounds. <PERSON> Korolenko </PERSON> is hoping the lottery tickets will give him an opportunity to buy another kind of ticket. `` Sure, that's the way out,'' he said. `` The ticket out of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The author of `` The Satanic Verses'' canceled a planned promotional tour of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> put a $ 2.6 million price on his head. `` The current climate is not appropriate for a promotional tour of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>,'' said a statement issued Wednesday by the book's publisher, <ORGANIZATION> Viking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penguin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Viking </PERSON> <PERSON> Penguin </PERSON> had scheduled an 11-city <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour for <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, including readings at four The tour was to begin Friday to coincide with the official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> publication of the book on Feb. 11. The book has been available in stores in this country for several weeks. But <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, was reported to have gone into hiding with his wife, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> novelist <PERSON> Marianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON>, following the Iranian threat. Police said seven bomb threats have been made in the past two months to the publisher's <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> offices. The book, banned in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, was described as `` a dirty conspiracy'' against <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> by the Iranian government. Six people died earlier this week in protests against the book in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> called for <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s death and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Wednesday offered $ 2.6 million to any Iranian and $ 1 million to any foreigner who killed the author, a Moslem born in <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Slovak </PERSON>, a Viking Penguin spokesman, said recent events in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, `` combined with our understanding of threats made against the author and those associated with'' the book's publication led the publisher to cancel the tour `` We reiterate that no offense was intended in the creation or publication of this work,'' the publisher's statement publisher said. `` It is also our unalterable position that freedom of speech, freedom to publish and freedom to read must be guaranteed internationally,'' it added. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> received support Tuesday from <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION>, which issued a statement saying it supports the right of all authors everywhere to write without fear of constraint from any quarters. `` We are appalled by <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s threats against <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> and his publishers,'' the statement said. <PERSON> Dawud </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Masajid </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, called the book `` garbage'' and said he welcomed the cancellation of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> book tour. But <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> said it was wrong to sentence the author to death. `` Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance,'' he said. `` Who knows what is really in the heart of <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>.'' Muslim leaders in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> reacted similarly. `` I'm shocked by -LRB- <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s -RRB- insensitivity, but I think calls for his murder are absurd, absolutely absurd,'' said <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Abou </PERSON> <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadl </PERSON> of the Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` I am not even in favor of banning the book.

 A jury awarded <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s lover $ 14.5 million _ $ 3.5 million more than he sought _ in a case that appears to increase the legal responsibility of AIDS sufferers to tell sexual companions of their plight. In what one expert called a landmark decision, the jury declared Wednesday that <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> engaged in `` outrageous conduct'' before his death by withholding his AIDS diagnosis from <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> so he could continue their sexual affair. The settlement could go still higher. Jurors were scheduled to return today to hear evidence and consider punitive damages against <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s secretary, who was found to have conspired to keep the late actor's AIDS diagnosis a secret. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s estate and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> were co-defendants in the seven-week trial in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Superior </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION>, where jurors listened to often-lurid testimony about the late star's sex life before deciding in favor of Christian, 35. `` I'm very pleased, very pleased that they -LRB- the jurors -RRB- answered the way they did on all the questions,'' <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> said, adding that the verdict shows `` people have a duty to disclose if they have AIDS to their lovers.'' Aside from <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>'s fame, the case was unusual because <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> apparently was not infected by the AIDS virus in spite of his exposure. It is believed to be the first case of its type in which damages were awarded to a plaintiff who had not developed physical symptoms of AIDS. <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> claimed he was entitled to compensation for the emotional distress of fearing he would get AIDS, a fatal illness that attacks the body's immune system. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, an attorney and author of `` Lovers, Doctors & amp; The Law,'' said the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> case is `` absolutely a landmark'' that will likely encourage other lawsuits by people who are `` deceived by promises in the dark.'' `` The jury is telling <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that you have to make full and complete disclosure if you are aware that you have the disease,'' she said. `` You're going to think twice about it if you know you can face big dollar damages or time in jail.'' A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> expressed ambivalence about the verdict. `` We find it a troubling case because it places the entire burden of safe sex on one individual and not the two,'' said the spokesman, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrow </PERSON>. `` It underscores for us again the need for everyone who engages in sexual activity to take responsibility for themselves as well as for their partners.'' Attorneys in the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> case, who are under a gag order, would not comment on any aspect of the verdict, including how the judgment will be apportioned or if the defendants will appeal as expected. Appeals courts have often reduced huge awards in civil cases. Attorneys for the estate attempted to portray <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> as a gigolo whose relationship with <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> had ended when the actor learned he had the disease. They said repeated medical tests showed that <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> had not been infected by the AIDS virus. Christian's attorney pointed to sentimental love letters from <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> to buttress the claim that theirs was a serious affair of the heart. `` I love you, my baby,'' said one of the missives. Although he shared <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s bed for two years, the aspiring musician said he did n't learn the actor had AIDS until it was announced to the world shortly before <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> died in October 1985 at age 58. `` I thought I was a dead man,'' <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> testified of his reaction to the news. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, the handsome <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> leading man paired on screen and television with <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, kept his homosexuality a closely guarded secret until his battle with AIDS became public knowledge. In a complicated verdict questionnaire, the jury answered `` Yes'' to the question: `` <LOCATION> Did </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> engage in outrageous conduct?'' Jurors gave the same response regarding <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. Christian smiled happily as the verdict was read. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s secretary and best friend, did n't react visibly to the verdict. He alone is subject to possible punitive damages for his actions in helping <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> keep his secret. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said he abided by <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s wishes because he was a friend, but also because he thought the affair between the two lovers had ended. The jury thought otherwise. To the question, `` After <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> knew that <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> had AIDS, did <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> know that plaintiff and <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> were having sexual relations of a type that put plaintiff at risk of acquiring AIDS?'' the panel answered, `` Yes.'' Asked whether <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> kept the actor's secret `` to induce plaintiff to have high-risk sexual relations with <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>,'' jurors also answered, `` Yes.'' The 12 jurors' answers to the 37 questions were not always unanimous, but in civil trials, only a majority of nine is needed to reach a verdict on each question. They were unanimous on 23 decisions, all favoring <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was a chief beneficiary of <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s estate, the value of which was not disclosed in the actor's will when it was filed in November 1985.

<HEAD>Bank Officials Re-Evaluate Automatic Tellers After Theft Scheme Discovered</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A foiled scheme to steal $ 14 million from automated teller machines has sparked concerns about the vulnerability of the systems, particularly when an insider is involved, officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents raided an apartment here 12 days ago and broke up what the government described as a ring created by a 28-year-old computer programmer designed to obtain cash from thousands of <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> accounts. `` There has never been an attempt like this in the history of shared ATMs,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Plus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest automatic teller machine network and one of the aborted scheme's targets. `` We can certainly learn a lot from it.'' `` I think the potential there should be very scary for the networks,'' said <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. ATM use has grown dramatically over the past 10 years as a means for bank customers to access their accounts 24 hours a day. There are more than 72,000 ATMs nationwide, and Plus Systems alone links 25,000 of the machines. ATM crimes have been considered minor, usually involving people being robbed after taking money out of the machines or small thefts by employees. But a study by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, an industry research organization, found that losses in 1986 nationwide were $ 40 million. According to industry officials, the sophistication of the criminals has increased as the number of ATMS has grown. Nearly $ 350,000 was stolen from <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in October when a special card was used to steal cash from 300 customer accounts. That theft is the largest reported ATM crime. But that figure seems small compared to the $ 7 million to $ 14 million that could have been stolen in the latest scheme, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kubota </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Koenig </PERSON>, who had been a temporary contract employee for <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, is accused of divising a plan to make 7,400 counterfeit ATM cards. In his programming job he had access to secret ATM codes at dozens of banks. His wife, sister, brother and another person also were arrested. The foiled <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> attempt has prompted Plus Systems to plan new steps to ensure that contractors comply with procedures to protect secret account information, <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> said. `` If the security standards are implemented and enforced, there should not be any security breach,'' he said. `` We are now evaluating ways in which we can verify the enforcement of our regulations.''

 A man who ran over a beloved neighborhood duck has been ordered to do time at an animal farm, buy a replacement duck for the owners and train it to cross the road. Dozens of people sent cards, letters and flowers to <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Spak </PERSON> after <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> the Duck's death Jan. 23. <PERSON> Danny </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Pekin </LOCATION> duck about 9 or 10 years old, was a familiar sight to area residents during his frequent jaunts across the road to swim in a creek next to the fire station, his owners said. `` When they'd walk their dogs, they'd stop and talk to him,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Spak </PERSON> said. `` Everybody sure did love the duck.'' Mayor <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrnfelt </PERSON> said he threw the book at <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Yarsky </PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION> Strongsville </LOCATION>, who pleaded no contest to a second-degree misdemeanor charge of killing an animal Feb. 9. `` He said he did n't intentionally run the duck over,'' <PERSON> Ehrnfelt </PERSON> said Tuesday. The mayor said <PERSON> Yarsky </PERSON>'s lack of remorse during the court appearance made him think `` it was a deliberate act.'' <PERSON> Yarsky </PERSON> was caught because a witness copied down his license number and reported it to police, <PERSON> Ehrnfelt </PERSON> said. Ehrnfelt fined Yarsky $ 750 plus $ 28 in court costs and 90 days in jail. `` I suspended the 90 days based on the fact that maybe we could help this individual learn a little bit about animals and the love of pets,'' the mayor said. To avoid jail time, <PERSON> Yarsky </PERSON> has to read a book on ducks and spend two days a week for the next two months as a volunteer at the <ORGANIZATION> Burnette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> in Olmsted Township. <PERSON> Ehrnfelt </PERSON> also ordered <PERSON> Yarsky </PERSON> to buy the Spaks another duck and train it, including how to cross the road to the creek. `` I even said I would help him if necessary,'' <PERSON> Ehrnfelt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Yarsky </PERSON> was not at home when telephoned for comment this morning. His mother, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON>, reiterated his claim that the death was an accident.

 President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s party retained its majority in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, the government announced today, in an election marred by ethnic violence that left more than 1,000 people dead. The president's <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> captured 125 of the 225 parliamentary seats, government officials announced. But it was thwarted in its efforts to win complete control of the body with a two-thirds majority. The governing party had held 139 of the 168 seats in the outgoing <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. The ballot-counting from Wednesday's election took place under a 21-hour nationwide curfew. Civilian movement was banned earlier today in an effort to prevent more killings by Sinhalese extremists and Tamil guerrillas. Shortly before the curfew began this morning, Sinhalese militants shot and killed five soldiers and wounded four policemen in attacks on army and police posts in southern and central <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, police said. At least 56 people were killed in ethnic violence on election day, police said. About 1,000 others were slain during the five-week campaign. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s party won 110 seats in direct popular balloting and 15 more under a formula calculated on the nationwide percentage, the officials said. However, the opposition, led by the <ORGANIZATION> Sri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of former Prime Minister <PERSON> Sirmavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON>, prevented the party of the 64-year-old president from winning the two-thirds majority it wanted. Such a victory would have assured the president of sufficient power to amend the constitution and push through measures aimed at stopping the ethnic unrest in this <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island. The <ORGANIZATION> Sri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had eight and the rest were shared by smaller parties and unattached members in the outgoing <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Officials said the president planned an ambitious anti-poverty program for his 16 million people and to bring an end to the ethnic violence which has claimed more than 10,000 lives since 1983. Mrs. <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON>'s party captured 67 seats, and Tamil candidates got 23, according to the official returns. The Tamil winners included 12 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, formerly one of the underground rebel groups fighting for an independent homeland. An alliance of three leftist parties won three seats, and smaller parties and independents took the rest. As the results were being announced over state-run television and radio, troops and policemen fanned out across the nation to enforce the curfew, setting up road blocks in the capital. Hundreds of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> residents crowded groceries and pharmacies to stock up on essential goods after curfew hours were announced on television this morning. The curfew was to remain in force until at least 6 a.m. Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> held 139 of the 168 seats in the outgoing <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Sri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had eight and the rest were shared by smaller parties and unattached members. The violence of recent years was sparked by a campaign by minority Tamils for an independent homeland. At least 8,500 people have been killed in the separatist war, and another 1,500 killed in a Sinhalese backlash. Militants among the Sinhalese accuse the government of granting too many concessions to the Tamils under a 1987 peace accord aimed at ending the bloody separatist war. The peace pact failed after the most powerful of the Tamil radical groups, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION> rejected it. Tamils make up 18 percent of the people. The Sinhalese account for about 75 percent. Militant Tamils claim they are discriminated by the Sinhalese in government jobs, the army and education.

 A debt collector who fatally shot three co-workers at a savings and loan bank before killing himself had spent two years in a mental hospital after allegedly asking a police officer to shoot him, a state health official says. <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON>, 33, of Silver Spring, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, argued with a supervisor Wednesday, left work and returned with .38 - caliber revolver concealed in an athletic bag, police A fourth employee was shot in the jaw, police said. <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, had been a collector reportedly since October in the Visa card department of the <ORGANIZATION> Chevy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in this <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suburb. The shootings began in the seventh-floor office where he worked _ a large room in which about 75 employees are grouped and separated by six-foot partitions. Officer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludington </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police, said <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> was a `` disgruntled employee'' but would not elaborate. He said detectives were still piecing together the motive. The <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> had been released in October 1986 after spending about two years at the <ORGANIZATION> Clifton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Perkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a psychiatric facility in <PERSON> Jessup </PERSON>, Md. <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> was sent to the mental hospital after he was ruled criminally insane following his arrest on charges of assaulting a police officer, the spokesman, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Golden </PERSON>, said. `` All of the people that I have talked to about it are very disturbed, very surprised by it ... because all indications were that Mr. <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> was doing very well,'' <PERSON> Golden </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> WUSA </ORGANIZATION>. The station said <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> had originally been arrested after approaching a <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police officer and saying, `` I want to die, kill me,'' and then reaching for the officer's gun. He was charged with attempted murder in that case, according to the television report. A <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police official said late Wednesday the department would not release any details about <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON>'s background. The dead women were identified as: <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Landover </LOCATION>, Md.; <PERSON> Tanya </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Md.; and <PERSON> Mahasty </PERSON> <PERSON> Agha-Khan </PERSON>, 29, of Silver Spring. <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> also wounded <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 22, of Silver Spring, police said. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who was shot in the jaw, was in critical condition at <LOCATION> Suburban </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> after surgery. `` I was right next to <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> when he shot him first,'' said <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Abellano </PERSON>. `` I dived under my chair.'' Employee <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> had had a fight with a male co-worker last week and that worker might have been the target of his anger. Others said <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> also had had a disagreement Wednesday with his female supervisor, allegedly about a personal phone call. But witnesses said neither of those two people was shot. One of the women who died was killed in the office area, and the other two were shot in a nearby lunch room, <PERSON> Ludington </PERSON> said. `` I had no idea that he would flip,'' said co-worker <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Waters </PERSON>. `` I got along with him pretty well,'' said another co-worker, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hines </PERSON>. `` We went on smoke breaks. From what I hear, the people who worked with him did n't like him.''

 Leaders of the country's largest anti-apartheid groups today renounced <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and accused her young bodyguards of waging a `` reign of terror'' in the black community A group of influential activists accused Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, wife of jailed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, of `` violating human rights ... in the name of the struggle against apartheid.'' It was the first public denunciation of Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> by the senior leadership of the anti-apartheid movement. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and a group of young supporters, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> soccer club, are under investigation in the death of a teen-age black activist who disappeared after allegedly being beaten at Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s home in the <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> township. Police and community leaders say the activist, <PERSON> Stompie </PERSON> <PERSON> Seipei </PERSON>, 14, led a `` children's army'' of 1,500 black children in the Tumahole township of the <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and became a legend in the racial unrest of 1984-87. He was jailed under emergency rules at age 10, the youngest of the thousands detained, and held for 11 months. Two other slayings, one of a <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> member and the other of a prominent anti-apartheid physician, also are being investigated by police as part of the case. The police investigation is the latest in a series of controversies in recent years that have dogged Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. Many black activists used to call her `` Mother of the Nation,'' but Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s erratic behavior and reluctance to coordinate her actions with black leaders have alienated many supporters. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has abused the trust and confidence which she has enjoyed over the years,'' said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Morobe </PERSON>, a spokesman for the banned <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest anti-apartheid group. `` Numerous efforts have been made to reconcile the conflict between Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and the -LRB- black -RRB- community,'' he said. `` On every occasion Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has refused to cooperate and has chosen to disregard the sentiments of the community.'' <LOCATION> Morobe </LOCATION> emphasized that anti-apartheid leaders `` reaffirm our unqualified support for our leader, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, and call for his immediate release.'' <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, the country's best known black leader, has been imprisoned since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white-led government. Joining Morobe at the news conference were other leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, prominent anti-apartheid lawyers, and officials of the militant <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions, the largest black labor federation. <LOCATION> Morobe </LOCATION> noted that Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has faced severe hardships, such as being separated from her husband for 27 years, raising her two daughters alone, living under a series harsh police restictions, and spending 18 months in solitary confinement without charge. `` We pay tribute to her contribution,'' said <LOCATION> Morobe </LOCATION>, adding that it had been a painful decision for black leaders to speak out against Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. But he said her actions repeatedly violated the principles of the anti-apartheid movement. He specifically cited <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> a group of youths who seldom play soccer, but have served as Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s bodyguards since she formed the team in 1986. `` We are outraged by the reign of terror that the team has been associated with,'' <PERSON> Morobe </PERSON> said. `` Not only is Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> associated with the team, in fact, the team is her own creation.'' <LOCATION> Morobe </LOCATION> conceded that the government will use the criticism against Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> as a `` propaganda point.'' <PERSON> Morobe </PERSON> said black leaders did not seek to create a division in the black community and called on people to distance themselves from Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> `` in a dignified manner.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> could not immediately be reached for comment. A woman at Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> office said she was not available. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayob </PERSON>, said he did not think <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> was aware of today's denunciation of his wife. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> on Wednesday after an 80-minute meeting at a prison farm near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> with her husband. After her return, police stopped the van carrying her back to <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> and impounded the vehicle on the highway. While Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, her daughter and granddaughter hitched a ride with a journalist, police took into custody a young man accompanying her, but they later released him. Police Capt. <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloomberg </PERSON> said the van had been seized for investigation into the slaying of <PERSON> Stompie </PERSON>, whose decomposed body was identified in a police morgue Wednesday through fingerprints. `` We are outraged at Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s complicity in the recent abductions and assault of <PERSON> Stompie </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Morobe </PERSON> said. `` Had <PERSON> Stompie </PERSON> and his three colleagues not been abducted by Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s ` football team,' he would have been alive today.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> had no comment about her meeting with her husband or the controversy that has surrounded her since three youths told a community meeting in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> that they had been abducted and taken to her home, where they were beaten. They said <PERSON> Stompie </PERSON> was with them, but had been beaten more severely, and was taken away after a couple of days. The three youths, according to their attorney, said Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> was involved in the events. She has denied being at home at the time, but has defended the abduction, saying the three men and the teen-ager were taken from a <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> residence last month to protect them from sexual abuse. The church has denied the charge.

 A man was convicted of removing nearly 150 trees on national parkland to improve his view of the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> as the jury rejected his claim that hired tree-cutters ignored his instructions. The federal jury deliberated less than three hours Wednesday before finding <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> water bed manufacturer, guilty of felony conversion of government property to his personal use and a misdemeanor charge of illegally removing trees. The tree cutters hacked down scores of oaks, locusts and maples as well as several rarer ironwood and persimmon trees along the <ORGANIZATION> C </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; O Canal and <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> adjacent to <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON>'s property in February 1985. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> set sentencing for April 17. <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON>, 45, faces up to 11 years in prison and $ 350,000 in fines. He remained free on bond pending sentencing. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> contended that <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON> had the trees chopped to improve his view of the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> and to increase the value of his $ 1.1 million home, which he put up for sale but never sold. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON>, who operates <ORGANIZATION> Suburban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in College Park, testified that <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON> said he `` wanted all these trees cut down to the canal'' and that he `` wanted a good view of the river.'' But <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON> countered that <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> had suggested removing trees on the slope that included the park land. He said he insisted that he only wanted trees cut down to his property line.

 Actress <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> and her husband, state Assemblyman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>, will separate after 16 years of marriage that began as a romance between two of the best-known activists of the anti-Vietnam War movement. They have two children, Troy, 15, and <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON>, 20, who is <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>'s daughter from a previous marriage to director <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> The couple have lived in a large home in suburban <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> and on a ranch near <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>. The separation will be on a trial basis, spokesman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> consider this separation a private matter and will have no public comment or statement on it,'' <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> said. Friends said the pair's divergent careers placed a strain on the marriage. <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> himself has joked: `` If <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> and I have an evening at home alone together, it is a scheduling mistake by the staff.'' <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>, 51, who won best-actress Oscars for the 1971 film `` Klute'' and in 1978 for `` Coming Home,'' and <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>, 49, a Democrat representing coastal <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> in the state Assembly, were married in January 1973. In his recently published memoir, `` Reunion,'' <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> offered intimate glimpses of his romance with <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>, who has become best-known in recent years as an exercise guru whose aerobics video tapes are best sellers. `` I have been a lucky man these past fifteen years. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> is many persons _ actress, rebel, fitness expert _ but I love her most as the mother of Troy and <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON> ... Like myself, she loves the fullness of a family life she never had,'' <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>, the radical young co-founder of Students for a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, was one of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Seven defendants acquitted of plotting to incite a riot during the 1968 Democratic convention in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> and four others were convicted of individually trying to promote a riot and he was sentenced to five years in prison, but an appeals court overturned the riot conviction in 1972 and most of the contempt citations were thrown out the next year. <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1972 and was widely criticized for making radio broadcasts urging <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airmen to stop bombing and for taking the seat of an anti-aircraft cannon. Critics called her `` <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> Jane'' and a traitor. Last summer, she went on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> show `` 20-20'' and apologized to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans for the <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> visit but stood by her opposition to the war.

 A mild earthquake rattled an area of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> this morning, but there no reports of damage or injuries, authorities said.

<TEXT>
 Cambodian guerrilla leaders today accused the Cambodian government of entering peace talks with the `` same rigid attitude'' they say has blocked settlement of the 10-year-old conflict. Senior officials of the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government and the three factions of the resistance coalition held a 45-minute session apart from their larger meeting with other Southeast Asian countries. The meeting is aimed at ending the war that began after Soviet-armed <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978. Vietnamese forces since have battled the guerrillas backed by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The resistance coalition issued a statement alleging the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government is engaged only in a public relations exercise and that during the private session it `` maintained the same rigid attitude which is not conducive to a comprehensive settlement of the Kampuchean -LRB- <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> -RRB- problem.'' `` The plan proposed by the other side is tantamount to asking the -LRB- resistance -RRB- to capitulate to a regime installed by foreign forces,'' the statement said. It said a solution was possible only on the basis of a plan proposed by resistance leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>. <PERSON> Phnom </PERSON> <PERSON> Penh </PERSON> rejected that plan even before the talks began. Resistance spokesman <PERSON> Thiounn </PERSON> <PERSON> Prasith </PERSON> read the statement aloud at a news conference after a 10-minute monologue in which he railed against <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and the `` illegal'' Cambodian regime it was `` manipulating.'' He denounced <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> for not allowing international supervision of its troop withdrawal and claimed that about 20,000 Vietnamese soldiers recently have disguised themselves in Cambodian uniforms. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in January said it will end its 10-year military incursion in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by the end of September. <PERSON> Phnom </PERSON> <PERSON> Penh </PERSON>'s representative, <PERSON> Hor </PERSON> <PERSON> Nam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hong </PERSON>, appeared at the same news conference, insisting his side fervently desires a settlement. The organizer of the talks, <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Alatas </PERSON>, said that at the plenary session, the officials discussed the Vietnamese withdrawal, an end to foreign military aid to the guerrillas, and a mechanism for supervision and control of any agreement. The session brought together <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, its ally <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government, the resistance, and the members of <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION>: <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>. A first round of talks, held in July, achieved no breakthroughs but resulted in a consensus that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s withdrawal must be linked to measures preventing the return to power of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, which killed hundreds of thousands of people in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> before <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> toppled it. The communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> is allied in the guerrilla coalition with the forces of <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> and Son <PERSON> Sann </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, widely seen as the central figure in any future Cambodian government, is boycotting the talks because <PERSON> Phnom </PERSON> <PERSON> Penh </PERSON> rejected his peace plan. The plan included calls for dissolution of the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government before a general election; introduction of an international peace-keeping force to guarantee any settlement; and specifics from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on its pledge to withdraw its troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.

 Army troops and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> militiamen exchanged intermittent artillery fire today, jeopardizing a cease-fire in their battle for control of the city's Christian zone. A police spokesman said the 22-hour battle between the two <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> forces, which has killed at least 66 people and wounded 200, also caused `` colossal'' material losses amounting to `` hundreds of millions of dollars.'' `` Many, many houses, shops and even banks have been gutted,'' he said. Gunners of the Lebanese Forces militia and army units were firing sporadically at each other's positions today in the impoverished district of <LOCATION> Ein </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rummaneh </LOCATION> and its surroundings. `` If the exchange escalates, it might shatter the cease-fire,'' said the police spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The leftist newspaper As-Safir called Wednesday's fighting `` the Maronites' black day.'' The army of the Christian-controlled government and the Christian militia are made up mainly of Maronites Catholics. The country is now led by two rival governments, one Christian and the other Moslem. The fighting, which began Tuesday and tapered off with a cease-fire Wednesday, further divided the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> camp in its nearly 14-year-old civil war against the Moslems. An official at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> denied radio reports that Ambassador <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> has decided to evacuate <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> with his entire <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> staff to the east Mediterranean island of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. `` There are no plans for us to leave,'' said the official, who requested anonymity. He said none of the embassy's estimated 20 American staffers had been injured in the fighting, which sent a few shells crashing 200 yards from the embassy compound in suburban <LOCATION> Aukar </LOCATION> and broke windows there. The offices were closed Wednesday and today. In Wednesday's fight, the army overran militia strongholds to control about 75 percent of the Christian enclave, police said. They also said the army took militia positions in a central mountain range.

<HEAD>Republican Party Fights Former Klan Leader's Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>METAIRIE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> have made highly unusual endorsements in a state House race in an effort to defeat a former <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klan </PERSON> leader who is running as a Republican. In radio spots that began running today, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` I ca n't help but tell you of the high regard I have for one candidate in the race for your next representative, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Treen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> faces fellow Republican <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> in Saturday's runoff for a seat in the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, representing a district in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> suburbs. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> was imperial wizard of the Knights of the <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klan </PERSON> until he left the group in 1980. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, described the endorsements by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as unprecedented for a state legislative race. The national party is helping pay the costs and is also assigning three campaign professionals to help <PERSON> Treen </PERSON>, she said. `` <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> will embrace any political party he can get to espouse his politics of hatred, violence and bigotry,'' <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` If he's trying to say that being a racist and a bigot is the same as being a conservative Republican, I beg to differ with him. His background has nothing to do with mainstream <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> values. It's a disgrace.'' Letters signed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, saying that <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> has a `` strong sense of compassion for others and an abiding faith in the future of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' are being mailed to voters this week, <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> said. While neither <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> mention <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> in their endorsements, the national party's interest stems solely from <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s background, she said. <PERSON> Treen </PERSON>, also running as a Republican, finished a distant second to <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> in the seven-way Jan. 21 primary. Under <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s open primary system, the top two vote-getters in a primary, regardless of party, face each other in the runoff if no one candidate gets half the primary votes. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said he is amazed that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> are involved in the local election that involves only about 23,000 registered voters. `` The outside interference in this race is absolutely ridiculous,'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said. `` It's like the establishment is closing the ranks to prevent an independent from coming through.'' <PERSON> Treen </PERSON>, who was state campaign chairman for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 1980 unsuccessful presidential bid, said the endorsements show `` that at the highest levels of government, there is a genuine concern about someone that harbors such a foreign ideology.'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> claims he no longer agrees with the Klan philosophy. He heads a group called the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, which he says is not racist but a group seeking human rights for everybody.

<HEAD>Two Men Indicted for Using Voodoo in Attempt to Murder Circuit Judge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUPELO, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two brothers trying to get a voodoo death curse put on a judge who sentenced one of them to prison paid $ 100 to an undercover agent for a portrait and what they thought was a lock of the judge's hair, officials said. <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> and his brother <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tupelo </LOCATION> were indicted this month on a charge of conspiracy to murder <LOCATION> Lee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. The indictment was made public Monday. In July, <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> had sentenced <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivy </PERSON> to 40 years in prison after Ivy pleaded guilty to two robberies of <LOCATION> Tupelo </LOCATION> liquor stores. From the state penitentiary in <LOCATION> Parchman </LOCATION>, he conspired with his brother to retaliate against the judge, authorities said. `` They tried to kill him with voodoo,'' said <LOCATION> Lee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>. `` We've talked about it. To me, it was kind of a joke.'' <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, an investigator with the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>, said undercover agents discovered that someone was trying to obtain a photo of <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> and a lock of his hair to send to a voodoo practitioner in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> to have a hex placed on the judge. Agents supplied a picture of <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> and a lock of a detective's hair to <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivy </PERSON> last October, he said. The brother paid $ 100 for the hair and photo, <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> said, adding that it was the payment of money that led to the conspiracy charge. They had allegedly agreed to pay $ 1,000 to the voodoo witch doctor, via a middleman in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. Contacted this week, <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> declined to comment. `` I'd rather not discuss it now _ for obvious reasons,'' he said. Voodoo is a West African religious belief that incorporates a number of gods. It is a national religion in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> and is widespread throughout the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and in some communities in the South.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> rejected a request by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to purchase a small <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> bank because it said <PERSON> Continenal </PERSON> had not fulfilled its duties under a law designed to prevent red-lining. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said it found `` important deficiencies'' in the bank's performance under the Community Reinvestment Act, which requires banks to meet local credit needs, including those of low - and moderate-income <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s petition to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Scottsdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, was rejected on a 4-2 vote Wednesday, with Govs. <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> LaWare </PERSON> opposed. Gov. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> did not vote. `` The bank made no significant effort to ascertain the credit needs of its communities or to advertise its products to the community,'' the 10-page majority decision said. `` Finally, given <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s size, as well as the opportunities available in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area, -LRB- the -RRB- bank's participation in community development and redevelopment efforts was unsatisfactory.'' The decision also said the bank made `` substantially inaccurate'' statements for a number of years about its compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. It noted that the bank has since developed a plan that should `` make substantial contribution to correcting the past deficiencies'' in its compliance with the law. But it added: `` The board does not believe that commitments by themselves can serve as a substitute for the established record of <ORGANIZATION> CRA </ORGANIZATION> performance required by the statute.'' The board also voiced concern about the bank's plan to expand while still financed in part by and subject to the control of <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, in the wake of a 1984 federal bailout.

 A 4-year-old Palestinian girl died today of head injuries suffered in a mysterious explosion, and three Palestinians were wounded by army gunfire during protests in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> news reports said. A military source confirmed the girl's death. The army said it was checking the other reported casualties. Since the Palestinian uprising in the occupied lands began 14 months ago, 380 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have been killed. Two aides to Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, the leader of the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, met Wednesday night with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> supporter <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> to lay the groundwork for future peace talks. It was the second meeting this week between <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> legislators and <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, one of the most prominent Palestinian figures in the occupied territories. The meetings were criticized by Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, which accused Labor of violating a coalition agreement that bars <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from holding talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> legislator <PERSON> Reuven </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivlin </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio the meetings were tantamount to holding talks with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. The talks were `` directly with someone who thinks he represents <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Rivlin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Burg </PERSON>, a parliament member and aide to <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> who attended Wednesday's meeting, said the talks were needed to break through psychological barriers between Israelis and Palestinians. `` We can not consider every Palestinian to be a terrorist and not speak to him,'' <PERSON> Burg </PERSON> said on the radio. `` They -LRB- the talks -RRB- are a basis so that one day Israelis will come and say okay so the next stage is a political dialogue,'' he said. The death of 4-year-old <PERSON> Iktimal </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tayasir </LOCATION> village in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> came three days after she was injured when a device she found near her home exploded, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Her 10-year-old brother <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> also was wounded in the blast. The army launched an investigation into the blast in <LOCATION> Tayasir </LOCATION> and into two other Palestinian deaths linked to explosions of unidentified devices on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. The air force also has been asked to look into the blasts. <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists have charged that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers have thrown explosive devices out of jeeps to lure unsuspecting children, but the army has denied the reports. The army's deputy chief of staff, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Barak </PERSON>, says the blasts generally have resulted from children playing with undetonated shells near firing ranges or with flares that fell from training jets. The two earlier blasts killed a 15-year-old near the village of <LOCATION> Kabatiya </LOCATION> on Monday and an 8-year-old in the village of <LOCATION> Tamoun </LOCATION> on Feb. 4. The army said the <LOCATION> Kabatiya </LOCATION> incidents occurred after the teen-ager wandered onto an army training ground. An army spokeswoman said the military planned to take measures to prevent such accidents in the future, but she did not elaborate. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> today, teen-agers staged several stone-throwing protests, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The reports said three youths, aged 12, 14, and 17, were shot in the legs by soldiers.

Air-traffic controllers in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Terminal Radar Facility at the time of the incident said the planes flew within 1 -LCB- miles horizontally and 200 feet vertically of each other. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> regulations mandate that planes be kept at least three miles apart horizontally and 1,000 feet vertically. Controllers, whose identities were withheld because of a pending investigation, told the newspaper that a controller in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> spotted the potential collision just after 7 p.m. and quickly warned the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jet to turn. Controllers said the planes, which were flying at about 300 mph, would have collided in about 15 seconds. `` There is an investigation for a possible -LRB- controller -RRB- operational error,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Abels </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>.

 Moslem fundamentalist leaders in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said today that suicide squads were preparing to carry out the `` death sentence'' imposed on novelist <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> and his publishers by <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. The declaration on <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> followed other reports that death squads from Islamic countries were en route to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in search of the writer, whose novel `` The Satanic Verses'' has outraged many Moslem fundamentalists. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, which reopened its embassy in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in December for the first time in eight years, condemned the threats and announced it had frozen plans to `` build up further our embassy.'' <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said telephone callers threatened to bomb British planes to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> unless <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> appeared in public. Two airlines, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, said they were taking the threat seriously. The Indian news agency said a man claiming to speak for the previously unheard of Iranian Guards telephoned its <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> office today with the threats. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s government demanded the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> ban the book and that all copies of it be destroyed. Six people died in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> during a weekend riot over the book. An Iranian cleric on Wednesday offered up to $ 2.6 million for <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s murder, and the author canceled a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> promotional tour that was scheduled to begin Friday. A leading Islamic theologian in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> said today <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> erred in sending death squads after <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> without first giving him a chance to repent. <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hossam-el-Din </PERSON> said the book should be banned and burned, but executing its author would be `` virtually impossible'' under the tenets of Islam. British news media said the Indian-born <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> was hiding with his wife, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> novelist <PERSON> Marianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON>, under police guard.

The Foreign Office called <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s statement `` totally unacceptable.'' `` We recognize that Moslems and others may have strong views about the contents of Mr. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book,'' it said in a statement. `` However, no one has the right to incite people to violence on British soil or against British citizens.'' <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, 41, was born into a Moslem family in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> but is a British citizen. Since `` The Satanic Verses'' was published in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in September, it has sold more than 100,000 copies here and received critical acclaim. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said today protests were being filed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> seeking a ban on the novel. Pakistani fundamentalist leaders called for nationwide protests Friday to condemn the book and denounce the deaths and injuries in Sunday's protests by Moslem fundamentalists demanding `` The Satanic Verses'' be pulled from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shelves.

 Fourteen black leaders convicted of trespassing in their bid to remove the Confederate battle flag from atop the state Capitol dome have asked a judge to dismiss the charges. The defendants, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> and 13 black legislators, pleaded innocent Wednesday in circuit court as they sought a jury trial on the trespass charges. Last month a district judge convicted and fined the 14 defendants $ 100 each in the misdemeanor case at the close of a lengthy, non-jury proceeding. But the 14 defendants filed an appeal which sent their case to circuit court. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, who is to review various pre-trial motions, did not immediately set a date for a jury trial. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, as part of a campaign by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, called for the Confederate flag to be removed from the Capitol last year. On Feb. 2, 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> led the delegation of 14 to a fence surrounding the Capitol, which was closed for restoration. He was arrested for trespassing when he grabbed the fence as if he might climb it. The others were arrested in sequence as they put a hand on the chain-link fence. Gov. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, the state's first Republican governor this century, has said repeatedly he feels the Confederate flag is a historic symbol and he will not remove it unless instructed to do so by the Legislature. A measure to remove the flag died in the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last year.

<DATELINE>FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Floodwaters that drove hundreds of people from their homes, closed roads and toppled a railroad bridge rose today to their highest levels in 10 years or more though rainfall eased off after four straight days. At 9 a.m., the <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Frankfort </LOCATION> was at 43.3 feet, 12.3 feet above flood level, and rising at 0.2 feet per hour. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> predicted a crest of 44 feet for later today, which would still be 4.7 feet below the level of water that devastated the capital in December 1978. National Guard troops were called out with trucks and equipment after Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> declared a state of emergency on Wednesday. `` We're trying to keep our spirits higher than the water,'' said <PERSON> Verna </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouser </PERSON>, a city commissioner in the town of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> who was helping remove records and equipment from City Hall. The <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, about 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, was expected to crest at a record 53 feet, and all roads leading into the town of 400 were flooded. Though rainfall tapered off today in most parts of the state, flooding would remain a `` major problem,'' particularly for people living in low-lying areas and for motorists, the weather service said. In neighboring <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, the weather service canceled a flash flood watch after only light rainfall was reported overnight; and in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, minor flooding was reported and several rivers were expected to crest at or near flood stage. But the flooding was most severe in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, where rainfall in the central and western parts of the state since Sunday has totaled up to 9 inches, sending the <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, Licking, Salt, <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, Barren and Rough rivers crashing out of their banks. At least 650 people were evacuated, including about 140 in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Junction </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Bullitt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and 100 in <LOCATION> Frankfort </LOCATION>, said the state Division of Disaster and <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. `` I feel sorry for everyone we take out,'' said <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, emergency services coordinator for <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` You feel good about helping them out, but you think about what they're leaving behind.'' More than 80 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> were being used for security in the state capital and to help with evacuations elsewhere, officials said. The <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which splits the state capital, made no distinction between rich and poor, lapping around stately old homes in an affluent section at the edge of downtown and the depressed <LOCATION> Bellepoint </LOCATION> neighborhood on the opposite bank. Crews worked to place sandbags around buildings. Capitol Avenue, the landscaped approach to the Capitol building and governor's mansion, was blocked by water for about three blocks. But the landmark buildings were on higher ground and were not in danger. At a <LOCATION> Jim </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beam </LOCATION> distillery in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, workers were brought in today by boat, said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON>, spokesman at the company's <LOCATION> Clermont </LOCATION> headquarters. `` That's the only way to get in and out,'' she said. The plant, which has a flood-control system to keep water out of the plant, continued to operate at full capacity, she said. Elsewhere, a <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> railroad trestle across the Rolling Fork of the <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> was swept away at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, and scores of roads and tens of schools in the state were closed because of high water. No fatalities were reported Wednesday, but three people drowned on Tuesday and a fourth was missing and presumed drowned.

 A former <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest who is the leader of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s most active leftist guerrilla group claimed in a letter published today that insurgent groups control one-fourth of the Latin American country. The letter from <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, to former president <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelsen </PERSON> was published by a half dozen Colombian dailies. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> has tried to get Colombian guerrillas and the government to negotiate a truce with <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s six leftist guerrilla groups. No one answered the telephone at the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s public affairs office today when The Associated Press tried to ask the ministry about the guerrilla claim. In the last four years, <LOCATION> AP </LOCATION> reporters have found towns where police stations have been abandoned because of guerrilla activity. The letter was received Wednesday by <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, the same day that <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>'s guerrillas reportedly ambushed two river boats in northern <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. Five government soldiers, five sailors and 20 guerrillas were killed, the commander of the army's 2nd Brigade, Gen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Salcedo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lora </PERSON>, said in a broadcast interview with the Colombian radio chain <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION>. The reported ambush occurred on the <LOCATION> Cauca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, 240 miles north of the capital of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. About 150 guerrillas with automatic weapons caught the two boats in a crossfire near the village of <LOCATION> Guaranda </LOCATION>, the general said.

<TEXT>
 One of two sea lions snared by wildlife agents in an attempt to protect a wild fish run died overnight before wildlife agents could return it to the ocean, an official said today. `` We lost one of the animals,'' said <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Alabaster </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. He did not have immediate details on why the sea lion died. Wildlife agents agents trapped the sea lions in a floating cage Wednesday and had planned to release the mammals today on the southewest <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> coast. They were to have been transported by truck. For five years, sea lions have been hanging out at the <LOCATION> Ballard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Locks </LOCATION> a few miles north of downtown <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, wolfing down the steelhead and salmon that use a fish ladder to get from Puget Sound to <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and the spawning streams beyond. The sea lion's death will not halt the effort to remove the marine mammals, <PERSON> Alabaster </PERSON> said, adding that trapping would continue today. So far, protective nets, tape recordings of killer whales, firecrackers and foul-tasting chemicals have failed to stop the steelhead and salmon suppers enjoyed by the voracious <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> sea lions. Some local fishing advocates have suggested the 20 or so beasts be shot, but they are protected by federal law. According to federal agents, one of the two sea lions captured Wednesday, known as Blue Eye because of a cataract, has been a problem at the locks for three years. It was not immediately clear which sea lion had died. The plan was to tranquilize the sea lions, attach radio transmitters to them and transport them by truck on a trip of five hours or more to the coast for release today off the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, 250 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLong </PERSON>, a marine mammal biologist with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, admitted that scientists have no idea whether `` Operation Goodbye'' will work. He conceded that Blue Eye certainly knows the way back. `` He's come back at least three years in a row from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and if he wants to come back, he'll return,'' <PERSON> DeLong </PERSON> said, adding that he could probably make the trip in two days if he hurried. Wildlife officials said they eventually hope to capture at least a half dozen animals and haul them to the peninsula, then see if they return. If they do n't, the rest of the problem animals that can be caught will be moved, <PERSON> DeLong </PERSON> said. Wednesday's operation was observed by <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Deeble </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>, which has protested some of the anti-sea lion actions in the past but gave qualified support to the removal effort. <PERSON> Deeble </PERSON> said a primary concern was the drugging of the sea lions, which he said could kill the animals. <PERSON> Deeble </PERSON> said long-term solutions to the problem of the hungry sea lions would include modifying the approach the fish have to make to the fish ladder, and increasing the number of fish in the watershed. However, that could be difficult at the rate the steelhead are being killed by the sea lions. Steelhead are rainbow trout which return to their native rivers and streams in western <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after a few years in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. The male sea lions, which summer in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> waters and winter off the coasts of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, have increased dramatically in numbers since the passage of the Marine Mammal Protection Act in the mid-1970s.

<TEXT>
 A businessman was sentenced to 27 years in federal prison today for masterminding the smuggling of a record 7,300 pounds of Colombian cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in hollowed-out lumber last spring. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> rejected tearful pleas by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsalickis </PERSON>, 61, to impose a lighter sentence. The judge said he thought evidence in the trial had been clear. <PERSON> Tsalickis </PERSON>, jailed since his arrest last May, faced from 10 years to life for his conviction in October on two counts of smuggling and two counts of drug trafficking. During a monthlong trial, the government claimed he was working with a ruthless Colombian drug organization known as the <ORGANIZATION> Cali </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION>. Prosecutors had urged the maximum sentence, telling <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> that their calculations showed the cocaine haul translated into 57 million doses. But the judge's sentence was within federal sentencing guidelines, which called for a prison term of 24 to 30 years. `` This is the largest seizure in the history of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> in which there has been an arrest,'' assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Furr </PERSON> told <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>. `` Your sentence must punish, deter others and promote respect for the law.'' <PERSON> Tsalickis </PERSON>, who lived in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> for 35 years and ran an import-export business, read from a statement, breaking down and crying as he did so. `` If I did harm society in the eyes of the court, then I am truly sorry,'' he said. His attorney, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkles </PERSON>, said an appeal would be filed. During Tsalickis' trial in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> federal court, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prosecutors told jurors that <PERSON> Tsalickis </PERSON> orchestrated the smuggling operation in which cocaine was hidden inside bundles of cedar lumber shipped from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. Tsalickis and two Colombian associates, <PERSON> Freddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez-Rivera </PERSON>, 28, and <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Narvaez </PERSON>, 35, were arrested May 3. The two Colombians were convicted of conspiracy to smuggle the cocaine in a separate trial. Federal and local drug agents, acting on a tip, had watched the trio as they organized the unloading of the lumber in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, separated the lumber containing the cocaine from the rest of the wood, and had it transported by truck to a <LOCATION> Tarpon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> warehouse owned by <PERSON> Tsalickis </PERSON>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> today authorized an independence plan and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, setting in motion the end of 74 years of South African rule over the continent's last colony. The 15 council members unanimously adopted a resolution implementing an independence plan for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. April 1 was set as the date to begin the one-year plan for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s transition to an independent, black majority-ruled nation. Today's resolution also approved a report by Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> on implementing the plan, which calls for sending 4,650 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers, 500 police and 1,000 civilian election monitors to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s Namibian independence mission will be called the U.N.

The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> is expected to authorize funds for a 70-man team of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military observers who will monitor the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> as neighboring <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> becomes independent. The stage was set for the Cuban pullout and the Namibian independence process in December, when <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> signed accords at <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Headquarters pledging their cooperation with a southwest African pace plan. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has stationed troops in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> at that country's request since 1975, to defend <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government from attacks by South African troops and the U.S.-backed rebels of <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Liberation of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has ruled <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, since it captured the territory from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> during World War I. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s predecessor, the League of Nations, gave <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> a mandate to govern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> in 1920, but since World War II the World Court, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> all have ruled that <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>'s mandate is void. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> refused to relinquish control of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> without the withdrawal of the Cuban troops, saying their presence just over <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s northern border could intimidate voters during the independence. Under the southwest <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> peace accords, half of the 50,000 Cuban soldiers will have withdrawn by Nov. 1, when <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> is scheduled to begin a week of elections for a constituent assembly. That constituent assembly will draft a constitution and organize a black majority-ruled government in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, with independence envisaged in April 1990. All Cuban troops are to be out of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> by July 1991. Beginning April 1, the South African military is to reduce its forces in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> to 1,500 troops confined to barracks under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> supervision, and cut back the size of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s police force. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers will also monitor camps in which the guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, will stay. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, a Marxist-influenced independence movement led by <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON>, is expected to win a majority of the seats in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s constituent assembly, but if it fails to hold two-thirds of the seats it will have to form a coalition with some of the other parties in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> A coalition would probably result in a multiparty state, observers say, but if <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> wins two-thirds of the seats in the contituent assembly it will probably declare a one-party state.

<TEXT>
 Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s state funeral may be the biggest in modern times, a Foreign Ministry official said Thursday. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> expects representatives of 154 countries to attend the Feb. 24 rites, led by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and including 54 other heads of state and many more royals, vice presidents, prime ministers and foreign ministers, according to a senior official, who spoke on condition he not be identified. The funeral is budgeted at $ 74 million, including $ 25.4 million to be spent on the funeral site, where there will be a sanctuary and two huge tents to shelter 10,000 dignitaries, $ 19 million for security and $ 21 million to build a mausoleum. The Japanese press called it the most expensive state funeral in history. Soon after <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> died of cancer at the age of 87 on Jan. 7, the government notified all 165 countries with which <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has relations that they were welcome to send delegations to the funeral. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> quickly accepted, but some countries debated vigorously whether to send high-level representatives because of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s role as leader in World War II The <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, for instance, is sending its foreign minister but not a member of the royal family because of bitter memories of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s harsh treatment of the Dutch East Indies. The overall high level of the delegates is gratifying to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the Foreign Ministry official said. `` The number of guests and their high rank is beyond our expectations,'' he said. The number of official foreign mourners is expected to be at least 600, he said, acknowledging difficult problems with protocol and logistics. Some ambassadors complained they will have to group up and arrive at the funeral in buses. He said Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s Cabinet still was wrestling with the protocol issue of how to seat the guests By tradition, those with longer tenure should have more prominent seats. That would leave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in office less than a month, in the back of the crowd. `` We are studying all the precedents of past funerals, and I hope our government will come to a fast conclusion,'' he said. Asked how <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would be treated, he laughed nervously and said: `` The matter is not so simple.'' He did not comment further. The 154 countries to be represented include 145 that are actually sending delegates from abroad, he said. Nine are to be represented by ambassadors accredited to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Other recent state funerals: _ The 1963 funeral of President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> drew representatives from more than 100 countries. _ The 1980 funeral for <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> drew 127 foreign delegations. _ The 1981 funeral of <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> drew representatives from more than 80 countries; the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sent former Presidents <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. _ The 1984 funeral of Soviet leader <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Andropov </PERSON> drew more than 100 foreign delegations.

<TEXT>
 Dozens of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most famous writers and thinkers called for an amnesty for political prisoners in an open letter sent Thursday to the government and ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` An amnesty ... would be beneficial to the atmosphere of reform and in accordance with the increasing respect for human rights which is a pervasive trend in the world today,'' said the letter, copies of which were given to journalists by several of the signers. It was addressed to the standing committee of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature, and the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The 33 signers ranged from <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> <PERSON> Xin </PERSON>, 87, one of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most famous pre-Communist woman writers, to 26-year-old author <PERSON> Lao </PERSON> <PERSON> Mu </PERSON>, who helped draft and distribute the letter. `` I think it is the first time since -LRB- 1949 -RRB- that intellectuals of all generations, writers from the 1930s and current writers, all have joined in such an action,'' said <PERSON> Bei </PERSON> <PERSON> Dao </PERSON>, a 40-year-old poet and short story writer who got the idea to draft the letter. `` I think intellectuals are waking up,'' he said. `` I do n't have any special interest in politics. Like most writers, I'm interested in my work. But I have a conscience.'' There are no reliable figures for the number of political prisoners in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The London-based human rights group <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> estimates there are thousands of prisoners of conscience, including political dissidents, clergy and members of minority groups such as Tibetans opposed to Chinese rule. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> acknowledges jailing `` counterrevolutionaries'' but has never given a number. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most famous dissident, astrophysicist <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, made a similar call for an amnesty in a letter to <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> last month. The new letter expressed `` deep concern'' for <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>'s proposal. Like <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, the petitioners singled out <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> <PERSON> Jingsheng </PERSON>, one of the leaders of a brief political thaw called the <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> was arrested in 1979 and sentenced to 15 years in prison after calling for democracy as a `` fifth modernization'' to go along with <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s program of updating industry, agriculture, science and national defense. `` We hear <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> has gone mad in prison,'' said <PERSON> Bei </PERSON>. `` We have no proof, there's no way to contact him.'' Several dozen other Democracy Wall activists also were arrested and many remain jailed. `` Of course we hope the government will respond and give amnesty to <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> and the others,'' <PERSON> Bei </PERSON> said. `` But realistically _ I do n't know For such a large group of prominent intellectuals to express their view, I think it must have influence ... eventually.'' <PERSON> Su </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaozhi </PERSON>, a leading Marxist theorist who was dismissed in 1987 as director of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Marxism-Leninism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> because of his liberalism, said the government probably `` wo n't pay attention.'' But Su said he did n't think anyone would be punished because of the letter. `` The signers are very famous. They will have to think how to treat us,'' he said. The letter comes during a period of unusual outspokenness by Chinese intellectuals, who know well the government's pattern of allowing brief periods of free discussion and then cracking down. Small groups of liberal intellectuals have begun meeting to discuss such dangerous topics as democracy and multiparty rule. <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> <PERSON> Wanding </PERSON>, another Democracy Wall activist who was jailed from 1979-83, has declared 1989 a memorial year for his jailed colleagues and issued a series of essays calling attention to human rights abuses. The letter suggested the political amnesty be given to mark two other anniversaries this year: the 40th anniversary of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s communist revolution and the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement of 1919, which began as a student protest against foreign occupation of parts of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and turned into a movement for liberalism and democratic reform <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jun </PERSON>, a former student who signed the letter, and <PERSON> Bei </PERSON> both stressed that the letter signers have many different political views. `` But this is just one point on which we all agree,'' <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> said of the amnesty. He said he hoped to continue collecting signatures, even though the original letter has been mailed. Other signers included <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Zehou </PERSON>, a philosopher who was a delegate to the <ORGANIZATION> 7th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that met last year; <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruoshui </PERSON>, former deputy editor of the party newspaper, the People's Daily; playwright <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuguang </PERSON>; and novelist <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Jie </PERSON>, whose works have been widely translated

 <PERSON> Ida </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehre </PERSON>, one of the country's best-known actresses and a postwar pioneer of the German stage, died Thursday at the age of 88 She died of a heart attack in a <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> hospital, said officials with the <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kammerspiele </LOCATION>, the famed theater founded and directed by Ms. <PERSON> Ehre </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Ehre </PERSON> is credited with being a major force in reviving the German stage after years of cultural repression under the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> regime of <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>. She started the Kammerspiele seven months after <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s defeat in 1945 Ms. <PERSON> Ehre </PERSON>, born to Austrian parents, was a victim of Nazi repression because of her Jewish faith. She was banned from the stage in 1933 after moving to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. One of the earliest works she staged at the Kammerspiele was `` The Man Outside,'' a play written by <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Borchert </PERSON> about the torments of a German soldier after his return home from the war. The premiere of the play at Ms. <PERSON> Ehre </PERSON>'s theater lifted the work to fame. She also staged works by <PERSON> Thorton </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sartre </PERSON> and other non-German authors, giving the Kammerspiele an international reputation. Ms. <PERSON> Ehre </PERSON> studied at the Academy for Music and Theater in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. She gave her first professional performance in 1918 and performed in dozens of <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> cities.

<HEAD>Housing Starts Surge 8 Percent in January</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Housing construction posted its biggest gain in nearly a year during January, the government reported Thursday, but analysts said the surge was due more to unusually mild weather than an upturn in the market. Construction of new homes and apartments was up 8 percent in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.69 million units after inching up just 0.1 percent during December, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported. It was the biggest monthly increase since an 8.6 percent rise in February 1988 and placed housing activity at its highest level since the March 1987 annual rate of 1.72 million units. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> called the figures `` good news for the housing industry and a good sign that people are confident in the economy.'' Analysts said the increase was mainly the result of unseasonably warm, dry weather throughout much of the country, which allowed more housing starts than in a typical January. Small increases can be amplified as the figures are annualized and seasonally adjusted. `` We do n't believe this is representative of the underlying trend in the market,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiders </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION>, said of January's surge. `` We do n't expect it to hold this way We're betting on a slowdown as we go through the year.'' Housing construction dropped 8.2 percent in 1988 to its lowest level in six years, and is expected to decline again this year as mortgage rates continue to rise and the general economic expansion slows. Nevertheless, analysts say the housing market still is relatively healthy and that January's numbers may suggest some new strength. `` It's really pretty surprising to see this much strength in the housing market when interest rates have been rising and when the affordability of housing is getting harder for people to meet,'' said economist <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Regalia </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>. `` Underneath it all, we're seeing a surprisingly strong housing market given the financial conditions,'' he said. Single-family homes were built in January at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.2 million units, the highest since September 1987, when the rate was 1.23 million. January's figure was up 7.1 percent from December. <PERSON> Seiders </PERSON> said part of the strength in the single-family market was due to the use of adjustable-rate mortgages that allow families to start out making lower monthly payments than otherwise possible. Interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages averaged 10.56 percent last week, up from 9.84 percent a year earlier, according to a survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. On one-year adjustable rate mortgages, lenders were asking an average initial rate of 8.61 percent, up from 7.61 percent a year earlier Apartment construction, a volatile category, was up 10.1 percent last month to 490,000 units, after a 3.7 percent gain in December. The apartment sector has been weakened by high vacancy rates and changes under the 1986 tax law that reduced incentives for investing in rental projects. Overall, January's gains in new construction were concentrated in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, where housing starts shot up 51.8 percent to an annual rate of 296,000 units. Analysts again said mild weather was behind the upturn in a region where the housing market has been weak in recent months after an earlier boom during which prices soared. `` The Northeast overall is still a market that is not as strong as it was a couple years ago,'' Regalia said. `` It's going through a normal cycle and it's going to be ebbing somewhat in the coming months, but I do n't see that as crashing.'' Construction rose 4.4 percent in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in January, to a rate of 449,000 units, and 3 percent in the South to 616,000 units. Housing starts were down 3.8 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, to a rate of 332,000 units. Housing permits, a good barometer of future housing activity, were down 2.7 percent last month to a rate of 1.52 million units after rising 3.3 percent in December. Housing construction reached its post-recession peak in 1986, when 1.81 million units were built, then began sliding. Last year, the level was 1.49 million units.

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s transportation secretary today urged aviation officials to consider banning electronic devices from airplane luggage or at least requiring such items be carried onto jets rather than checked as luggage. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> made his comments after investigators in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, said the bomb that blew up <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 was hidden in a radio-cassette player and loaded on with luggage, probably in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. `` This is further evidence of the extent of this serious problem,'' <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> told the 33-member council of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> said items such as radios and computers `` can not be easily opened. They provide enough space to conceal explosives, and the electrical components of explosive devices may not be distinguished under X-ray from those of the equipment itself. We need to ask ourselves whether these devices should be allowed to be carried on aircraft.'' <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> said one option would be to ban electronic devices from checked baggage. `` Should we at least no longer allow them in checked baggage, and require them to be presented at the check-in, perhaps for conveyance in the least vulnerable part of the aircraft?'' he suggested. The council has been considering whether steps should be taken to limit the carrying of radios, computers and other electronical equipment. It also is considering whether to direct its staff to study ways in which aircraft design could take security considerations into account. `` I think that some fairly simple and inexpensive modifications could make it harder for terrorists to hide a bomb on board and easier for security staff to search cabins, toilets and galleys,'' <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> said, citing better locking systems on aircraft doors as an example. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British transportation officials have called for swift efforts to combat terrorism in the skies through tougher screening of passengers and luggage and better bomb-detection devices. `` People around the world are calling for leadership and decisive action to eliminate the gruesome, common threat of terrorism in the skies,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> told the aviation meeting on its opening day Wednesday. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had asked that the council convene the two-day meeting because of the Dec. 21 bombing of Flight 103, which killed all 259 people on board and 11 people on the ground in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. Chief Superintendent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, who is heading the investigation into the bombing, today refused to describe the size of the recorder and said it was not certain the bomb was put aboard in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, where the flight originated. But answering reporters' questions, he said `` the balance of probabilities'' pointed to <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> rather than <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where the New York-bound flight changed jets and took on new passengers. Although the 160-member <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency meeting in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> has no power to enforce its resolutions, the presence of more than a dozen transport ministers has underscored their concern about the problem. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> reminded the council that 867 people have died in 21 explosions aboard civilian airliners in the last decade. Members have discussed a two-tier system in which more stringent security systems could be placed in areas of highest risk. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aviation system has instituted more stringent security measures in recent weeks, but <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials say concerted international action is needed.

 Text of a statement Thursday from black anti-apartheid leaders on <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, wife of <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Today's press conference is called after the culminating of community meetings in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> and throughout the country. The present controversy surrounding Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s `` football club'' has been the subject of intense discussion within the ranks of the mass democratic movement. Numerous attempts have been made to resolve this matter, but without much success. We have now reached the state where we have no option but to speak publicly on what is a very sensitive and painful matter. The <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> family has always occupied a very special position in the hearts of our people. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has been painfully separated from her husband for most of her married life _ first, while <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> worked in the underground of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> and thereafter, his imprisonment following the Rivonia trial. During this period, she has had to rear her children single-handedly in the face of lengthy house arrests, detentions and her cruel banishment to <LOCATION> Brandfort </LOCATION>. We pay tribute to her contribution. In recent years, Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s actions have increasingly led her into conflict with various sections of the oppressed people and with the mass democratic movement as a whole. The recent conflict in the community has centered largely around the conduct of her so-called football club, which has been widely condemned by the community. In particular, we are outraged by the reign of terror that the team has been associated with. Not only is Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> associated with the team, in fact, the team is her own creation. We are of the view that Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has abused the trust and confidence which she has enjoyed over the years. She has not been a member of any of the democratic structures of the <ORGANIZATION> UDF </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and <ORGANIZATION> COSATU </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of South African Trade Unions -RRB-, and she has often acted without consulting the democratic movement. Often, her practices have violated the spirit and ethos of the democratic movement. Numerous efforts have been made to reconcile the conflict between Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and the community. The last of these efforts was the formation of a crisis committee comprising of some of our most able and respected members. On every occasion Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has refused to cooperate and has chosen to disregard the sentiments of the community. The democratic movement has uncompromisingly fought against violations of human rights from whatever quarters. We are not prepared to remain silent where those who are violating human rights claim to be doing so in the name of the struggle against apartheid. We are outraged at Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s complicity in the recent abductions and assault of Stompie -LRB- <PERSON> Seipei </PERSON> -RRB-. Had <PERSON> Stompie </PERSON> and his three colleagues not been abducted by Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s `` football team,'' he would have been alive today. The mass democratic movement hereby distances itself from Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and her actions. We call on our people, in particular, the <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> community, to exercise this distancing in a dignified manner. We take the opportunity to reaffirm our unqualified support for our leader, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, and call for his immediate release. The actions associated with this football team, and even with members of his family, should never be used to undermine the esteem in which we still hold comrade <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>.

 Hundreds of rescue workers with dogs Thursday searched the wreckage of an apartment building destroyed by an explosion of unknown origin that killed at least 13 people, officials said. The blast Wednesday also left 21 people hospitalized, six of them seriously hurt. More than 300 rescue workers worked by hand to search the debris of the 18th century building, known as the `` house of heads'' because of the sculptured heads which ornamented the facade. They used amplifiers to capture any cries in the rubble and worked throughout the night. The explosion also damaged nearby buildings in the center of this <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> port city, including a section of the city hall. Mayor <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Trucy </PERSON> said the explosion appeared to have occurred on the second floor of the six-story apartment house, which included a grocery store on the ground floor and some offices. Authorities opened an investigation into the cause of the explosion, initially attributed to gas. The gas company, <LOCATION> Gaz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, said it had received no notice of a gas leak prior to the explosion. A dentist in the building, Dr. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, said he had smelled a burning odor `` like a big short circuit'' just before the disaster. Officials said many victims, severely mangled under tons of stone and metal, were being identified by the clothes they wore. `` We wo n't stop the search until all the debris has been removed,'' said one rescuer.

<HEAD>Guerrilla Attack In El Salvador Kills Nine Soldiers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Leftist guerrillas attacked an army-guarded cotton cooperative and two Civil Defense posts in the central region today, killing at least nine soldiers, the military said. The attack came while the rebels and political parties negotiated where and when to discuss a rebel proposal to delay this year's presidential elections The rebels attacked the <PERSON> Entre </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> cooperative with mortar and rifle fire before dawn, according to a preliminary report from the armed forces in the capital. It said six soldiers were killed and seven wounded in the attack 20 miles southeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The report made no mention of guerrilla casualties. Broadcast reports from radio correspondents said eight soldiers were killed. The rebels attacked the cooperative as part of their strategy of economic sabotage in waging their nine-year war against the U.S.-backed government. They also attacked <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> posts in <LOCATION> Jerusalen </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ostuma </LOCATION> in the province of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION> early today, the military report said. It reported three soldiers were killed and three wounded in those attacks. The fighting flared despite an announcement Wednesday by 13 political parties who said they were willing to meet with a rebel delegation next week in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. They suggested the meeting take place Monday. Rebels proposed last month that the presidential election scheduled for March 19 be postponed until September, giving the opposition more time to prepare. In a dramatic change of policy, the guerrillas said they would participate in the election and respect the outcome if voting was put off and if their conditions regarding security and fraud were met. However, the government and military have virtually ruled out any postponement. The rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, or <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, is favored to win the March election, and it too is against postponement.

Relief flights were stopped Tuesday after the <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> demanded changes in the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>' notification procedure for its flights to the cities of <LOCATION> Wau </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Aweil </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Akon </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Yirol </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Juerg </PERSON> <PERSON> Bischoff </PERSON> To ensure safe passage, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> notifies both the <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> government and the rebels of all relief flights. <PERSON> Bischoff </PERSON> said he expects the airlift, begun Dec. 4, to resume `` in a matter of days.'' He said the negotiations concern `` technical issues.'' About 40 delegates of the all-Swiss humanitarian agency have remained in the area to distribute food and medicine to the needy, <PERSON> Bischoff </PERSON> said. Tens of thousands of people are known to need emergency aid in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. The rebels, who gained control of the region, have allowed <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> relief planes to land in the area's cities, where peasant farmers have fled to escape the guerrilla war Hundreds of thousands of Sudanese are believed to face the risk of starvation unless food is delivered throughout the country, before the rains start in May, to about 4 million people displaced by rebellion, drought and famine. The government of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, which has battled the rebels since 1983, has invited <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> relief officials to <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> on March 8-9 to plan a massive anti-famine campaign. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other Western nations are pressuring the Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> to improve the distribution of food and other aid to all sections of his country. His government has often cited the rebellion in the south as posing too great a danger for relief flights and convoys. The government has allowed little aid to reach the south, where an estimated 500,000 people died of starvation last year.

 Moslem guerrillas fired a barrage of rockets into the capital and another city today, one day after the Soviets completed their troop withdrawal, and official reports said at least 13 people were killed. Also today, the Afghan foreign minister said the government has asked the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to set up outposts along the border with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to stem the flow of arms to Moslem guerrillas. In the attack on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> by U.S.-backed guerrillas, one rocket landed outside a house in western <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, killing three children playing in the street, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. Another young girl was killed and her mother's legs were blown off but she survived, the spokesman said. Less than a half mile away, a rocket struck near a power transmission station, killing a bus driver and two men, the official said. Five people were injured in the rocket attack, said the spokesman, who demanded anonymity. Rebel rockets also hit near a Sikh community and the airport, which was closed today because of heavy snow. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Badakhshi </PERSON>, who lost his 11-year-old daughter in today's attack, asked `` Who is doing this? Speaking to foreign reporters, he added: `` I've lost my daughter, and now I'm losing my mind.'' About 105 miles to the south in <LOCATION> Ghazni </LOCATION> city, rebel rockets killed six people, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> said in a report monitored in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> said 34 guerrillas were killed in fighting during the previous 24 hours. The radio also charged that 600 Pakistani troops marched toward <LOCATION> Ghazni </LOCATION> on Friday to carry out `` terrorist activities.'' It said some were deployed in the garrison town of <LOCATION> Urgun </LOCATION> about 15 miles from the Pakistani border. Pakistani officials had no immediate reaction, but they have denied previous accusations by the Afghan government that they planned to invade the eastern city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Wednesday ended nine years of military intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, leaving Afghan troops alone in their fight against the guerrillas. In his comments today, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> accused <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and other Western nations opposed to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Marxist government of blocking emergency airlifts of food into <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, which is facing severe shortages. An official with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, which is coordinating the airlift, declined to comment on <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON>'s statement. Some Western officials have predicted that the Afghan army will be unable to prevent <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and other major Afghan cities from being taken by Pakistani-based Moslem guerrilla forces now that the Soviet forces are gone. The foreign minister said <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> has asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Good </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to set up outposts near six towns along the border. The agency, <LOCATION> UNGOMAP </LOCATION>, monitors compliance with the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord signed in April that paved the way for the withdrawal of an estimated 115,000 Red Army troops and called on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to stop interfering in each other's internal affairs <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> has asked that outposts be set up near the towns of <LOCATION> Quttarr </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Landi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kotall </PERSON>, <PERSON> Torkahn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Chaman </LOCATION>, Spin Boldak and Parchinarr. `` We have requested that UNGOMAP establish outposts along the border to prevent the open transport of arms, ammunition and other deadly weapons into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>,'' he said. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> thanked <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for its military support and accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of trampling on the accord for the Soviet withdrawal.

 Gunmen burst into a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> clubhouse in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> today and opened fire with automatic weapons, injuring five people, police said. An extremist splinter of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility. The incident occurred at midday at the <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, a drinking spot in the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Shankill </LOCATION> district, police said. A witness told <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> radio that three attackers lined up some men against the bar and opened fire with Kalashnikov assault rifles. `` They singled out a few men on the premises, put them against the bar, and started to shoot indiscriminately,'' said the witness, who was not identified. <ORGANIZATION> Nearby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said it admitted one man in very serious condition with head injuries and two with serious chest wounds. Two women were in stable condition with stomach injuries. The Irish <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a small offshoot of the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, claimed responsibility in a statement to <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> news media, saying it was avenging recent attacks on Catholics. Protestant extremists claimed responsibility for the shooting deaths of <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Fusco </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> businessman with no known political links; and <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Finucane </PERSON>, who was prominent as an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> suspects. Also this week, gunmen killed <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Davey </PERSON>, a member of the Magherafelt town council for <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s political wing. No claim of responsibility was made. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the province with the overwhelmingly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. The Irish <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, formed by disaffected <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members in the 1970s, has been reduced in size by an internal feud but is believed to retain a handful of armed activists. After the attack, a van was found burning outside <PERSON> Divis </PERSON> <PERSON> Flats </PERSON>, a Catholic-populated tenement block, and police said they were investigating whether it was hijacked by the gunmen.

 A 1.2-million-gallon tank of molasses burst at a sugar factory, spilling a cascade of sticky liquid that coated three workers and flattened a small building `` as if someone had stepped on a pop can.'' One of the workers was swept 100 feet out of the building Wednesday and waded through the syrupy flood to help his co-workers from the rubble, <LOCATION> Scotts </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bluff </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's deputies said. No one was seriously hurt. `` At this point we're just going to try to contain it. There's nothing hazardous about the material It's just sticky,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagaser </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plant where the accident occurred about 20 miles east of the <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> border. The factory's one-story, modular office-laboratory was demolished when it was buried by a wave of molasses. Sheriff's Deputy <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLara </PERSON> said it looked `` as if someone had stepped on a pop can, just squashed it down.'' City crews built a dike to keep the molasses from entering a storm sewer. The wave apparently crested at 10 feet, leaving marks that high on walls and piles of dirt nearby. `` We saw this stuff all gushing out and saw the cars by the road,'' said witness <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wooden </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Scottsbluff </LOCATION>. `` We saw people digging themselves out. It looked like a flood.'' The three workers caught in the goop, <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Dilley </PERSON>, 69, <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON>, 45, of <PERSON> Gering </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, 45, were treated at <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in Scotts Bluff for cuts and scrapes. Sheriff's Deputy <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Medearis </PERSON> said the workers told him they heard a rumble and knew the building they were in was starting to collapse. <PERSON> Medearis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON>, who was washed out of the building, told him he kept trying to scramble to his knees as he tried to get back to the others. `` He said he was submerged but then was able to see daylight,'' <PERSON> Medearis </PERSON> said. The molasses damaged four vehicles near the building, two of them apparently rolled over by the wave. `` I just heard a big old boom, then I saw a wall of molasses that carried those cars about 25 or 30 yards. It just picked them up and slid them,'' said witness <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Medearis </PERSON> said the molasses was valued at $ 520,000. Today, <PERSON> Sagaser </PERSON> estimated the total damage at $ 1 million. The cause of the collapse was being investigated. <PERSON> Sagaser </PERSON> said the molasses is a by-product of its sugar refining operations and is sold as a supplement for cattle feed. `` We just finished filling the tank a day or two ago,'' he said. The collapse of the tank should not hurt operations at any Western Sugar plants, he added. A molasses tank that burst Jan. 15, 1919, in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> killed 21 people and injured another 150. The steel tank containing 2.3 million gallons of the sticky goo broke open, unleashing 30-foot waves of molasses.

 The Italian rock star <PERSON> Sabrina </PERSON> failed to impress <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> fans who paid up to $ 9 for a concert and ended up with only six or seven songs in a 30-minute appearance, a newspaper reported Thursday. At least 11 spectators at the Wednesday night concert were injured when thousands of fans crowded onto a dance floor to get a glimpse of the singer, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Moskovsky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolets </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Sabrina </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> amid fanfare usually reserved for a real `` superstar,'' including six limousines, eight back-up sedans, a luxury suite at the <ORGANIZATION> Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> and 70 bodyguards. `` Before the first show, Italians were strictly guarding and nobody could lay a finger on <PERSON> Sabrina </PERSON>'s equipment,'' the newspaper said. With 22,000 fans waiting at the Olympic Hall, she failed to show up on time, `` first washing her hair, then demanding a telephone call to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and a vase with fruit and towels in her dressing room,'' the newspaper said. `` After <PERSON> Sabrina </PERSON> appeared on the stage, the initial madness of fans was replaced by a strange silence _ at first she sang some of her own songs, then sensing the lack of enthusiasm, started to repeat some old songs from the repetoires of some popular groups,'' the newspaper said. `` After 30 minutes, the concert was over.'' As the fans left the concert hall, many were heard to mutter, `` Deceit!'' and `` Swindle!'' the newspaper's critic said. Noting the ticket prices of about $ 6.50 to $ 9 for six or seven songs, `` is n't that a bit too expensive?'' the critic said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the 11 fans were injured `` when thousands of spectators flooded the dance floor near the stage to catch a glimpse of the curvaceous singer.'' The news agency did not say if any of the injuries was serious.

<HEAD>Government Eases `Zero Tolerance' Fishing Boat Seizure Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After complaints from boatmen and an order from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the government on Thursday relaxed its policy of immediately seizing fishing boats on which a small amount of illegal drugs is found. The interim modification would apply only to commercial fishing vessels. But more changes in the year-old `` zero tolerance'' program to combat drug smuggling may be made before formal guidelines are issued, said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON>, a senior special agent with the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. He said officials were discussing whether to extend less strict procedures to other vessels, such as recreational craft and yachts and other private boats. Under policies that went into effect last March, federal agents were free to seize vessels within 12 miles of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> coastline if any amount of illegal drugs was found on board _ showing `` zero tolerance.'' Under the newly revized rules, <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> personnel would merely issue a summons to a commercial fishing vessel if a personal-use amount of drugs was found while the ship was engaged in fishing or en route to or from a fishing trip. Personal-use amounts generally are defined as no more than one gram of heroin or cocaine or one ounce of marijuana. When large amounts are found, vessels could still be immediately forfeited to the government, <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> said. Some fishing vessels could be allowed to complete their fishing expeditions, even if they lasted several days, and then surrender to Customs authorities who would determine whether the vessels should be seized or a fine imposed. The interim guidelines, which went into effect Thursday prior to adoption of formal regulations expected in several weeks, also require Customs to act within 20 days on petitions to return vessels. Officials acknowledge that it has sometimes taken up to several weeks for return of vessels where seizure was determine to be unwarranted. The new guidelines followed meetings of Customs Commissioner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> with fisheries representatives. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> signed an agreement with the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> associations in December calling for officials and the industry to work together to see that vessels belonging to association members are not used to transport illegal drugs into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Late last year, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> narrowly approved anti-drug law modifications that instructed the executive branch to issue new regulations that would not be so harsh in instances where a ship's captain or owner may have no knowledge of a crewmember's possession of a small quantity of an illegal substance

<TEXT>
 The absence of four words in a legal settlement could cost <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> up to $ 270 million in its 18-year patent infringement lawsuit against the federal government, a newspaper reported today. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Claims Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> ruled that the omission of the words `` except the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' in a 1987 out-of-court settlement between <LOCATION> Hughes </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> freed the government from liability regarding 13 government satellites built by a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported. Turner's ruling, issued last September, was published recently in the patent law journal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Patent Quarterly. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> had sued both the government and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, for patent infringement of a device used to control orbiting satellites. However, <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> settled out of court for $ 75 million in September 1987, and the settlement absolved <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> customers from liability. Because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> customer, and the phrase `` except the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' was omitted from the settlement, it can not be held liable for the 13 satellites <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> built for it, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> ruled. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, an aerospace firm and subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, claims the government used the orbiting control device on 108 satellites without paying required royalties. It is seeking $ 3.16 billion in damages, according to court documents. Government attorneys say <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> has overblown its claims and that it does n't possess a valid patent. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> is seeking a 15 percent royalty of the cost of the government satellites, in addition to other compensation. The royalties and delay compensation on those 13 satellites represent $ 270 million worth of claims against the government, according to a secret court filing <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> made Oct. 7, the newspaper reported. But under the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s method of valuing the satellites, the 13 spacecraft might be worth only $ 50 million. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> officials refused to comment today because the matter concerned litigation, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, a spokesman at the company's corporate headquarters <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, managing partner at <ORGANIZATION> Latham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, the law firm representing <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> in the case, said his firm made no such error.

 Police questioned <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> in a hospital emergency room, and within minutes local radio stations were broadcasting a description of the gunman she said threatened to kill her if she did n't open a safe. A black man, about 5-foot-10 with a goatee, had demanded money from <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON>, a nursing home receptionist who did n't want her last name used for fear her assailant might be able to identify her. He wore a tan jacket, a blue polo shirt and red <ORGANIZATION> Puma </ORGANIZATION> tennis shoes. He also had a tooth with a gold crown, listeners of <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION>'s five radio stations were told <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> said the man hit her on the back of the head before fleeing without taking any cash. Interrupting programming to broadcast suspects' descriptions and other information on armed robberies is part of a program called Radio COP begun by the <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> Feb. 1. Listeners are asked to call police if they see a suspect or can provide other tips. `` Most crime prevention programs are reactive. This is proactive,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who developed Radio COP, which stands for Call Our Police. As of Thursday, descriptions of five armed robberies had been broadcast, at an average of eight minutes after the crime was reported. No suspects have been arrested as a result of the broadcasts, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said, but police were pursuing one tip. Police suspect that a man charged in a convenience store hold-up two days after the nursing home incident is <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON>'s assailant. The district attorney's office said Thursday charges were pending. Because the man was arrested at the store, his description was not aired again. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said the broadcasts will make listeners more aware of suspicious activity and may deter criminals from committing robberies because they'll know 50,000 radio listeners will hear about it. `` Creating an awareness is the most important part of it,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. In January, before Radio COP began, <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> had 28 armed robberies, more than double the number during the same period of 1987. Police will monitor robbery rates for the next few months to evaluate the program's success. Radio COP is receiving praise from many sectors of the community, including radio executives. `` I think it will be an asset not only to the police department but to our station as well,'' said <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Bervert </PERSON>, news director for <ORGANIZATION> KTPK </ORGANIZATION>, a country music station. `` It will help keep us on top of what's going on in <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION>.'' One radio station balked at participating in the program, fearful that it could be held liable if it disseminated incorrect information. But disclaimers that tell listeners to call police if they see a suspect and to not get involved personally were strengthened, and the station joined the program by the time it began. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said he has received inquiries about Radio COP from as far away as <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` We always tell people to report things, but we never tell them what to report,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` This program does that.''

And I know he's going to fight hard for farming, for fair trade and for all the other important responsibilities for this department.'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, 58, who holds degrees in law and economics, is a native of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and has held many public and private posts, including <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> service in the early 1970s and president of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> from 1978 to 1985. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> had `` outstanding tenure'' for 3 -LCB- years as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s trade representative. He said <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> will work closely with <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, the new trade representative, to help protect the interests of American farmers during multinational trade talks. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> was confirmed unanimously by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 8 and was officially sworn in as secretary without ceremony later the same day at the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

The audience included senior <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> officials, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, several former secretaries of agriculture and a throng of White House and departmental security people in addition to the news media. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> `` is about to make an enduring commitment to this department, and then told a story about a farmer making a breakfast of eggs and bacon to show the difference between involvement and commitment. `` The chicken is involved, but the pig is committed,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Foreign Visitors to U.S. Up 14 Percent in 1988</HEAD>

 The number of foreign visitors to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> rose 14 percent last year, with much of the increased traffic coming from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the government reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> estimated that visits to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for business and pleasure reached a record 33.7 million in 1988. Tourism is expected to continue to grow in the next two years, but at a slower rate. The agency projects 35.8 million foreign visitors in 1989, up 6 percent from last year, and 37.2 million in 1990, up 4 percent from this year. The biggest share of foreign visits to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> comes from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Some 13.7 million Canadians visited last year, up 10 percent from 1987. Visits by Europeans increased 24 percent last year to 5.8 million, with the increase paced by a 34 percent jump in visits from <LOCATION> Britian </LOCATION>. Visits from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> also were up 24 percent, to 2.6 million. The tourism administration said factors contributing to the increases last year included more aggressive marketing of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> destinations, the cheaper <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar in relation to foreign currencies, and healthy economic conditions abroad. The biggest growth markets for 1989 again are expected to be <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The Japanese government is encouraging citizens to travel abroad as a means of reducing the country's world trade surplus. The tourism administration expects visits from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to increase 22 percent in 1989 to 3.2 million, and visits from <LOCATION> Britian </LOCATION> to increase 13 percent to 2.1 million. Spending by foreign visitors to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was up 26 percent to $ 24.4 billion in 1988, but still was exceeded by the amount spent by Americans traveling abroad, leaving an $ 8.1 billion deficit. That deficit was down 18 percent from the previous year. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> receipts from foreign visitors are expected to rise 11 percent this year to $ 27.1 billion. `` Although we are still in a deficit situation, travel and tourism is our largest service sector export, and the deficit is growing smaller evey year,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Wynegar </PERSON>, director of the tourism administration's Office of Research. The administration, responsible for increasing tourism as an export in international trade, has developed a marketing program to attract a bigger share of the growing numbers of Japanese tourists. `` Now that the Japanese government has developed a program to send more citizens abroad as a means of reducing its worldwide trade surplus, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> must respond quickly to attract its fair share of the market,'' said <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Ollendorff </PERSON>, the agency's director of market development. The program focuses on improving group tours, developing new tours and improving attractions in the cities where most Japanese visitors arrive. Most Japanese prefer group tours, and many enjoy parks, mountain regions and the American West, the administration said.

 Conservation groups asked the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration Thursday to declare the African elephant an endangered species, saying the giant animals could face extinction because of ivory poaching. The Asian elephant is already classed as an endangered species under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law. The African kind is considered only as threatened. Upgrading its status would in effect cut off <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports of ivory, said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Note </PERSON>, who heads Monitor, an association of 32 groups. `` We think the president will be personally interested; he's an outdoorsman,'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Note </PERSON> said. `` We know Secretary of State -LRB- James A. -RRB- <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has taken a personal interest.'' A formal 39-page petition was prepared for presentation to the new secretary of the interior, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. The coalition said there were 1.3 million elephants in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 1981, but are fewer than 500,000 now. `` Experts have predicted that the African elephant may become virtually extinct in as little as 10 years unless ivory poaching is stopped,'' the Humane Society of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said in a statement. `` <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s remaining elephants can not wait,'' the petition said. One major conservation group that did not join in the peititon was the World Wildlife Fund. <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohlen </PERSON>, its senior vice president, said <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> countries would find it offensive if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> banned all imports. `` We do n't think it's the best way to solve the problem,'' he said in a telephone interview. `` We only import 10 percent of the ivory.'' A much larger proportion is imported into <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and stays there, he added. But he said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s imports have dropped and its government is taking drastic new measures to import only legal ivory. <PERSON> Bohlen </PERSON> said he favored a trial period for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law that went into effect last October, which provides for a halt of ivory imports from any country not trying to control the illegal slaughter of elephants. He said world trade has dropped to 80 tons a year from an an average of 400 to 600 tons.

<HEAD>IRS to Help Americans Abroad Prepare Their Tax Returns</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> announced Thursday that it is sending workers to 143 cities in 80 countries to help Americans abroad prepare their 1988 tax returns. At the same time, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> said it is intensifying efforts to reduce the number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens living abroad who do n't even bother to file a return. The agency estimates 3 million live in foreign countries, including retirees and dependents with no income, but only 900,000 filed returns last year. `` We feel there is a big tax gap there,'' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Houck </PERSON>, assistant commissioner for international operations, told reporters. Later this year, <PERSON> Houck </PERSON> said, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> expects to have in operation a computer program that will match the names of Americans applying for passports against the master list of those filing returns. Those who receive passports but do n't file will have to explain why. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> provided mail, telephone or on-the-spot assistance to about one-third of those Americans abroad who filed returns last year. An estimated 5,000 volunteers trained by the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> helped 30,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxpayers stationed at foreign military installations. <PERSON> Houck </PERSON> said that because of budgetary restraints, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> had to postpone opening a toll-free telephone assistance line for Americans abroad. The line will be opened, starting in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, in 1991, he said. Many Americans working in a foreign country may avoid tax on up to $ 70,000 earned each year, if they spend enough time abroad, but they still are required to file a return. <PERSON> Houck </PERSON> cautioned that the exclusion is not available to employees of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government or to members of the military. Independent contractors who supply services to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government may be eligible for the exclusion if they meet certain requirements. But the exclusion is not available to workers who are paid from non-appropriated funds, such as employees of service clubs or military post exchanges. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> estimates there are as many as 40,000 such employees. The agency has assessed additional taxes averaging $ 4,000 against more than 600 who erroneously claimed the foreign-earnings exclusion. <PERSON> Houck </PERSON> said these audits have the potential for $ 30 million in deficiencies. Schedules for the visit of <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> employees to foreign countries are posted in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies and consulates and, for military personnel, with the office of the judge advocate general.

 Media and volunteer service organizations announced on Thursday a national campaign to encourage more Americans to volunteer to help young people. The campaign, called `` Unsung Americans,'' will use television and radio public service messages in conjunction with a referral service to direct citizens to local volunteer agencies. `` There is every indication that the time is ripe for this kind of an effort, given the emphasis on volunteerism in this country,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, president of communications for Capital Cities @ <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. He pointed to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call for increased volunteerism in connection with his `` thousand points of light'' theme. The Unsung Americans campaign will build upon experience gained from <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s partnership with the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in Project Literacy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, or PLUS, an effort launched in December 1985 to raise awareness of the problem of illiteracy in this country. `` Studies have shown a strong correlation, a real link, between the lack of basic skills among young people and the major problems that they face today _ teen pregnancy, dropping out of school, substance abuse, unemployment and delinquency,'' <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> told a news conference. He noted that `` raising basic skills is a key entry point to creating solutions to these problems. It is not a panacea, but it is an important and a fundamental approach.'' Other organizations joining with <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and PBS in the Unsung Americans campaign include: _ VOLUNTEER, a national volunteer group based in suburban <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, that aims to stimulate and strengthen volunteer citizen involvement _ <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> the </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, an interstate compact that helps state leaders improve the quality of education _ <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collaboration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, made up of 15 national youth-serving organizations that banded together to help improve conditions affecting young people _ <ORGANIZATION> Contact </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, located in <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, which operates a national telephone referral service for dealing with various social problems The Unsung Americans public service messages on TV and radio will utilize a toll-free number, 1-800-228-8813. Viewers and listeners calling the number for information will be referred by the Contact Center to volunteer organizations in their own communities. Former <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Romney </PERSON>, chairman of VOLUNTEER, said the Unsung Americans effort was timely because `` volunteering is the most effective and least costly way of solving problems. There is no substitute for the caring volunteer who is capable and willing to help another individual, with a problem, to help themselves.'' He added that `` experience has shown that the most effective way of saving a teen-ager headed down the wrong road _ toward crime or drug abuse _ is to introduce in their life a caring adult role model. It is not just an answer, it is the only answer.''

 Anti-apartheid leaders gave an unprecedented rebuke to <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> on Thursday, saying she has betrayed the trust of the black community and kept bodyguards who waged a `` reign of terror'' in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>. The influential activists accused Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, wife of jailed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and once called the `` Mother of the Nation,'' of `` violating human rights ... in the name of the struggle against apartheid.'' The strongly worded statement was the first public repudiation of Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> by the senior leadership of the anti-apartheid movement. They accused her of complicity in the abduction and assault of a 14-year-old black activist, <PERSON> Stompie </PERSON> <PERSON> Seipei </PERSON>, whose decomposed body was found dumped in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> last month. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, in the few public statements she has made, denied she was at home when the teen-ager and four men were abducted to her house on Dec. 29 by members of a so-called soccer team known as <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> who act as her unofficial bodyguards. But she has defended the abduction, saying the four were taken to protect them from sexual abuse at a Methodist church residence where they were staying in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>. The church has denied the charge, and the anti-apartheid leaders made their denunciation of Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebina </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said from the organization's <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, headquarters that <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leaders were concerned at reports linking Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> with the boy's death. Asked if Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> was present when <PERSON> Stompie </PERSON> was abducted, <PERSON> Sebina </PERSON> said: `` Everybody at home believes so.'' The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> has called on Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> to disband the soccer team. Leaders of the banned <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest opposition coalition, joined prominent anti-apartheid lawyers and officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions, the largest black labor federation, in reaffirming their allegiance to <LOCATION> Mandela </LOCATION> while distancing themselves from his wife <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayob </PERSON>, said he did not believe his client had been informed of the statement. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, 70, has been imprisoned since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white-run government. `` We are outraged at Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s complicity in the recent abductions and assault of <PERSON> Stompie </PERSON>,'' the anti-apartheid leaders said. `` Had <PERSON> Stompie </PERSON> and his three colleagues not been abducted by Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s ` football team,' he would have been alive today. Police this week identified <PERSON> Stompie </PERSON>'s body in a <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> morgue and opened a murder investigation when stab wounds were found in his neck. Police also are investigating the murders of a <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> member found hacked to death in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> this week, and a prominent anti-apartheid physician who reportedly saw <PERSON> Stompie </PERSON> after he had been beaten. Maj.-Gen. <PERSON> Jaap </PERSON> <PERSON> Joubert </PERSON>, who is heading the investigations, said police also are looking for two young <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> men who have been missing since November, after last being seen in the company of members of the soccer team The investigations are the latest in a series of controversies involving Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, 54, in the three years since the government removed all restrictions on her activities and ended the ban on quoting her. Many black activists used to call her `` Mother of the Nation,'' but her erratic behavior and reluctance to consult with black leaders have alienated many supporters. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has abused the trust and confidence which she has enjoyed over the years,'' said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Morobe </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. `` Numerous efforts have been made to reconcile the conflict between Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and the -LRB- black -RRB- community,'' he said. `` On every occasion Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has refused to cooperate and has chosen to disregard the sentiments of the community.'' <LOCATION> Morobe </LOCATION> noted that Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has faced severe hardships, such as being separated from her husband for 27 years, raising her two daughters alone, living under harsh police restrictions, and spending 18 months in solitary confinement without charge. He said it had been painful for black leaders to speak out against Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, and conceded the government would use the criticism as a `` propaganda point.'' But he said her actions repeatedly violated the `` spirit and ethos'' of the anti-apartheid movement, which seeks to end <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s system of legalized race discrimination. `` We are outraged by the reign of terror that the team has been associated with,'' <PERSON> Morobe </PERSON> said. `` Not only is Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> associated with the team, in fact, the team is her own creation.'' Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> he has `` a high regard'' for Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and hoped that something could be done to reconcile her with the <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> community. Although the allegations about abduction and assault have not been proven in court, <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said, `` Enough has surfaced to make it evident that there is enough truth to make it uncomfortable.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> issued no response to the denunciation, would not take phone calls, and refused to talk to journalists who went to her <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> office.

 President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won a decisive majority in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> after an election campaign in which more than 1,000 people were killed, according to results announced Thursday. `` The people have exercised their vote in the face of great adversity. The people have totally rejected the path of violence,'' the president said shortly after the results of Wednesday's vote were announced. Despite death threats and assassinations by Sinhalese extremists and Tamil separatists trying to halt the elections, about 63 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 9.3 million eligible voters cast ballots. `` This is the spirit that will restore democracy,'' <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> said in a nationally televised speech. `` The time for national reconstruction has begun. The agenda is clear: We must restore law and order.'' His party won 125 seats in the 225-member Parliament. The chief opposition group, former Prime Minister <PERSON> Sirimavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, captured 67 seats, Tamils won 23 seats, and the rest went to small parties and independents. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>, who won presidential elections two months ago, failed to secure the two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution and key laws. That could hamstring legislation needed to implement his ambitious anti-poverty program, which he considers vital for ending sectarian violence that has killed at least 10,000 people in the past six years. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON> and the majority of their followers are Sinhalese, the largest ethnic group on this <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island. Comprising 75 percent of the country's 16 million people, the Sinhalese dominate the government, military and economic infrastructure. Tamils, a minority of 18 percent, claim they are discriminated against, and the most radical members of their community have been waging a separatist war since 1983. The Tamil winners included 13 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Eeelam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION>, a former underground militia that was involved in the guerrilla war. Soldiers and police enforced a strict curfew imposed Thursday morning after Sinhalese extremists shot and killed five Sri Lankan soldiers and wounded four policemen in attacks on army and police posts in southern and central <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. Police blamed the attacks on the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, composed of militant Sinhalese who believe the government has made too many concessions to Tamils. The police blamed 47 of the 56 election-day killings on the front. They said security forces killed seven Sinhalese extremists who tried to attack polling places, and they blamed the other two deaths on Tamil guerrillas. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s party, which held 139 of the old <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s 168 seats, scored most of its heaviest victories in its ethnic constituency, the Sinhalese heartland. It captured only one seat in Northern province, which is almost totally Tamil. It won five seats in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> province </LOCATION>, where the population is about evenly divided among Sinhalese, Tamils and Moslems.

 Anti-abortion activists who unsuccessfully fought to block an abortion on a comatose woman continue to press their case, hoping they can win the war even though they lost the battle. They persisted this week in asking the full <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for a stay, even though <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>'s pregnancy was terminated after Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> refused to intervene. The activists hope eventually to argue the merits of the case before the justices `` so that something like the <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> case can not happen again,'' said one of the attorneys in the case, <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON>. `` I hurt in my gut because of the loss of that infant,'' said <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON>. It was not the first time <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON> has become involved in a headline-making right-to-life case. In 1983, he tried, also without success, to intervene in a parental decision in the case of a severely deformed <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> infant known as Baby <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>. He vowed that the setback in the <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> case will not stop him, and like many abortion opponents he is hopeful that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will reverse its 1973 decision legalizing abortion. Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, a 32-year-old free-lance fashion designer from <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brookville </LOCATION>, fell into a coma after suffering brain damage in a car accident Dec. 13. Her husband, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, was told by doctors that she would have a better chance of survival if the fetus she was carrying was aborted. When <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> went to court, seeking guardianship of his wife so he could authorize an abortion, <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON> represented <LOCATION> Syosset </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> in an opposing petition for guardianship of the fetus. Another abortion opponent, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Short </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Farmingdale </LOCATION>, and attorney <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Spaulding </PERSON> took a different legal tack, seeking guardianship of Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>. <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>, <PERSON> Short </PERSON> and their lawyers were able to delay the abortion three times with appeals. At each step, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> courts rejected their petitions, until a last-ditch plea to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for an emergency stay was refused. The abortion was performed Saturday on Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, who was 18 weeks pregnant. Along the way, the anti-abortion activists and their attorneys weathered severe criticism, including abusive, anonymous messages left on <PERSON> Short </PERSON>'s answering machine. At one point during the legal struggle, <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said: `` Our family is beaten down. We're torn up. These strangers have come off the street and are intruding in our lives. We do n't know what to do about it.'' The Appellate Division of state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> agreed, saying, `` These absolute strangers to the <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> family, whatever their motivation, have no place in the midst of this family tragedy.'' <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Short </PERSON> said they sympathized with the <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> family _ the couple also have a 3-year-old child _ and respect their privacy. But both said they could not condone abortion by being silent. `` We have a much larger family _ the human family,'' said <PERSON> Short </PERSON>. `` I do n't care what they call me,'' <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON> said in an interview. <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON>, a father of six and grandfather of 24, said he became involved in the anti-abortion movement in 1970, when <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> legalized abortion. `` My sister, who died of cancer in 1977, urged me to get in and try to protect the rights of those who can not protect themselves,'' said <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON>. `` I've been doing it ever since.'' He gained wide recognition in 1983 in the case of Baby <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>. The infant's parents opted against surgery for her; <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON>, convinced that the parents were refusing surgery because they wanted the child to die, took them to court. Eventually, the state's highest court, the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, sided with the parents and dismissed <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON>'s suit as `` distressing and offensive.'' The parents agreed to the surgery months later, and the child is still alive. <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON> has had some success in court. In 1980, he helped persuade the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to uphold the power of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to withhold federal funds for abortion unless the life of the mother is threatened by the pregnancy. Short has his own long record of anti-abortion activism. In 1972, he was fired as an accountant for <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> after he refused to process Medicaid claims for elective abortions at the county medical center. In 1975, <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON> represented Short in a suit against the <ORGANIZATION> Nassau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. The suit claimed the hospital allowed doctors to perform abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy and let the fetuses die, which hospital officials denied. As a result of the case, a federal judge appointed Short legal guardian of any live fetus at the medical center, a guardianship he never has exercised. `` I see myself as the godfather of the unwanted,'' said <PERSON> Short </PERSON>, father of five. `` Whenever we see anyone being forced into a tragedy we have to stand up and be counted,'' he said. `` The most terrible tragedy is someone killing their own child.''

<HEAD>Mother Claims Cupcakes Rejected Because of AIDS Fear</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A woman who baked 106 Valentine's Day cupcakes for her sons' classmates said school officials turned away the treats because they feared the spread of AIDS, but officials denied her claim. <PERSON> Edwina </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatzenbuehler </PERSON> said she was first told by the kindergarten teacher of her son <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>'s class at <ORGANIZATION> Monroe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> that the cupcakes had to be declined for `` health reasons.'' She said <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Corrine </PERSON> <PERSON> Law </PERSON> later told her the school had a policy against distribution of homemade food, possibly because it could have been made in a `` dirty house'' and threatened spread of diseases such as AIDS. `` Everybody in that school knows me,'' <PERSON> Hatzenbuehler </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` It really just hurt my feelings. I told her you ca n't spread AIDS by cupcakes. Law denied mentioning AIDS or `` dirty'' houses when explaining the policy to Hatzenbuehler, but said the policy resulted from general concerns about health. Store-bought food is allowed because preparation is supervised by health agencies, Law said. There is no scientific evidence that the AIDS virus can be transmitted through food, said <PERSON> Faith </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a senior communicable disease specialist for the AIDS unit of the <ORGANIZATION> Riverside </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring. Law said the school's policy, adopted last September, was a decision by the school staff and Parent-Teacher Association. Besides health considerations, parents showing up with homemade goodies were disrupting instruction, Law said. Distribution of store-bought treats has been put under the coordination of room mothers, the principal said. Hatzenbuehler is not a room mother. `` We try very hard not to offend any parent, but we have to ... act on what is best for the children,'' said <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shurtliff </PERSON>, assistant superintendent for the Riverside Unified School District.

 <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, an ornithologist whose name was adopted for the fictional British agent 007 in <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>'s novels, has died. He was 89. He died Tuesday at <LOCATION> Chestnut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where officials refused to release the cause of death. <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, former curator of ornithology at the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, was the leading authority on birds of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indies </LOCATION> for more than half a century and is best known scientifically for proving that birds of the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> originated in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, not <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. In recognition of this discovery, the geographic line dividing <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> birds of North American ancestry from those of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> origins has been called `` Bond's Line.'' <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>'s contribution to popular culture came after World War II when <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> saw his book, `` Birds of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indies </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>, a bird watcher, was writing a thriller at the time and adopted the name for the dashing character portrayed in movies by <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Connery </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and other actors. `` It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> was born,'' <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> wrote years later to <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Fanning </PERSON> <PERSON> Wickham </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>. `` In return I can only offer you or <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> unlimited use of the name <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> for any purposes you may think fit,'' he wrote. `` Perhaps one day your husband will discover a particularly horrible species of bird which he would like to christen in an insulting fashion by calling it <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> died in 1964.

 <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers said today a plan worked out between Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and prosecutors would `` impose intolerable burdens'' in the Iran-Contra case, but the independent counsel prosecuting <PERSON> North </PERSON> denied the assertion. North's attorneys, <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, filed a motion seeking rejection of the plan to protect classified material detailed Wednesday by independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. Under that plan, drawn up to reflect a court order issued Tuesday by U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, the independent counsel said he will, if necessary, seek an affidavit from the attorney general to prevent the disclosure by North of classified information that could harm national security. The defense motion was filed a few hours after Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> lifted an order that had delayed the start of the trial. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said he is satisfied with arrangements for handling state secrets that <PERSON> North </PERSON> wants to make public. `` The court's oral ruling and its subsequent written order were clearly intended to exclude the AG -LRB- attorney general -RRB- entirely from the trial process,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said in their motion. They said that each time the court rules admissible an item of information falling within nine categories specified by the judge's order, `` the trial will come to a halt'' while <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> sends word to <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> North's lawyers said <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s plan contemplates that <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> would be permitted to intervene in the trial through `` bits and pieces of affidavit,'' an approach that the judge rejected Tuesday. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s plan would `` cripple'' <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s right to cross-examine prosecution witnesses and to present his case and `` would impose intolerable burdens on the court, the witnesses, and the jurors,'' they contended. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> did not comment on <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s plan. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said in a response that the `` independent counsel does not contemplate the trifling ` bits and pieces' activity by the attorney general'' which <PERSON> North </PERSON> anticipates, adding: `` The day-to-day conduct of this case will be by the independent counsel and only the independent counsel.'' Meantime, he called a closed hearing this afternoon to discuss disclosures of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's offer of inducements to third countries to funnel support to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels during a time when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had banned aid to them. At the hearing, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> was to consider the proposed text of what the government is willing to admit at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial about the quid pro quo arrangements, which defense lawyers say are at `` the heart of the case.'' On Monday, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> asserted that then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> personally participated in a plan to offer favors to third countries willing to support the Contras and that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and other top administration officials then agreed to cover up the arrangements. The government is willing to make limited disclosures about the matter, but <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers want to delve into it in greater detail at his trial. <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>, in a brief order this morning, lifted a stay he had granted the government on Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says adequate safeguards to prevent disclosure of national security secrets at the trial are in place and there no longer is a need to hold up the proceedings. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> on Wednesday accepted an order from <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> barring the attorney general from filing affidavits continuously during the trial objecting to individual pieces of classified material that <PERSON> North </PERSON> wants to introduce in his defense. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> made it easier for <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> to accept <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s order. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> devised a plan saying that he will, if necessary, seek an affidavit from the attorney general to prevent the disclosure during the trial of classified information that could harm national security. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s statement added that he `` is prepared to discharge his responsibility'' under <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s order. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s promise `` provides the government with the substance of what we have been seeking for the past week.'' As he left work, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> told reporters he was satisfied because `` the independent counsel has agreed to be my representative'' on all secrecy matters in the trial. Late Wednesday, Acting Solicitor General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryson </PERSON> filed papers asking that the stay issued by <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> be lifted. `` In light of the district court's order and the report of the independent counsel, the attorney general believes that the concerns that gave rise to the relief from this court have been satisfied,'' the department said in its brief. North is accused of shredding evidence and lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to cover up the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's attempts to help the Nicaraguan Contra rebels during a period in which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had banned direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. py

<HEAD>Letters, Papers From Howard Hughes To Be Auctioned</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Letters from <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> to a onetime key aide and other items linked to the late billionaire will go on the auction block this weekend in what is billed as the first sale of its kind. Most of the memorabilia to be sold belonged to the late R.C. <PERSON> Kuldell </PERSON>, who tended to the business of <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> during the late 1930s while his young and flamboyant boss was in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> making movies and headlines. `` While <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> was out playing, <PERSON> Kuldell </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> making money hand over fist for him,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, owner of the company handling the sale. About 65 items will be auctioned at <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>'s auction house Sunday. Besides the <PERSON> Kuldell </PERSON> items, the sale will include a shotgun that the <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, an industrialist, aviation pioneer and film producer, is said to have carried with him on a record-breaking, round-the-world airplane flight in 1938, a hat and scarf he purportedly once wore, several rare posters of movies he made and three schoolbooks he used as a child. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> led a much-publicized life as a young man, but he later became obsessively reclusive. He died in 1976 at age 70 while on a chartered flight from <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> for medical treatment. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said a letter from <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> signed simply `` Howard'' sold for $ 1,000 at an auction in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> three years ago, but there has not been a public sale that consisted exclusively of <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> memorabilia. Notarized letters will support the authenticity of <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' link to all the items, most which are owned by <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> entrepreneur <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuldell </PERSON>, R.C.'s son, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. The elder <PERSON> Kuldell </PERSON> died in 1973. `` I thought other people could use these things more than I could right now,'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuldell </PERSON> said in explaining why he decided to sell. R.C. <PERSON> Kuldell </PERSON> was hired by <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' father, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, and went to work for <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tool </ORGANIZATION>, now <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, in 1920. He continued to work there after the elder <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> died in 1924 and 18-year-old <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> became his boss. `` Dad had a very good rapport with <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>,'' the younger <PERSON> Kuldell </PERSON> said. `` He loved him like a son.'' R.C. <PERSON> Kuldell </PERSON> retired from <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tool </ORGANIZATION> in 1939 at age 52, after a corporate power struggle with a Hughes adviser, his son said. But <PERSON> Kuldell </PERSON> kept in touch with <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> until his death in 1973, his son said. One of the items to be auctioned is a solid gold, custom-made pocket watch <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> gave to <PERSON> Kuldell </PERSON> with both men's initials inscribed on the back. <PERSON> Kuldell </PERSON>'s son said `` he treasured that watch more than anything.'' Ordinarily, such a watch would sell for at least $ 10,000, but it is expected to fetch a higher price because of the history behind it, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. In all, the items could bring as much as $ 100,000, he said. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said that after word got out about the auction, several other people called wanting to sell their Hughes memorabilia. One consigner is selling three schoolbooks that belonged to <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, found in an attic of a home 40 years ago. Folded up in one of the books is a drawing of a boy in a car that has an airplane propeller on the end. And in one composition book, an 8-year-old <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> writes about his 1913 Christmas. `` I hung my stocking and tried to make mother hang hers up, but she would not do it. I went to bed but could not go to sleep for a long time. I got up the next day and went downstairs. I thought there was too much for me. I had a nice Christmas.'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> expects about 500 people to attend the auction.

<HEAD>Corncob Fibers To Be Processed Into Fiber Boost For Food</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The fibers that keep corn on the cob, best known for sticking between the teeth, will soon be marketed to give a fiber boost to bread, snacks and other foods. <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pulaski </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION>, using a process developed by government scientists, plans to make high-fiber flour from the corncob material in about six months. `` Our product has the ability to go into any food _ pudding, ice cream, all baked goods, even junk food,'' said company President <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinfort </PERSON>. `` Anywhere you want to increase fiber and reduce calories. The potential is astronomical.'' The new process will create a market for part of the corn plant that farmers produce, but do n't sell, said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> scientist who helped develop the process at a laboratory in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>. The treated fiber is dried and ground and used to replace some of the conventional flour in breads, cakes and doughnuts. The material could increase the fiber content of baked goods by up to 30 percent without altering the taste or adding calories, <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> said. `` We found we could make a white bread that looks, feels and tastes like any other white bread but which has as much dietary fiber as whole wheat bread,'' he said. Soluble fibers, such as those found in oat bran and most fruits, have been linked with lower blood cholesterol levels, according to <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Behall </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> nutritionist in <LOCATION> Beltsville </LOCATION>, Md. The fiber in corncobs, and in most brans, is insoluble, `` but insoluble fiber is known to reduce likelihood and severity of constipation, diverticulitis and irritable bowel syndromes such as colitis,'' she said. <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> said the process involves the use of hydrogen peroxide to soften fibrous plant material and make it more palatable. Otherwise, consumers complain that the fiber creates a gritty texture, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pulaski </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION>, which paid a $ 50,000 fee for the technology, expects to buy corncobs and other plant material from farmers near its headquarters in <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pulaski </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. The company already processes corncobs into a material used in polishing agents and other industrial products.

 Reading from notes at the beginning of his meeting with the press, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` We support the Afghan efforts to fashion a stable, broadly based government responsive to the needs of the Afghan people.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today that Americans `` have to be wary'' of Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s promise to provide fair and free elections in exchange for the breakup of the Contra rebel fighting force. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he did see `` some positive elements'' in an agreement worked out by <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and the leaders of four other Central American nations. Noting that the Central American leaders gave themselves 90 days to work out the details of the peace pact, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has time to analyze the situation and make strategy decisions. The president hailed elements of the agreement that committed the Sandinista government to instituting freedom of worship, freedom of speech and fair elections. But he said there are `` some troublesome elements.'' `` What's troubling me is that ... claims like this have been made at one time, only to see those claims repudiated. Promises made and promises broken,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` So I think we have to be wary. ... Let's be sure that we not leave the resistance standing alone, leave them twisting down there without fulfillment of the methods of democracy on the part of the Sandinistas.'' The president commented in an Oval Office interview with a small group of reporters, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, had voiced skepticism about the peace plan earlier. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> joined <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials in noting that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials will soon be discussing the situation with the leaders of Central American democracies. Asked whether the administration would seek a renewal of humanitarian aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, which expires March 31, the spokesman said only that `` no decisions have been made at this point.'' He acknowledged, however, that the decision on whether such aid should continue would ultimately rest with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He did say that `` there certainly is a fundamental continuing commitment to the Contras.'' Meanwhile, the revised peace plan signed by five Central American leaders is producing signs of a new conservative-liberal split in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> over what to do about the Contras. The two key elements of the agreement, reached Tuesday after a two-day summit in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, call for early demobilization of the Contra rebels and fair national elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> no later than February 1990. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it is withholding comment on the plan until it consults with the Central American countries other than <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>: <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. But two key members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who have long been on opposite sides of the Contra debate offered sharply differing assessments Wednesday of the communique, which calls for a <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> demobilization plan to be formulated within 90 days. Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Okla </LOCATION>., a Contra backer, argued against the sequence outlined in the agreement, saying the elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> should be held before the Contras disband `` If they lay down their arms -LRB- now -RRB- there wo n't be elections,'' said <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, who has been a Republican floor leader during previous Contra aid debates. He said it was important to keep the Contras `` together and armed until there is democracy.'' But Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonier </PERSON>, D-Mich., the chief deputy majority whip, expressed hope that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will look favorably upon the plan Alluding to the Sandinista promise of free elections and other liberalizing measures, <PERSON> Bonier </PERSON> said, `` I think this is what the Contra forces in essence have been asking. I think it presents a unique opportunity for them to take advantage of it.'' <PERSON> Bonier </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> economic and political pressure has proved effective in inducing the Sandinistas to undertake democratic reforms but `` every time we have applied military pressure, there has been a constricting of freedoms.'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bonier </PERSON> were interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION>'s McNeil-Lehrer NewsHour. Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, meanwhile, questioned whether there was an `` enforcement mechanism'' which would ensure that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> make a good faith effort to carry out their democratic promises. If <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> reneges, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said in a radio interview, `` we're going to have to regroup and come up with a new strategy to move <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in the direction of pluralism. Contra leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> appeared to have mixed feelings about the agreement, alternately praising and condemning it while talking with reporters in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The noncommittal stance of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> was attributable, in part, to a number of unanswered questions about the meaning of the communique and the motives of the four presidents friendly to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in signing it, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. One official, insisting on anonymity, said the communique appears to mean that `` we are two steps closer to the final killing of the Contras.'' About 11,000 rebels are clustered in camps on the Honduran side of the border with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, where they are sustained by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> humanitarian aid program. Congressional critics of the Contras are likely to insist, as their price for additional's `` infamous book'' has had `` appalling consequences in some Islamic countries.'' `` It is a decree, it is a verdict after careful consideration,'' he said of the death sentence. `` It has nothing to do with any particular country.'' On Wednesday, protesters stoned the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> reopened the embassy in December after an eight-year closure, and intended to appoint an ambassador and have more than 12 diplomats, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, an anonymous caller to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> threatened to bomb British flights unless <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> emerged from hiding. At <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> immediately tightened security with bag-by-bag searches of luggage of passengers on its Thursday evening flights to the Indian sub-continent and the Far East. Air <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, another British-owned airline with flights to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, said it was taking the threat seriously. Amid a growing international furor, the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> government called in the British and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ambassadors and demanded that all copies of the book be destroyed. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and several other countries banned the book. Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> reached agreement with her right-wing opposition in January on a parliamentary resolution upholding the ban. <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said religious figures in the northwestern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Urumiyeh </LOCATION> said in a statement, `` We have already put on our death shrouds and pledge to carry out the Imam's -LRB- <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s -RRB- death sentence against <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> and his publishers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' The broadcast followed reports that other death squads were headed to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> from Islamic countries in search of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, a 41-year-old Moslem. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> dropped out of sight soon after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> announced the death sentence on Tuesday on him and <PERSON> Viking </PERSON>, his publishers in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The $ 2.6 million bounty offered by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was matched by <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashemian </PERSON>, religious leader in the southwestern city of <LOCATION> Kerman </LOCATION>, who offered the cash reward `` to any group or individual who carries out the death sentence on <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> and his publishers.'' That brought the total bounty to $ 5.6 million. Non-Iranians would be paid $ 1 million if they got to <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> first. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was `` appalled by the death threats against <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> by the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, as well as a subsequent offer of a reward for his murder.'' `` Such threats are completely irresponsible and are incompatible with basic standards of international conduct,'' he said, adding that he did not see how `` this in any way could improve the prospects'' for U.S.-Iranian relations. In the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, where he is on a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> tour, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> called the death threats `` regrettable.'' <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hossam-el-Din </PERSON>, a leading Islamic theologian in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> erred in sending death squads after <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> because executing him would be `` virtually impossible'' under the tenets of Islam. <PERSON> Hossam-el-Din </PERSON> said in an interview that nobody has been executed in <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s 1,350-year history as an apostate, which he interpreted as the crime that <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> invoked in issuing his sentence against <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> said only that the Indian-born author deserved to die for insulting Islam. In other developments: _ The <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> government said it was `` shocked'' at the death threat and Dutch Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> den </PERSON> <PERSON> Broek </PERSON> canceled a trip to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. _ Italian publishers <ORGANIZATION> Arnoldo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mondadori </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spa </ORGANIZATION> said they would go head with a contract to release the Italian edition of `` The Satanic Verses,'' but <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s French publishers, <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourgois </PERSON>, suspended publication plans. _ The <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, backing earlier protests by British writers, denounced the threats against <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> and his publishers as contrary to the `` tolerance and understanding that are the hallmark of a free society.''

<HEAD>Politicians Split on New Dialogue with Palestinians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Supporters of a new dialogue between liberal Israelis and Palestinians said Thursday it could lead to negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, but some right-wing opponents view those involved as traitors. The controversy has created new tensions in the uneasy governing coalition of Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s conservative <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc and the more dovish <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Two private meetings were held this week by three prominent Palestinans who support the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and leading <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members close to Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, the party leader. Liberal parliament members and other Israelis opposed to the government policy of refusing to talk with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> also have flown to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to participate in academic forums, debates and conferences with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials. At least four conferences are scheduled in the coming weeks. Such forums skirt an Israeli law making contact with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> punishable by up to three years in jail. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> hinted that he may join the informal discussions later despite opposition within his party. <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Burg </PERSON>, a Labor dove who attended one of the meetings, would not reveal what was discussed but said one aim of the dialogue was to `` create an awareness'' that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> could not ignore the Palestinians. `` We both suffered from an on-going process of demonization of the enemy,'' he said. `` I want the Israelis to realize that something is going on, and ... that we have no excuse any more to say there is nobody to talk to.'' <PERSON> Galia </PERSON> <PERSON> Golan </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor who attended a conference with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> last week, found it `` very encouraging'' and said: `` They have come to the conclusion they must negotiate, and must limit their demands. They've come a long way.'' <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, a Palestinian who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and is close to <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, said he joined the talks to explain <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> positions so they would seem less threatening to Israelis. `` It is time to go and talk to these people, and let them see the monster face to face, and see he is not a monster,'' he said Tuesday, adding that he wants the meetings to involve other than leftist Israelis. `` Palestinians are accepting the idea of meeting with Israelis more close to the center,'' he said. <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, 48, is the scion of a prominent <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> family. His father was a military commander and his grandfather mayor of the city. Also involved in the talks with Israeli politicials were <PERSON> Ziad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziad </PERSON>, a journalist, and philosphy professor <PERSON> Sari </PERSON> <PERSON> Nusseibah </PERSON>. Right-wing members of the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s parliament, attacked the dialogue with Palestinians and <PERSON> Eliezer </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldman </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Tehiya </LOCATION> party said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> participants should be tried for `` working with the enemies of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON>, spokesman for the prime minister, said: `` We do n't consider these meetings as important On the contrary, it will not come to anything.'' Of the Israelis involved, he said: `` These people are not in charge of making policy for the state.'' Some contacts with Palestinian supporters of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> have been made by defense officials and senior army officers as part of an initiative by Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> hawk. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> raised the possibility Thursday of negotiating for an undefined `` political entity'' with elected Palestinians from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where an uprising began more than 14 months ago. He promised `` really free elections ... to choose political representation to conduct negotiations with us on a political process that would not immediately reach a permanent solution. We ca n't resolve that problem at once.'' Speaking on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Arabic television program, <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> indicated flexibility about withdrawing the army from voting areas on election days and providing guarantees that no one would interefere with voting. He promised to force a Cabinet vote if Palestinians accepted his proposal, even with reservations. Many Palestinians suspect, however, that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is trying to create an unacceptable local alternative to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s leadership. `` The Israelis, in their rejection of talking to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, are trying to find someone else to talk to,'' said <PERSON> Haidar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Shafi </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. `` They are trying to dismember the Palestinians in the territories from those outside.'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>'s intitiative appears to have been the genesis of the unofficial talks between <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> doves. <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> met with <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Shmuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Goren </PERSON> while still in jail last month. <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> had been in jail without trial during most of the Palestinian uprising, suspected of involvement in underground activities.

<HEAD>Doctor Who Posed For Norman Rockwell Retires After Half-Century of
Practice</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A small-town doctor who made house calls for more than a half-century and was a model for one of the best-loved works of illustrator <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> retired on his 83rd birthday Thursday. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said he knew it was time to quit because he had begun forgetting people's names. He made his last house call Wednesday, his last day of work. `` There's nothing more disgusting than when your memory starts to go,'' he said. `` Makes you feel like a horse's ` patootie.''' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> was the only doctor in this picturesque western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> community, <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION>'s hometown. He said he has arranged for a few physicians in neighboring communities to take over his patient load. The doctor did his own laboratory work and developed his own X-rays between examinations in his cluttered office on West Main Street. On Thursday the telephone in the office rang off the hook with patients begging him to stay on. He practiced obstetrics, pediatrics, gynecology, dermatology, orthopedics and gerontology, and worked even after supper on most days, seeing 13 patients on Monday. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> was medical examiner until this week, but planned to keep on the town board of health. He also planned, he said, to devote his time to his four daughters and to continue to lend an ear to patients who stop him on the street in this town of 2,000 people. His wife, <PERSON> Anna </PERSON>, died last month. <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON>, a patient of <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>'s until his death a decade ago, used the doctor as a model for several illustrations, including `` Before the Shot,'' in which a physician prepares a shot for a bare-bottomed youngster as the boy suspiciously examines his framed medical degrees. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said he owned the original but reluctantly sold it for $ 10,000 several years ago to raise money for the financially troubled <ORGANIZATION> Edgecomb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nursing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Convalescent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION>, which he had founded in 1968. <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> sold it for him to a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state doctor whom <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> declined to identify. A charcoal sketch of the painting was on display at the <ORGANIZATION> Norman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> down the street from the doctor until last month. The whereabouts of the original is unknown, the museum said. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said the only memento he has of the artist he described as `` shy, genial, happy and a non-complainer'' was a head study <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> once made of him. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said he charged $ 2 for an office visit and $ 3 for a home visit when he hung out his shingle in 1939 after graduating from <ORGANIZATION> Middlesex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, now <ORGANIZATION> Brandeis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He often took his fee in vegetables, venison or cord wood. It was no way to get rich, he acknowledged, `` unless you mean rich in spirit.''

<TEXT>
 By the year 2020, the world's Moslem population could double, to 1.9 billion, and its share of humanity jump from 18 percent to 25 percent, two population experts said Thursday. Of all the world's religions, they said, <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> is the fastest growing. Writers <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeks </PERSON>, who directs the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Population </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Saad </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadalla </PERSON>, its technical director, said that about 42 babies are born to every 1,000 people in Moslem countries each year. That compares with fewer than 34 in other Third World countries and only 13 in the western industrial world. The study, `` The Demography of Islamic Nations,'' was distributed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Population </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, a private group. Weeks said in a telephone interview that the Moslem growth is due first of all to low incomes, which he said were largely a result of decades of colonial rule in the Islamic world. `` When the economic situation goes up, the fertility rate goes down,'' he said. `` When the status of women goes up, fertility goes down too.'' The study pointed to Islamic countries, particularly <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, where both the economy and the status of women have improved in recent years. It also noted the disadvantages of women in Moslem countries, including the prevalence of teen-age marriages and low levels of education. The authors estimated that 980 million of the world's 5.2 billion people are Moslems. By 2020, they estimated, Moslems will total 1.9 billion people out of roughly 8.6 billion people. <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> has the world's largest Moslem population, 156,136,000, the authors said. Of all Moslem nations, they said, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> has likely made the greatest headway in slowing its population growth. `` The immediate explanation for the drop in fertility was the rapid increase in contraceptive use among married couples of reproductive age,'' the study said. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has the second largest Moslem population, 104,243,000; followed by <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, 93,050,000, and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> with 89,034,000.

<HEAD>Cattle Being Fed for Slaughter at 7.7 Million Head Feb. 1</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cattle being fed for the slaughter market as of Feb. 1 in the seven major beef states totaled 7.7 million head, down 2 percent from a year ago but 5 percent more than inventories of two years ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The placement of new cattle and calves in fattening pens last month was reported at 1.71 million head, up 3 percent from a year ago but 8 percent more than two years ago. Officials said it was the largest January feedlot placement since 1974. Marketings of `` fed'' cattle in January totaled 1.67 million head, down 5 percent from a year ago and down 7 percent from two years ago. As of Feb. 1, feedlot inventories were smaller than a year earlier in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. But <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> showed increases. The seven states produce about three-fourths of the nation's beef. State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the seven states. The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as of Feb. 1, and the second number is the percentage of a year earlier.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said Thursday that Iranian death threats against author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> were `` regrettable.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it was appalled by the threats of the Iranian government, which says <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel `` The Satanic Verses'' is a blasphemy against <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>. While <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> posed for photographs in <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Poos </PERSON>, he was asked about the multimillion-dollar reward offered Wednesday in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for the murder of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, whose novel has sparked violent protest from Islamic fundamentalists. `` I think that is regrettable,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is fundamentally committed to oppose terrorism in all its forms, particularly state-sponsored terrorism.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, was identified with a tough stand on terrorism. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, `` We are appalled by the death threats against <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> by the -LRB- Iranian leader -RRB- <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, as well as a subsequent offer of a reward for his murder.'' `` Such threats are completely irresponsible and are incompatible with basic standards of international conduct,'' he added. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said he did not see how `` this in any way could improve the prospects'' for U.S.-Iranian relations. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> made his comments as he held talks with leaders of the <LOCATION> Benelux </LOCATION> countries and met with <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>, the secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, as he neared the end of an eight-day trip to 15 allied capitals. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> began the day in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, meeting Belgian Prime Minister <PERSON> Wilfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tindemans </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Multiparty elections will be held in spring 1990, official radio said Thursday, about five months after a military coup ended 26 years of one-party rule. Military leader <PERSON> Gen </PERSON>. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> used his forces to suppress nationwide pro-democracy demonstrations in September, saying <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> was heading toward anarchy. But he then promised fair, multiparty elections. The 26-year one-party rule by the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ended when <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, the armed forces chief, took power in a coup on Sept. 18. Thursday night's announcement by the <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> over state radio did not give an exact election date. But it said an election law would be published on March 1, `` 14 months before the actual elections,'' suggesting a date around early May 1990. It said the election campaign would begin three months before the general elections. The mention of a three-month campaign was seen as an indication that the existing ban on public assembly would be lifted and the parties would be allowed to use state radio and television. Registration of political parties began last Sept. 29 and is to close on Feb. 28. So far, 188 parties have registered with the commission.

 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON>, whose plane burned on the tarmac of a remote island in December, was delayed leaving a U.S.-run naval base Thursday when three of his aircraft had engine trouble. <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> and his party boarded a <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> aircraft at <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> naval base for a flight to another installation when the pilot discovered a faulty starter engine and circuit breaker, the <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> and the others waited about 90 minutes until a <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> navy BO-5 helicopter was flown to the base, 50 miles west of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. The helicopter arrived at Subic and <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> boarded. When the pilot revved up the engines, however, the helicopter also developed engine trouble and the takeoff was scrubbed. Officials then telephoned <LOCATION> Villamor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Pasay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to dispatch a third aircraft _ a <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> _ to retrieve <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON>, the news agency said.

Finally, a UH-1 helicopter was sent to <PERSON> Subic </PERSON> and managed to take off with <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> aboard, the agency said. On Dec. 19, a <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> carrying <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> and 17 others caught fire moments after landing at Catarman on Samar island. All passengers escaped without injury but the plane was totally destroyed. One of several helicopters sent to <PERSON> Catarman </PERSON> to fetch <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON>' party developed engine trouble and ditched in the sea. No one was killed.

 A man linked to the military was convicted of assassinating an <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> official, and he was sentenced to life in prison, a judge said Thursday. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Climaco </PERSON> was found guilty Wednesday of `` murder with aggravating circumstances'' after witnesses identified him as the triggerman in the June 24, 1988, slaying of lawyer <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Surigao </PERSON>. <PERSON> Surigao </PERSON> was an official of the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> branch of <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, the international human rights group.

<TEXT>
 A short walk from <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s golf course, impoverished migrant farm workers living on university land are crammed into wretched wooden shacks without heat, toilets or running water `` There are more illegalities, more exploitation of workers, more breaches of workers' rights in this one plot of ground right here than we've seen in a long, long time,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Eggleston </PERSON>, attorney for a university union that the migrants want to represent them. But who is legally responsible for the migrants' plight? Is it the university, which owns the land? Or is it <ORGANIZATION> Webb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranch </ORGANIZATION>, which has leased 300 acres and pays the migrants for picking berries and vegetables that sell to restaurants and markets 30 miles north in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>? The migrants have asked the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, the union for 1,200 university maintenance workers, to represent them. The union sent a letter this week to <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Webb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranch </ORGANIZATION> demanding recognition as the bargaining agent for the farm workers. If <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> do n't recognize the union by Friday, the union plans to file a petition with the state <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> that could lead to a vote by the farm workers on union representation. <PERSON> Eggleston </PERSON> contends <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION>, as land owner, is the true employer of the farm workers under state law and is `` legally responsible for the shameful activity that's going on here.'' <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Priscilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> disagreed. `` Stanford is not responsible for the employment policies of its lessees or contractors,'' she said in a statement. `` We would, of course, be concerned if any lessee violated the law. So far as we know, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranch </PERSON> has not done so. If there are issues of mistreatment, we hope they are brought up with the state.'' <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, manager of the ranch leased by his family since 1922, was not available for comment Thursday, his office said. Other ranch officials would not comment. The migrants' shacks are just a half-mile from the center of what is considered one of the most beautiful college campuses in the nation. Tuition and room and board next school year will total $ 19,164. Up to 90 migrants, including 20 children, live in the encampment. Among them are <PERSON> Tibuecio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabrera </PERSON>, 67, and his wife, <PERSON> Cointa </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON>, 58. <PERSON> Cabrera </PERSON>'s last monthly pay receipt shows he worked 194 hours and earned $ 824.50, or $ 4.25 an hour. He took home $ 514.86 after deductions for Social Security, unemployment tax, a $ 50 personal advance, rent of $ 145.50 and utilities. `` I sometimes get angry, but I have to comfort myself,'' <PERSON> Cabrera </PERSON> said. `` What else can I do?'' <PERSON> Cabrera </PERSON> and his wife have a small electric heater and some blankets to keep warm. They have a hot plate, but there is no sink or water in the room. Clothing hangs from a cord and a bare bulb dangles from a wire tacked to the wall near several pictures of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> and the pope. Like the other workers, <PERSON> Cabrera </PERSON> receives no health care, no holidays and no vacation. He said he had to use all his savings to pay for treatment of a stomach ailment. The camp has only one portable toilet and three indoor toilets. There is a communal kitchen and refrigerators are padlocked between meals. Only a few of the migrants speak or read English. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> charges 75 cents for every hour worked for rent, so the more hours worked the higher the rent. The migrants are charged for the tools they use. The migrants, long afraid to speak out because they were illegal aliens from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, asked the <LOCATION> Stanford </LOCATION> union to represent them after receiving protection under the federal amnesty program for agricultural workers, <PERSON> Eggleston </PERSON> said Wednesday. Other labor groups also are supporting the migrants. `` I think this is a step backward in history,'' said <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulaski </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mateo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's somewhat reminiscent of the company towns, where the employers control people not only at work but at home after work ... <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> is acting like a Third World employer here.''

 Air traffic controllers warned a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> pilot he was on a collision course with another airliner, allowing a hasty turn that averted a possible in-flight crash, authorities said. `` There is an investigation. We did have two aircraft that violated the parameters established for separation,'' <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> confirmed Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jetliners came within 15 seconds of colliding Monday night over <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> after one of the jets was rerouted because a power blackout briefly closed <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION> reported.

<HEAD>Official Newspaper Prints Red Cross Report on Katyn Massacre</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities for the first time allowed an official newspaper to publish evidence that implicates the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the massacre of thousands of Polish officers during World War II. The bodies of more than 4,000 Polish army officers deported to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were uncovered by <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s army in the spring of 1943. Official Soviet and Polish histories have long maintained the officers were murdered by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> in 1941, but many Poles and Western historians blame the Soviets. The <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> massacre, named for the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> where the bodies were found, is one of the most sensitive issues in Polish-Soviet relations. For many Poles, it symbolizes a list of historical grievances against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. A confidential report made by the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> in June 1943 that appeared Wednesday in the weekly Odrodzenie -LRB- Rebirth -RRB- said: `` Judging by the papers found with the corpses, the murder took place in the months of March and April 1940.'' Because the site, 12 miles west of <LOCATION> Smolensk </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, was at that time in possession of the Soviets, the report implied Soviet responsibility for the crime. In an introduction to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> document in <LOCATION> Ordrodzenie </LOCATION>, historian <PERSON> Jarema </PERSON> <PERSON> Maciszewski </PERSON> wrote, `` As it is known, determining the date of the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> murder is at the same time equal to pointing at the perpetrators.'' The Polish officers were deported by the Soviets to camps in the western part of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> after the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> invaded <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in September 1939. <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s army invaded the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in June 1941. Each of the officers, primarily reservists representing the cream of the Polish intelligentsia, was executed with a bullet to the base of the skull. The report published Wednesday was written by <PERSON> Kazimierz </PERSON> <PERSON> Skarzynski </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> during the war, and it was found in <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> archives, <PERSON> Maciszewski </PERSON> wrote. For propaganda reasons, the German occupiers of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> had permitted a <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> team to make a five-week study of the graves. Secreted among the team were representatives of the Polish underground, according to historian <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Zawodny </PERSON>. The conclusions of the investigation have long been known in the West, but the Odrodzenie article said this was the first time the report has been published in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Maciszewski </PERSON> is chairman of the Polish side of an official Soviet-Polish commission appointed in 1987 to investigate the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> massacre and blank spots in history, including the 1920 war between <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the murder of most of the top members of the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s orders in the late 1930s. The commission has yet to publish its conclusions, and Polish officials have said the Soviet side is responsible for the delay. The government Tuesday said that the stand of the Polish historians on the panel may soon be made public separately from those of the Soviet side. Many Poles had hoped Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would mention the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> massacre during a six-day visit to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> last July. While <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> spoke of painful episodes between the two countries in a speech to the Polish Parliament, he made no specific mention of <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> told her son and daughter when they were growing up to stay away from the old brown trunk in the basement. When she died this week, they found the skeletal remains of an infant inside. State medical examiners Thursday set about determining the age, sex and cause of death of the infant, who may have been dead 30 years. There is no evidence so far to suggest that any crime was committed, police said. `` Investigators at the scene, assisted by the state crime laboratory and the medical examiner's office, speculate that the baby was a full-term baby, and was probably a couple of weeks old,'' said state police spokesman Sgt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ireton </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Shields </PERSON>, a 67-year-old widow, died of natural causes Monday in her home in suburban <LOCATION> Elkridge </LOCATION>. The skeleton was found in a steamer trunk Wednesday afternoon by Mrs. <PERSON> Shields </PERSON>' grown daughter and son, who were going through the woman's effects searching for a will, said Trooper <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Davey </PERSON>. `` It was a brown steamer trunk, pushed against the wall in the basement,'' <PERSON> Davey </PERSON> said. `` It had things piled on it and things piled around it.'' The skeleton was found wrapped in two blankets, he said, and an old Bible and remnants of a white dress also were found. <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON>, 31, and her brother, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, 29, told investigators that when they were young, their mother told them never to go near the trunk, <PERSON> Davey </PERSON> said. But not long before she died, she told them to take care of what was in the trunk, the officer said, adding, `` It was their interpretation that it was the will that was in the trunk.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Shields </PERSON>' children, who declined to comment publicly, told investigators there had been no family discussion about a child who died at birth or shortly afterward, <PERSON> Davey </PERSON> said. Nor did they recall their mother ever being pregnant while they were growing up. A search of the home by state police failed to turn up anything to explain the infant's remains, he said, and a check of state records found no mention of any child born to Mrs. <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> from 1950 on, other than <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>. The family had lived in the house in <LOCATION> Elkridge </LOCATION> for about 20 years. Before that they lived in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Davey </PERSON> said. `` As near as they -LRB- the two children -RRB- can recall, when they moved, the trunk went with them,'' he said.

 Theme restaurants that sprinkle sawdust on the floor for a dash of Wild West authenticity won the first round Thursday in a shootout with the <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION>, which calls the practice unsanitary. `` This is regulation gone wild,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> as he voted for a bill overturning the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> sawdust ban. Restaurants with names like the Big Apple and the Satisfied Frog are pushing a bill to overturn the department and allow sawdust as long as it is changed daily and sprinkled with a non-toxic fire retardant. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved the measure Thursday in an 8-4 vote and sent it to the health committee. The feud began in earnest a year ago when state and county health departments cracked the whip on an estimated 25 to 40 restaurants in the state that sprinkled sawdust on the floor.

As for the requirement that sawdust be changed daily, <PERSON> Englender </PERSON> said, with inspections averaging two times a year, `` enforcement obviously would be difficult; compliance would be next to impossible.''

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has delayed until mid-March a decision on letting a major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense contractor work with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to develop and produce a new version of the F-16 fighter, congressional sources said Thursday. Plans to transfer to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> $ 7 billion in advanced American aircraft technology have generated opposition on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> to the deal involving the proposed FSX fighter, which <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> wants to upgrade its air capabilities by the late 1990s. Under the pending agreement, <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> would join forces with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> to co-develop and co-produce the fighter. A congressional source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that after considerable jockeying among agencies, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> were asked to study the strategic, commercial and technological aspects of the project and do a combined report by March 10. The review was ordered at a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting Tuesday night that had been called on less than 24 hours notice, according to the source. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, which had taken the lead in negotiating the FSX agreement, contended that a final decision should be made this month. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, however, had sought a delay of 60 to 90 days. Other agencies, including the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative and the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> departments, also had been leaning toward <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>'s position in favor of a thorough review. During a White House press briefing Thursday, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said only that with regard to the FSX, `` the interagency process is still under way. I would not expect it to come up in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will go to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> next week to attend the funeral of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>. Proponents of the <ORGANIZATION> FSX </ORGANIZATION> deal say it is the best that could be negotiated _ in view of Japanese refusal to buy wholly American-built planes _ and it fosters beneficial technology transfer in both directions with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> while generating income and jobs for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry. But critics contend the agreement amounts to a technological giveaway that will enable the Japanese to compete more effectively against this country in the global aviation market. They argue that <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> should purchase American-made fighters to help offset the $ 50 billion <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. On Capitol Hill, a group of 21 senators last week introduced a resolution declaring they have `` strong reservations'' about the deal and urging a 60-day delay to allow time for a thorough review. General Dynamics, this country's No. 2 defense contractor, has said that under the deal, it and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies will receive 35 percent to 45 percent of the $ 1.2 billion being spent on development of the FSX as well as a comparable share of the $ 5 billion production program.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called budget negotiations a `` two-way street'' on Thursday and denied he was trying to shift to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the responsibility for proposing unpopular cuts. `` I do n't think that is the informed opinion of the key leaders in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He also denied any major policy rift with <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> over interest rates, though he added, `` maybe we'll get into a fight down the road.'' In an interview with a small group of reporters, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was pleased so far with congressional reaction to his $ 1.16 trillion spending plan for fiscal year 1990. `` I said ahead of time I did n't expect everybody would jump up and down and say this is the greatest thing since sliced bread,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` The Republicans have generally been enthusiatic,'' he said. `` The Democrats, though not endorsing it quite as much, have seen some positive direction, some positive objectives, in the budget.'' Some Democratic critics have complained that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> budget, while advocating expanded social programs, is vague on details of what must be cut to pay for the new initiatives. These critics have said the situation allows <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to get credit for new programs to aid education, the homeless and environmental cleanup, while sticking <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with the job of finding cuts in other areas to pay for them. After saying that was n't the view of key leaders, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added that if some people do hold that opinion, `` then we will redouble our efforts to be sure they understand there's no validity to that.'' `` Yes, there's a lot more detail that has to be hammered out. And we will work with them to satisfy their interests, and find out what they want. It's a two way street,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said he was pleased with the reaction so far to his plan to rescue the nation's ailing savings and loans, even though he said that few are thoroughly enamored with it. As for interest rates, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has neen nudging up short-term rates in recent months in an effort to minimize inflation risks. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> has indicated he would rather err on the side of tighter credit than encourage a rekindling of inflation. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Thursday: `` I do n't see the inflationary pressures as so bad, or enough, to warrant substantially higher interest rates. I do n't see that.'' Still, he said he and <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> `` are n't far apart'' and asserted that politicians, bankers and business journalists delight in trying to `` drive a wedge between the president and the charman of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>,'' regardless of who is in power. `` I want to avoid that. ... You know, maybe we'll get into a fight down the road but I do n't think it's at hand.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the `` best thing to do about interest rates is to get a budget agreement.'' He said a budget plan such as the one he unveiled last week would _ if adopted _ help to drive down rates. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has projected that short-term rates _ now at over 8 percent _ will ease to around 7 percent this year and fall to 5.5 percent by 1990. Many private economists have labeled these projections too optimistic. `` The interest rates will be lower if we can promptly get a budget agreement,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> gave unanimous approval Thursday to an independence plan designed to free <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> from 74 years of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> rule, and it dispatched the first <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers to the region. A warm round of applause and handshaking after the vote was a departure from the usual decorum of the council chamber. `` This decision sets in motion the process of transition of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> toward independence through free and fair elections under the supervision and control of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Ambassador <PERSON> Jai </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratap </PERSON> <PERSON> Rana </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, council president for February. `` The decision also marks the last major step toward decolonization. We look forward to welcoming <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> as a fellow member of this family of nations before long.'' April 1 was set as the date to begin the one-year plan for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s transition to a nation ruled by its black majority. The resolution adopted by the 15-member council implements an independence plan for the territory, also known as <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, that has been ready since 1978. Approved along with the resolution was a recent report by Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> on implementation that calls for sending 4,650 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers, 500 police supervisors and at least 1,000 civilian election monitors to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. Which countries will provide personnel for the peacekeeping force has not yet been decided, but <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has offered to send up to 20 election monitors as its first participation in such an effort, an Asian diplomat said. The Namibian independence mission will be called the U.N. Transition Assistance Group, or UNTAG. <PERSON> Martti </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON>, Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>'s special representative for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Fanning </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> UNTAG </ORGANIZATION>'s police unit, was expected in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> on Friday for talks with Gen. <PERSON> Dolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Gouws </PERSON>, the territorial police commissioner <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s police will continue to be responsible for civil order, supervised by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> police. Gen. <PERSON> Dewan </PERSON> <PERSON> Prem </PERSON> <PERSON> Chand </PERSON>, the UNTAG military commander, is to arrive early next week with civilian civilian administrators, <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> has estimated UNTAG will cost $ 416 million in its first year. That would make it the most expensive <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping mission since the Belgian <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION> operation of 1960-64, which cost more than $ 400 million and involved 19,828 soldiers at its peak. Also Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> approved funds for a 70-man team of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military observers to monitor the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from neighboring <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> becomes independent. That group, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Verification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION>, was budgeted at $ 9.2 million for this year and $ 19.4 million over the 31 months of the Cuban withdrawal. <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON>, the Argentine foreign minister and assembly president, said the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> probably would meet next week to approve funds for UNTAG. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> captured <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1915, during World War I, and was given a League of Nations mandate in 1920. The General Assembly abrogated the mandate in 1966 but <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> had refused to leave. The stage was set in December when <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> signed accords at <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters pledging them to a peace plan for southwest <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> combining Namibian independence with the Cuban withdrawal from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Cuban troops have helped <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government defend against U.S.-backed rebels and incursions by South African troops pursuing guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Under the peace accords, half the 50,000 Cuban soldiers will have withdrawn by Nov. 1, when <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> is scheduled to hold elections for a constituent assembly. Independence is envisaged in April 1990.

 Sporadic exchanges of artillery and machine-gun fire Thursday threatened to undermine a cease-fire that halted 22 hours of fighting between the army and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> militiamen for control of the Christian heartland. Police said 66 people were killed and 200 wounded in the fighting, which pitted the divided army's <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> units against the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, the main Christian militia in the nearly 14-year-old civil war against the Moslems. The army command and the Lebanese Forces said in separate announcements that an agreement was reached for both sides to pull back at all confrontation points `` to facilitate movement of people and civilian traffic.'' But neither side said whether the withdrawals actually took place. Fighters on both sides took advantage of the cease-fire starting Wednesday evening to fortify front-line positions northeast of the capital's Christian sector with sandbags and earthmounds, raising fears that a new round of hostilities was imminent. Police said regular troops and Lebanese Forces militiamen dueled intermittently with howitzers and machine guns in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ein </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rummaneh </LOCATION> district and the northern suburbs of <LOCATION> Tabarja </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Adma </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Antelias </LOCATION>. The thud of exploding shells echoed across the capital, which has been split into Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> sectors since the outbreak of the civil war in 1975. A military source said army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> accepted the cease-fire on condition that the Lebanese Forces pull out from east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> streets and from government facilities they control. The fighting has irrevocably shattered the unity of the Christian camp. It has involved mostly Maronite Catholics, the 850,000-strong group that has dominated power since <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943. Also Thursday, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> official denied <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> radio reports that Ambassador <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> has decided to evacuate the embassy's estimated 20 American staffers to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. `` There are no plans for us to leave,'' the official said on condition of anonymity. He said a couple of shells crashed about 200 yards from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy compound in the Aukur suburb of east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, but that none of the American employees was hurt. Window glass of the compound housing the diplomatic and consular missions was totally shattered, and both sections remained closed for the second straight day, he said. The police spokesman said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 20,000 troops have captured all militia positions in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s central mountain range but failed to block militia supply lines. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s troops now control about 75 percent of the Christian enclave covering 310 square miles north and northeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the spokesman said. But Lebanese Forces militiamen led by <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON> still control the main urban centers along the enclave's 25-mile <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> coastline, he added. The enclave is home for 1 million Christians. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s dual government, has been staying at his command headquarters in <LOCATION> Yarze </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, since the fighting broke out. The 53-year old general, who seeks to become <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s next president, was named head of a caretaker military cabinet by outgoing President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> Sept. 22 after parliament failed to elect his successor. In another development, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> woman was shot in the head and killed while driving her car in north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, one of her friends said. <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Pascoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Harfoush </PERSON>, 38, a native of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, was killed Wednesday afternoon as she drove her <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> to the village of <LOCATION> Burj </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Akkar </LOCATION>, 25 miles away, said her friend, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashka </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Rashka </PERSON>, an American who lives in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said she heard about Mrs. <PERSON> Harfoush </PERSON>'s death from friends whom she declined to identify. She said Mrs. <PERSON> Harfoush </PERSON> was shot twice in the head and neck, and that the motive for the killing was unknown.

 Some moose are spending lots of time on the town these days. With the Thief River frozen over, the animals use it as a highway to steal into this northwestern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> town where they wander down residential streets, dine on hedges and apple trees and often get their pictures taken. `` Everybody seems to enjoy them, other than they like to get them out of their yards,'' said police Officer <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. Usually, they go back home to the woods after police herd them to the edge of town by slowly driving alongside, maybe yelling, honking or sounding the siren. But these days, three persistent moose just are n't taking hints, so officers have taken to firing exploding shells to frighten them. `` We chase them out and they just come back,'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who has chased off the cow and her calves three times in a week. One reason the moose come to town, observers say, is that it's a lot easier to move around than in the woods, where the snow these days is moose-belly-deep.

 This Hollywood is none too happy with efforts by <LOCATION> Tinseltown </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> to take control of the city name.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Thursday he wants rebel forces in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to continue receiving humanitarian aid and declared `` we have to be wary'' about promises by leftist President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> to hold fair elections. In his first comments on an agreement by five Central American countries to disarm the Nicaraguan guerrillas, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> acknowledged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had been caught off guard by the pact, signed Tuesday, and said, `` There are some positive elements to it and there are some troublesome elements to it.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, on another foreign policy matter, said he hoped that <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, with the departure of Soviet troops, could fashion `` a stable, broadly based government'' without bloodshed among competing guerrilla groups. `` The time for bloodbaths is over and I would like to see the various factions get together and come up with recommendations that would lead to a peaceful <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> with no more bloodbaths,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He refused to endorse a Soviet proposal for an immediate cease-fire in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and an embargo on arms shipments to the country, expressing concern that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> may have stockpiled weapons there for the Marxist government. `` It would not be fair to have a tremendous amount of lethal supplies left behind and then cut off support for the resistance and thus leave an unacceptable imbalance,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He made his remarks in a wide-ranging question-and-answer session with eight reporters who were invited into the Oval Office. Sitting in a wing chair in front of a slow-burning fire, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also made these points: _ He would `` strongly oppose'' any attempt to outlaw all semi-automatic weapons if that would mean outlawing all pistols and rifles that could be fired continuously by repeatedly pulling the trigger The weapons are popular among drug gangs and one was used in the massacre of five children in a <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, schoolyard last month. A lifetime member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's biggest gun lobby, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I'm not about to suggest that a semi-automated hunting rifle be banned. _ He considers budget negotiations a `` two-way street'' with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and said he was not trying to shift to lawmakers the responsibility for proposing unpopular cuts <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was pleased so far with congressional reaction to his $ 1.16 trillion spending plan for fiscal 1990. _ He wants to avoid a dispute with <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> over interest rates `` because we are n't far apart. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has nudged up short-term interest rates in recent months as a precaution against inflation. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he did not think inflationary pressures in the economy warrant substantially higher interest rates. _ He is concerned about the slow pace of personnel appointments for his administration but said `` I do n't think it's hurting the government. He blamed delays on tougher rules governing the disclosure of assets. _ He said he hopes his campaign for high ethical standards in government has not `` created something that just carries things too far. He expressed sympathy for <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, his nominee as secretary of health and human services, who gave up accumulated sabbatical pay to join the government. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> had `` made the right decision'' to sell stocks in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> bank holding company that holds third-world loans. _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` we are far closer to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> than public perceptions might be'' after Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said a decision could be put off until 1991 on modernizing battlefield nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> are urging <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to support the modernization.

You always worry that you have your act totally together. ...''

He said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s regime has a history of `` promises made, promises broken. `` And so I think we have to be wary,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Let's be sure that we not leave the resistance standing alone, leave them twisting out there without fulfillment of the commitment to democracy on the part of the Sandinistas.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> humanitarian aid to the Nicaraguan rebels expires March 31. Asked if his comments suggested he would seek more money for the guerrillas, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` It could mean that.

Asked directly if he would ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for more aid, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had some time before making that decision but added, `` I have every intention of seeing that these people receive humanitarian support, but how that comes about, we'll just have to wait and see.''

 A moderate guerrilla faction on Thursday ended its boycott and rejoined a fragile coalition of rebel groups trying to form a new government in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Rebel soldiers, meanwhile, continued to attack cities held by government troops. Rockets fired into two cities killed at least 12 people, radio and <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> reports said. The attacks came one day after the last Soviet troops pulled out of the country, ending a nine-year intervention. Also Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> said 600 troops from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which supports the guerrillas, marched on an Afghan city on Feb. 10. At the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said Thursday he was considering <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s request for <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> border outposts to check the flow of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> arms to Afghan rebels. But he declined to say whether the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supply of arms to the rebels violates the April 14 agreement signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> that resulted in the Soviet troop withdrawal. Some Western officials have predicted that the Afghan army will be unable to prevent <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and other major Afghan cities from being taken by Moslem guerrilla forces now that the Soviet forces are gone. Leaders of Afghan guerrilla factions based in neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> are meeting here to try and reach a consensus on forming a new government that will encompass their disparate views. The Pakistan-based <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> rebel group returned to the council Thursday after a two-day boycott because `` we can not do much by remaining outside,'' said group spokesman <PERSON> Zabihullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mojaddidi </PERSON>. On Wednesday, guerrilla leaders put a plan for a provisional government before the 400-member council. <PERSON> Mojaddidi </PERSON> said the proposal is incomplete and `` we do n't believe it should be discussed at this stage.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> boycotted the shura after its proposal for allowing Afghans living in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to take part in the new government was rejected by the other leaders of the seven-member guerrilla alliance based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The role of the Iran-based rebels has been turned over to a special commission. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalili </PERSON>, spokesman for eight Iran-based guerrilla parties, said Thursday his group will not accept the decisions of the commission because it is n't a part of it. Most of the rebels based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> are Sunni Moslems and most of the Afghans based in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> are Shiite Moslems. The majority of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s 15 million people are Sunni Moslems. In <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, six civilians, including three children, were killed when rockets blasted residential areas of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, an Afghan <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Badakhshi </PERSON>, who lost his 11-year-old daughter in the attack, asked, `` Who is doing this?'' `` I've lost my daughter, and now I'm losing my mind,'' he told reporters. <LOCATION> Ghazni </LOCATION> city, about 105 miles south of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, also was hit by rockets that killed six, reported Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The state-controlled radio blamed criminial extremists, presumably referring to anti-communsit rebels. Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> also charged Pakistani troops were sent into <LOCATION> Ghazni </LOCATION> to `` carry out terrorist activities.'' <LOCATION> Ghazni </LOCATION> is about 90 miles west of the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border. Some of the 600 Pakistani soldiers were deployed to the garrison town of <LOCATION> Urgun </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Paktika </LOCATION> province, the radio broadcast claimed. The <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> government has denied crossing into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to support the rebels. Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> said 34 guerrillas were killed in fighting Wednesday and Thursday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Thursday, Afghan Foreign Minister <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> said his government asked the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to set up outposts along the Afghan-Pakistan border to halt the flow of arms to guerrillas. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> was noncommittal. `` I am considering this,'' he said The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has about 50 observers in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to monitor compliance with the U.N.-mediated agreement. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief also was asked whether <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the rebels was a violation of the pact. `` This is a subject which I intend to discuss with American authorities when I meet them,'' he said, referring to his trip to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Friday.

<HEAD>Makers of Containers Widely Used by Fast-Food Industry Stop Using
CFCs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Makers of foam plastic containers widely used by fast-food restaurants have stopped using CFCs which contribute to destruction of the world's ozone layer, a trade group said Thursday. It said makers of the food and beverage containers no longer use fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, as an expanding agent during the manufacturing process. When CFCs reach the stratosphere, they break down the ozone layer that protects the Earth from ultraviolet rays. Increased exposure to this solar radiation is known to cause skin cancer. An international agreement has called for cutting the production of CFCs by 50 percent by the end of the century and some of the leading manufacturers have said they intend to phase out production of CFCs entirely, although no timetable has been set. CFCs are most widely used in refrigeration and air-conditionining systems. Their use as an expanding agent in manufacturing food and beverage containers always has been small, accounting for less than 3 percent of all CFCs produced. But <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dull </PERSON>, whose office at the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> monitors <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> use, said elimination of CFCs from food service containers is significant because it represents the first time an entire industry has stopped using the chemicl. `` What we're applauding ... is a process, the beginning of a process,'' <PERSON> Dull </PERSON> said at a news conference held by the <ORGANIZATION> Polystyrene </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Packaging </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Foodservice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Packaging </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. He said the phaseout of CFCs in the making of polystyrene food containers `` is proof that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> industry can develop inexpensive, technological alternatives to CFCs.'' Recently, the <ORGANIZATION> Polyurethane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> also announced plans to phase out the use of CFCs in making foam cushioning, he said. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bow </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Foodservice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Packaging </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said the makers of the fast-food containers have replaced CFCs in the production of polystyrene with another chemical that poses a significantly lesser threat to the ozone layer because it breaks up at a much lower altitude. `` We realize this -LRB- replacement -RRB- product too has some ozone depleting potential,'' he said, adding that the industry is searching for another agent that poses no such threat at all.

 <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has signed a contract to purchase as many as 30 commerical aircraft from <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION> in a deal estimated to be worth as much as $ 3 billion, <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> officials announced Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to purchase 15 Airbus A340 aircraft, which are to be delivered between September 1992 and March 1994. <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> will receive both A4340-200s, which seat 222 passengers, and the larger A340-300s, which have 256-seat cabins. According to the contract, signed Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> will decide later on whether to purchase the additional 15 aircraft. <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> officials said <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> will use the A340s to replace its fleet of DC10-30 aircraft. The new jets will enable <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> to offer more non-stop, long-range routes from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> officials. With th <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> order, <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> now has firm orders, options and commitments for 110 A340 aircraft. <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION>'s order gives another boost to the commercial jet industry, which is already enjoying a successful year. Earlier this month, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> signed a 142-plane deal with <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The contract was estimated to be worth as much as $ 7 billion. Last year, $ 48.5 billion dollars worth of new planes were ordered, the highest total ever. The <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> purchase plan continues a trend predicted by industry officials, who estimate that the demand to replace aging aircraft could push annual aircraft sales to $ 450 billion in 1989 dollars by the year 2005.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> lifted its stay delaying the start of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial Thursday, but <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers complained he can not get a fair trial under a deal struck by his prosecutor and the attorney general for handling testimony involving national secrets. `` Defendant <PERSON> North </PERSON> still faces two governments, rather than a single prosecutor with full power to make all trial decisions,'' said <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, the head of <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s defense team, in papers filed with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, lifted a stay that had been requested by Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> while he was still arguing with independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> over whether rules on disclosing classified information were tight enough. There was no word from <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> when he would summon jurors, who are already selected, to his court to begin the trial of the former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel and White House aide. However, a meeting was scheduled in <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s courtroom Friday, meaning the jury would not be empaneled until Tuesday at the earliest _ after the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s Birthday holiday observance. The newest Thornburgh-Walsh arrangement `` would impose intolerable burdens on the court, the witnesses, and the jurors,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. He asked <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> to tell the attorney general he can take action to dismiss the entire case or any of the 12 criminal charges but that he will not `` have the right or the opportunity to intervene in the trial.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> recalled that <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> had said earlier in the week that <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> would have no right to intervene `` by bits and pieces'' to object to the introduction of classified material. But <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said the new arrangement does give <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> that ability. Under the arrangement announced Wednesday, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> agreed to ask <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> for an affidavit whenever <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> believed undisclosable secrets were about to be spilled in the trial. The attorney general would stay out of the courtroom while the independent counsel carried the battle. `` Under the independent counsel's proposed plan,'' said <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, the attorney general will have the right to step in `` whenever the going gets tough, precisely what the court has forbidden him from doing.'' In response, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyer is under a misconception of how the prosecutorial plan will work. `` The day-to-day conduct of this case will be by the independent counsel and only the independent counsel,'' he said. He likened his relationship with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to that of a lawyer who checks with his client `` to find out whether some supervening policy requires a termination of the litigation.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said the new arrangement would guarantee frequent interruptions, as challenges are made and resolved. `` This procedure will recur constantly during the trial _ possibly even question-by-question for a critical witness,'' he said. `` Defendant North can not receive a fair trial if the attorney general is permitted to intervene in the trial through bits and pieces of affidavit as the independent counsel's plan contemplates.'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> and lawyers in the case held a closed hearing, lasting more than two hours, to discuss what the jury can be told about secret <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration efforts to get help from other countries for the Contras fighting the leftist Nicaraguan government. Lawyers would not say what happened at the hearing, only that the same subject matter will be discussed at another closed session Friday morning. They said <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> had not issued any orders and shook their heads when asked when opening arguments might be held. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> says the `` quid pro quo'' arrangements _ literally, something-for-something _ are at the heart of the case. The government is willing to make limited disclosures about the matter, but <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers want to explore the schemes in greater detail at his trial. In nearly three weeks, the North trial has not progressed beyond picking a jury of nine women and three men. The jurors, who have not yet been sworn, have been excused while a high-stakes legal drama over national security matters has been played out in <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s courtroom, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> North is accused of shredding evidence and lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to cover up the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's attempts to help the rebels during a period in which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had banned direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. He faces 12 criminal charges.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is planning to set up a tent-city detention center where it will hold Central American refugees while their applications for political asylum are processed, congressional officials said Thursday. Rep. <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, said in a statement the tent city on isolated brushland 15 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border would meet basic human necessities _ adequate housing, food and sanitary conditions. But <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said no course of action has been `` set in stone'' and the issue is still under review by <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> and Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, who has already said detention is an option. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the idea of a tent city is one option under consideration. But one source indicated it may not be the preferred option saying: `` nobody wants tent cities.'' More than 2,000 refugees a week are entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and most of them do so by crossing the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, officials say. The plans call for keeping the refugees in tents near the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Isabel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Processing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> where INS is processing their asylum applications, the congressional officials said. But <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and two congressional aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the tents would have plywood floors and food would be provided by contractors. No fences would surround the tents, they said. One congressional aide said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> policy will begin after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Filemon </PERSON> <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> is expected to reinstate an <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> policy that bars asylum-seekers from traveling beyond the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> while their applications are pending. <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> is supposed to rule in the case Tuesday and <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> would discuss its plans for handling the refugees at the court hearing, but not before. Before <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> blocked the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>' no-travel policy Jan. 9, Central Americans who had crossed the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> illegally were forced to live in shanty town conditions _ camped out beneath plastic sheets in open fields _ or condemned buildings. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials contend many people seeking asylum are here only to better themselves economically and use the asylum process and lengthy appeals to get into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Political asylum is granted only to those fleeing persecution for political or other reasons.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told West European leaders Thursday the time is not right to push for negotiations between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION>, a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> promised, however, to have American diplomats pursue prospects with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states and report the results in three weeks, the official said. `` One has to till the ground carefully; one has to proceed cautiously and understand that if you push the level of discussion too high, too soon, and create too much international attention you might preempt opportunities,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was quoted as telling the <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> foreign minster, <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> den </PERSON> <PERSON> Broek </PERSON>, at The Hague. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity, said van den <ORGANIZATION> Broek </ORGANIZATION> gave <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> a brief account of findings by the French, Greek and Spanish foreign ministers, whom the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> appointed to explore <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace prospects. They visited <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> earlier this month and also met with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representatives. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said they found areas of potential progress and also obstacles, but he provided no details. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s cautious response indicated the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration was not eager to plunge into the Middle Eastern thicket despite its contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. His assurance that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> would be sounded out also seemed to rule out a suspension of the 3-month-old dialogue despite <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> irritation over a clash between Palestinian guerrillas and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> forces in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Five guerrillas were slain in what <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said was an attempted infiltration of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and an act of terrorism. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> opened talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in December only after its leader, <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, made a public statement renouncing terrorism. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> would report results of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soundings on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> at the opening of arms control negotiations between <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> on March 7. All the Western foreign ministers are expected to attend. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also met with <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, as he neared the end of an eight-day trip to 15 allied countries. He is exploring their views on foreign policy and defense before President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> decides how to deal with Soviet arms reduction proposals that have raised hopes of disarmament by West Europeans and unsettled their leaders. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was finding an `` ironic'' situation: that President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposals were largely inspired by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> public was giving the Soviet leader much of the credit. Although <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> gave four news conferences on the first four days of the trip, he has kept reporters at a distance since and sid little. The secretary of state began the day in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, meeting with Prime Minister <PERSON> Wilfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tindemans </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and then with <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters.

 Four candidates to succeed <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> as the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s civil rights chief would change his controversial policies, according to one of those being considered for the job. `` Everyone on the list would turn it around,'' said one of the candidates, who knows the others and spoke on condition he not be identified. Without discussing specific issues, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he wants to depart from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's civil rights policies, which included frontal attacks on existing affirmative action hiring quotas and school busing programs. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> also signaled a shift in policies by meeting with civil rights leaders, including <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. A top candidate for the job is <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a disabled-rights advocate who once called for <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>' resignation during a battle over proposed changes in regulations prohibiting discrimination against the handicapped, according to administration sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who uses a wheelchair, is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. He is considered the White House's choice to become assistant attorney general in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s civil rights division, the sources said. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said in an interview this week that <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> told him he was a top candidate for the job and his meeting Tuesday with <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> did not dispel that impression. Also under consideration are <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinzel </PERSON>, minority chief counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s permanent investigations subcommittee; <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON>, former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, a career <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, said the sources. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, emerging from his meeting last month with <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, praised the attorney general's commitment to civil rights and told reporters that `` the lights have been turned back on in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, an aide to the attorney general, said `` we're looking for someone whose views reflect <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s and the president's views on the importance of the civil rights division. `` We're looking for somebody who can work with civil rights organizations,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said, noting <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s interest in the issue dating back to the 1960s. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> clashed repeatedly with civil rights groups, who accused him of trying to undercut the force of federal laws and court decisions affecting minority rights. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> helped formulate and direct the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's challenges to minority hiring quotas He also spearheaded the efforts to overturn court-ordered busing and restrict guarantees of the rights of women and the mentally ill. Without directly criticizing <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to attract black voters last fall was due in part to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's civil rights record. `` I think it's very important for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to have a civil rights record they can run on and attract votes from groups covered by the civil rights laws.'' While no decision is expected for at least another week, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> `` is certainly a leading candidate,'' said one administation source. The appointment will be made by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s recommendation and is subject to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation <PERSON> Rinzel </PERSON> is a former career <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyer who headed the criminal section of the civil rights division, setting records for prosecutions. He was promoted to a deputy assistant attorney general by <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, the acting civil rights chief, was a government civil rights lawyer in the 1960s when violence flared in such places as <LOCATION> Selma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, Miss. He prosecuted civil rights violators in the South during this period. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> has served as counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> Wednesday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> moderate Republicans. Without commenting on specific individuals, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> civil rights lawyer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said `` at least some of the candidates who are being considered seem to have some experience and some have a record of favoring civil rights.'' `` If one of those candidates is named, it will be a refreshing change'' from the previous eight years, said <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, who heads the enforcement committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>First Opposition Party Formed in Yugoslavia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LJUBLJANA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The first full-fledged opposition party in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> since the Communist takeover after World War II was established on Thursday, despite a police threat to ban the party if it stayed independent. About 1,000 people jammed into the downtown Cankarjev Dom convention hall in this Slovenian capital to hear party leader <PERSON> France </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomsic </PERSON> proclaim the founding of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>. He told the founding convention the party would strive for parliamentary democracy and free elections and intends to compete for parliamentary representation with the League of Communists, the only legal party here since 1946. Prominent intellectuals from <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> were among those attending. The party published its program in Wednesday's issue of the liberal <PERSON> Mladina </PERSON> youth weekly, saying it `` will strive for a peaceful transition from the country's single-party -LRB- Communist -RRB- system to a system based on -LRB- Western-style -RRB- parliamentary democracy.'' His audience on Thursday loudly applauded <PERSON> Tomsic </PERSON>'s appeal for <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> to seek closer ties with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and its social democratic parties. `` This convention is important because after nearly 50 years an alternative independent political party is being formed in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Tomsic </PERSON> said. He said earlier in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, `` As a political organization we will try to fill the vacuum created by the loss of trust in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' At the entrance, party aides distributed party literature and application forms. The party program called for parliamentary democracy, an independent judiciary, private initiative, independent unions and legalization of strikes. It said the Slovenian republic and all of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> should `` link up with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> political, technological and cultural integration'' process. It demanded abolition of military courts. <PERSON> Tomsic </PERSON> said Slovenian recruits should be allowed to do their military service in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> and that Slovene should become an official language in the army, where only <LOCATION> Serbo-Croatian </LOCATION> is now spoken. <PERSON> Tomsic </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> earlier, `` <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s history has shown that social democracy had done much more for the people than the Communists.'' He said the party would be independent. A short time later, <PERSON> Tomsic </PERSON> was summoned to police where he was told that both the party and the convention would be banned unless his group joined the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, a Communist-led mass organization comprising all social and political groups. The convention went on as planned, however. Asked if his group would join the umbrella organization, <PERSON> Tomsic </PERSON> said, `` The statute of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Slovenia </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to be changed in April and according to the proposed changes the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will not retain the leading role in it. `` If that happens, we will join the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>.'' A recent survey conducted by <PERSON> Mladina </PERSON> said that if free elections were conducted immediately in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, the Social Democrats would get 35 percent of the vote and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> only 9 percent. The rest of the votes went to groups now exiting only in the imagination, such as <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> and Liberals. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, with a population exceeding 22 million, is a patchwork of six republics and two autonomous provinces. <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> led <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> into the Communist camp in November 1945, but this country broke from the Soviet orbit in 1948 and has since been non-aligned. Last Jan. 11, the first autonomous political group in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, the Slovenian <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, was formed in <LOCATION> Ljubljana </LOCATION>, but it agreed to operate within the framework of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>. Prominent intellectuals have called for the introduction of a multiparty democracy here, saying it would be the only way out of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s deep economic and political crisis.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Thursday he will `` strongly oppose'' any attempt to outlaw semiautomatic guns, despite increasing homicides and the use of such a weapon in a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> rampage that left five children dead. His declaration put him at odds with his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, who told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Feb. 3 she is afraid of guns and `` absolutely'' believes that assault-style weapons should be outlawed. Spurning pleas for tougher controls, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` No, I'm not about to do that. And I think the answer is the criminal _ do more with the criminal.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a lifetime member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's chief gun lobby, said states `` have a lot of laws on these things. Let them enforce them. It's hard, very hard to do, but that's my position and I'm not going to change it.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made his comments in an Oval Office interview with eight reporters. He drew a distinction between automatic weapons, which fire continuously by holding the trigger down, and semiautomatic weapons, which fire each time the trigger is pulled without cocking. Talking about semiautomatics, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` If you're suggesting that every pistol that can do that -LRB- fire each time the trigger is pulled -RRB- or every rifle should be banned, I would strongly oppose that. `` I would strongly go after the criminals who use these guns,'' he said. `` But I'm not about to suggest that a semi-automated hunting rifle be banned. Absolutely not.'' The president said he learned just earlier in the day that fully automatic weapons are banned from import into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was concerned `` enormously'' by the rash of homicides in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Thirteen people were killed or wounded by gunfire in the city on Tuesday, making Valentine's Day the bloodiest day in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in memory. `` When you let a guy out of jail to commit a crime like this _ it's outrageous. Two of these people were people that already had, have ... Help,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, turning to his staff for information. It was not clear which cases <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was talking about, although a gunman who killed three coworkers in suburban <LOCATION> Chevy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, before killing himself had been a patient in a mental hospital for two years before being released in 1986. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration did not have any plans now for tighter gun controls. Dozens of states, as well as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, are considering measures to outlaw the manufacture, sale or possession of a variety of semiautomatic weapons. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police chief <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, an adviser to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during the presidential campaign on drug abuse and crime, has endorsed legislation to limit the sale and import of assault weapons. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> has banned the sale of semiautomatic weapons but has delayed its order for a week in connection with a suit filed by <ORGANIZATION> Colt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> challenging the law. Before the interview, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s position on guns was outlined during a White House briefing, even as the district's homicide toll reached 75, following a record 372 homicides in 1988. `` Everyone in the country, including the president, is outraged by the homicides whether it be in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> or anywhere else,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` There are any number of appropriate solutions to this kind of problems, the most obvious is for stepped up law enforcement but I know that everyone shares those concerns,'' the press spokesman said. `` It does pose a major challenge to the law enforcement community in this country and there are a lot of ways you can come at that but we do n't have any comment on specific episodes,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> added. It was a Chinese AK-47 assault rifle that a gunman used in a rampage last month in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, in which five children were killed and 29 others were wounded. `` The issue of assault weapons and AK-47s and so forth is an important one that has emerged in these recent episodes and one that probably needs to be looked at, in fact is being looked at by any number of state authorities as well as public interest groups who are involved in this,'' the White House spokesman said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` has concerns about these items. We're simply saying that we do n't have any proposals for changing gun control laws at this point But on the other hand it is worthwhile for a consideration of these new weapons and what do they mean for society and should there be any changes.''

<HEAD>Playwright Thomas Bernhard Dead At 58</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON>, the controversial writer and dramatist known as the enfant terrible of Austrian theater and literature, has died at age 58, police said Thursday. The cause of death was officially given as heart failure, a police spokesman said on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> was most recently in the headlines over the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> production last fall of his play, `` Heldenplatz,'' which caused a furor with its outspoken criticism of anti-Semitism, President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> and other politicians and institutions in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. The playwright was found dead in his house in the town of <LOCATION> Gmunden </LOCATION>, 80 miles west of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> Sunday morning, three days after his 58th birthday, the police spokesman told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He declined to say why it had taken four days to announce the death, but the <ORGANIZATION> Austria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> later reported it was <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON>'s wish to be buried before his death was announced <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON>'s half-brother, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fabjan </PERSON>, disclosed the playwright's last wish after a brief funeral today, the news agency said <PERSON> Barnhard </PERSON> had suffered for the past 40 years from a lung condition that Austrian radio said required regular treatment with cortisone. Born on Feb. 9, 1931 in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> was the illegitimate child of a <LOCATION> Salzburg </LOCATION> woman and a peasant father whom he never knew. He grew up in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, the Austrian countryside and southern <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> before being sent in his early teens to a home in <LOCATION> Salzburg </LOCATION>. Leaving school early to become a grocer's apprentice, <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> was hospitalized for months at a time with severe lung complaints from 1948 to 1951. In 1955, he entered <LOCATION> Salzburg </LOCATION>'s famed Mozarteum to study acting and music, and in 1957 published his first volume of poetry. Publication of several novels, short stories and more poetry followed, winning an increasing series of awards for the man whom prominent West German critic <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Reich-Ranicki </PERSON> termed `` the most melancholy poet and most bitter prophet of German literature.'' His plays, often directed by the current controversial director of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>'s Burgtheater, <PERSON> Claus </PERSON> <PERSON> Peymann </PERSON>, were a continual subject of controversy in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Salzburg </LOCATION>. In 1976, for instance, his play `` The Famous'' opened in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> after being rejected by the <LOCATION> Salzburg </LOCATION> festival because of its criticism of prominent <LOCATION> Salzburg </LOCATION> cultural figures. Peymann's production of `` Heldenplatz'' at the Burgtheater last fall also sparked a raging controversy over whether state money should be used to subsidize art so critical of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. Many <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> critics, however, praised the play and its performance.

<TEXT>
 A conservative Episcopal group on Thursday renewed efforts to muster resistance to female priests with a full-page newspaper ad less than a week after the 450-year-old church ordained its first woman bishop. `` Episcopalians! Do Something,'' trumpeted the advertisement in the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, a daily newspaper in the diocese that consecrated Bishop <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. Sponsors said the ads will run elsewhere in the country this spring. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> was `` as logical a place as any to begin,'' said <PERSON> Canon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brien </PERSON> <PERSON> Koehler </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, Texas-based Evangelical and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION>, which is behind the ad campaign. <PERSON> Koehler </PERSON> said it is unlikely the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> will reverse its 10-year policy of allowing women into the priesthood. He said a Synod, or council, the mission is organizing to be held this June is intended to `` find a way to allow ourselves to live and breathe within the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. Whether the official channels of the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> will tolerate that, I think that's really a great question right now.'' The ad asks readers to sign and return to the group a `` declaration of common faith and purpose.'' <PERSON> Koehler </PERSON> said mission members believe that biblical teachings portray the church as a family with the man, or husband, as the head. `` Those are strong Bible images that we really think ca n't be overturned,'' he said. `` It really has nothing to do with equal rights.'' It was the latest note of discord since <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> was elected last September, a position that gave her entry into an apostolic succession the church traces back to the time of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>. At <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' consecration as suffragan, or assistant, bishop, two men spoke against the ordination, including one who termed it sacrilege. But the congregation of about 8,000 roared its approval when asked if it was their will that she be ordained. The 58-year-old black Episcopal priest from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> had been criticized for being a woman, being divorced, lacking formal seminary degrees and having served as publisher of the liberal <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> publication `` The Witness.'' <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushing </PERSON>, an Episcopalian and state representative who is a friend of <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>', said the advertisement was n't a surprise. `` This organization has been beating up on the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and beat up on <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> when she was executive director of that company,'' he said. Officials of the 96,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diocese </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> said they had no comment on the ad. Spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Solheim </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> was aware of the ad and had no comment. At a news conference after her election was formally approved by Episcopal bishops around the country, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> acknowledged that some church members would have difficulty with her role, but said she did not believe a schism would result. <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>, director of development at the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Divinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, said she also doubted schism will ensue. She said the ad was a way for the opponents of ordaining women `` to fly their flag.'' `` I think that we're going to find a way to work together and keep the dialogue going,'' she said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Thursday he hopes the final pullout of Soviet armed forces from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> ensures `` no more bloodbaths'' there and said the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> bears a special responsibility for `` healing the wounds'' of the war. While applauding the troop withdrawal as `` a new chapter in the history of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rejected a Kremlin call for an immediate cease-fire and arms embargo. Answering questions from a group of reporters in the Oval Office, he said he was afraid rebels opposing the Soviet-backed <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government would be left in a disadvantageous position if <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance stopped. Just hours before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> talked to reporters, the second-ranking official at the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had reiterated the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s call for a cease-fire. Minister-Counselor <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Kutovoy </PERSON> said that a comprehensive settlement of the strife in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> depends for the most part on `` a broadly based government with the participation of all warring parties and without outside interference.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> demanded the Soviets stay out of Afghan affairs. `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has nothing to fear from the establishment of an independent, non-aligned <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' he said in a written statement. `` At the same time, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> bears a special responsibility for healing the wounds of this war, and we call upon it to support generously international efforts to rebuild <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comments came a day after the final pullout of <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> forces from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> after a nine-year occupation. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he could not endorse the cease-fire and arms embargo proposal because he was concerned Soviet forces may have stockpiled weapons for the Marxist government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. `` It would not be fair to have a tremendous amount of lethal supplies left behind and then cut off support for the resistance and thus leave an uacceptable imbalance,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said there has been massive stockpiling by the Soviets in recent months. Supplies provided to the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime include numerous fighter aircraft and helicopters, dozens of medium tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, armored personnel carriers, more than 200 howitzers and scores of other artillery pieces and hundreds of transport vehicles. `` In the final days of the withdrawal, they left behind even more military equipment, including tanks, <ORGANIZATION> APCs </ORGANIZATION> and multiple rocket launchers,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitment to the <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> people `` will remain firm, both through our bilateral humanitarian program and through the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>' efforts to remove the mines and resettle the refugees and help reconstruct the war-torn economy.'' There are widespread fears that a struggle for control by competing guerrilla groups could throw <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> into a civil war. `` The time for recrimination is over,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` The time for bloodbaths is over and I would like to see the various factions get together and come up with recommendations that would lead to a peaceful <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> with no more bloodbaths.'' During the Soviet Embassy news conference, <PERSON> Kutovoy </PERSON> said, `` The question at stake at the present time is this: either restoration of peace on the Afghan soil or continuation of senseless bloodshed.'' `` The issues of humanitarian and economic assistance to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> are of ever-growing significance at this crucial stage,'' he said. But the Soviet official also said, `` When certain elements of the Afghan opposition are trying to intensify pressure on the current Afghan government, resorting to barbaric methods and to all different kinds of diversions, to the blockade of Afghan cities, they are trying to prevent the civilian population from getting food and consumer goods.'' `` It is our first belief that all the states should do their best to preserve <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> as a sovereign, neutral and non-aligned state,'' he said.

 Democratic aides on a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee said in a report Thursday that the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s civil rights office is beset by mismanagement, confusion and understaffing as a legacy of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. The investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> enforcement activities _ by <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> staff at the Education and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> _ concluded that since 1981, the office `` has been stymied by an administration which actively opposed the laws which were entrusted to it and took efforts to minimize the agency's potential impact.'' The report said the administration had `` severely worsened this agency's enforcement record'' and said any enforcement that did occur came from the regional staff `` in spite of <ORGANIZATION> OCR </ORGANIZATION>'s leadership'' in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> is in charge of enforcing statutes barring discrimination on the basis of race, gender, handicap, age and national origin in all federally funded education activities and programs. The current director of the agency, <PERSON> LeGree </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, is a holdover from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. In a letter published with the report, she denounced it as `` replete with inaccuracies and misconceptions of <ORGANIZATION> OCR </ORGANIZATION>'s role.'' She accused the committee staff of misrepresenting her agency's investigative and enforcement procedures, distorting statistical evidence and drawing unsubstantiated conclusions She defended the agency's emphasis on negotiations, calling them `` an effective, legally supportable practice'' that has averted the need for protracted enforcement proceedings in many cases. Democratic committee aides visited six of the 10 <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> regional offices between January and March 1988. Among their findings, according to the report: _ The agency initiated 9,768 complaint investigations between fiscal 1981 and 1988, most of them related to handicap discrimination Fifteen percent involved racial discrimination, a percentage the report said was `` a violation of its mandate'' since the office was created as a result of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. _ The number of fulltime equivalent employees at the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> has dropped from 1,099 in fiscal 1981 to 820 in fiscal 1988 <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration budget requests for the agency declined from $ 51 million in 1982 to $ 41 million in 1989. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> decision prompted the agency to close in whole or in part 674 complaint investigations and 88 compliance reviews The decision said only specific activities or programs receiving federal money were subject to federal oversight. _ The administration forced the agency to process state higher-education desegregation cases under court oversight in 105 days rather than the 195 days recommended by the federal court Cases were withdrawn or narrowed to accomplish this. _ There was `` a clear perception among the regional office staff that certain issues were ` off limits' and could not be investigated Most of the issues involved race discrimination.'' _ Letters of findings citing schools for civil rights violations must be approved by the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office Of 112 draft letters submitted from January 1987 to June 1988, only seven were approved while most were resolved with a notation `` violation corrected.'' Little follow-up monitoring was done to assure actual compliance by school districts and universities. The committee staff recommended, among other things, that the agency conduct more broad compliance reviews of systemic discrimination issues, particularly on race. The report said the agency's staff should be restored as quickly as possible to the 1981 level and said the agency should submit staff, computer and equipment needs to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in time for fiscal 1990 budget consideration.

<HEAD>Pinochet Won't Run In December Election</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Military President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said Thursday he will not run in scheduled December presidential elections, but he urged government supporters to unite to pick `` one of ours'' as his successor. The constitution bars <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> from succeeding himself, but several pro-government politicians have suggested that a formula be found to allow him to run, such as a constitutional amendment. `` I'm not here as a candidate,'' Gen. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, 72, said at a luncheon with supporters in <LOCATION> Loncoche </LOCATION>, a rural community 370 miles south of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>. `` I can not be a candidate now.'' The president's remarks, carried by local radio stations, was his strongest rejection so far of the possibility he might run in the election, scheduled for Dec. 14. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, who seized power in a violent 1973 coup, was obliged to call elections after losing an Oct. 5 referendum in which he sought voters' approval to remain in power until 1997. On the third day of an eight-day tour of southern <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> urged his supporters to restore their unity, which had been badly disrupted in the wake of the referendum defeat. At least two pro-government politicians have announced their candidacies to succeed <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>. A group of independent businessmen and politicians are actively promoting the nomination of <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s finance minister, <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>, 39, so far has refused to accept the candidacy. `` You must work together for a government of ours,'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> told his audience. `` It does not make a difference the person who is nominated, as long he is one of ours. The candidate must be the one we all pick. That's our man.'' The opposition also has stated plans to seek a single candidate. Leaders of a coalition of 17 opposition parties are scheduled to meet next month to pick from among at least four contenders to the nomination. <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, a moderate former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> president, is considered the frontrunner. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> is president of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the largest in the opposition, and was the chief spokesman for the opposition during the campaign for the referendum. According to the constitution, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> must hand power to the winner of the December election on March 11, 1990.

 Biologists trying to protect migrating fish said Thursday the death of one of two captured sea lions would n't deter efforts to snare more of the fish-eating mammals and return them to the ocean. The 550-pound animal had a week-old bullet wound in its neck and died after coming out from under anesthesia administered so wildlife agents could examine him and attach a radio transmitter. The wound and an infestation of lung worms `` may have compromised his ability ... to withstand the anesthesia,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLong </PERSON>, a marine mammal biologist with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` Using anesthesia on the animal was one of the risks that went along with studying them,'' he said. <PERSON> DeLong </PERSON> said the wounded sea lion may have been shot by someone frustrated by the animals continued presence at the <ORGANIZATION> Ballard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Locks </ORGANIZATION> which the migrating fish use from January until spring. `` I'm afraid we're going to see more and more shootings,'' <PERSON> DeLong </PERSON> said. About 20 sea lions, which migrate from southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, have stopped at the locks to feast on salmon and steelhead trout migrating from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> through Puget Sound to the fresh water lakes and rivers of western <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The other sea lion captured Wednesday was taken 250 miles to the southwest <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> coast where it was to be released Thursday, as agents tried to capture more sea lions. The wounded sea lion had probably been shot near the locks, which are in an urban area surrounded by docks and homes, <PERSON> DeLong </PERSON> said. <PERSON> DeLong </PERSON> said a .22 - caliber bullet wound was found lodged in the throat of the sea lion, who was sick before he was trapped in the floating cage agents are using in the removal program, called `` Operation Goodbye This is the fifth year officials have tried to keep a growing number of sea lions away from the locks. Protective nets, tape recordings of killer whales, firecrackers and foul-tasting chemicals have all proved ineffective. <PERSON> DeLong </PERSON> said sea lions are protected from shooting by federal law, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year rejected an option to allow managers of the animals to use lethal methods to control them. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Deeble </PERSON> of the environmental group <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>, which has monitored the removal efforts and given tentative approval, questioned whether it was necessary to anesthetize the animals. He said he would support simply transporting the animals and marking them with paint rather than attaching radio transmitters in order to determine whether the removed sea lions return to the locks. Wildlife officials plan to capture at least a half dozen animals and haul them to the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, then monitor their movement. Last year, sea lions ate an estimated 1,800 of the wild steelhead, a sea-going rainbow trout favored by anglers, and only about 850 of them made it back to their spawning gravel, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION>. This year's run of steelhead was about 1,650 at the fish ladder, down from about 2,600 last year, officials said last month.

 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> on Thursday called off until after President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s trip to <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> a planned floor vote on legislation that would require disclosure of foreign property ownership in this country. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s office said the White House indicated it hoped there would be no vote on the bill sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, until after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> returns from next week's trip to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had been set to vote next Thursday on the bill, which would require foreign owners of American property to provide information about their holdings to the government. The measure began as part of the 1,000-page trade bill that became law last year but was dropped before that legislation received the president's signature. The administration and various business critics said it would stifle vitally needed foreign investment and hurt business in other ways. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> and other proponents say Americans deserve to have more information about foreign ownership of property in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s office said the speaker telephoned <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday afternoon from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and offered to postpone the vote. `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressed his appreciation,'' the statement said.

<HEAD>Pipe Break Forces Shutdown At Plutonium Extraction Building</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The operator of the government's problem-plagued nuclear weapons complex in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> said Thursday it had discovered a break in an underground pipe that carries slightly radioactive waste water to a treatment plant E.I. du <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemours </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said it temporarily reduced operations at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> chemical separation facility while it replaced a 10-foot section of the pipe and inspected other underground pipes of similar construction. The company said the waste water that leaked from the broken pipe was high in acid content with `` minute amounts'' of radioactivity and posed no danger to workers or the environment. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Odum </PERSON>, chief supervisor with du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>'s environment and energy department at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview that workers first detected a problem early this week when a liquid accumulation was noticed on the surface. The leaking pipe is eight inches in diameter and is nine feet underground. On Wednesday it was determined that a small section of the pipe had broken off, <PERSON> Odum </PERSON> said, adding that it was too early to estimate how long it would take to fix the problem. The incident is the latest in a series of technical problems that have arisen at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, the site of three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> nuclear reactors that produce tritium, a radioactive gas needed to make most nuclear weapons. All three reactors are shut down because of safety and technical problems. <PERSON> Odum </PERSON> said the pipe leak had no direct affect on the tritium-producing reactors. The chemical separation plant at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> separates plutonium from used fuel rods from the reactors. The plutonium is then shipped to the Rocky Flats Plant at <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, where it is shaped into triggers to be used on nuclear warheads. Once the plutonium is separated from the high-level radioactive waste in the used fuel ods, the liquid waste is taken to a tank farm at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, where some of the waste is evaporated. The remaining water, containing what du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> called minute amounts of radioactivity, is then piped to an effluent treatment plant for further purification before it is discharged into streams. The pipe that developed the leak was installed at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> during the 1950s and is made of terra cotta, a thick, hard pottery-like material widely used in sewer lines at that time.

<TEXT>
 A Lithuanian political organization that claims more than 150,000 members agreed to seek an `` independent path'' but stopped shy of calling for secession from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, one of its leaders said Thursday. The action coincided with the anniversary of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s original declaration of independence in 1918. Hundreds of thousands of Lithuanians turned out for two days of public celebrations, which were greeted with police dogs and beatings just one year ago. The vote late Wednesday night by the national assembly of the grass-roots group, <ORGANIZATION> Sajudis </ORGANIZATION>, amounted to the strongest call yet out of the small Baltic republic for control over its own affairs. <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> has been a part of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> since it was annexed during World War II. Small organizations in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> have demanded secession, and speakers at public rallies have called for removal of the Soviet `` army of occupation.'' But Sajudis' membership has grown to 150,000-200 ,000 in a population of 3.7 million in barely nine months It is backing candidates in virtually every electoral district of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s first multiple-candidate elections for Parliament. The vote to strive for an `` independent path'' for <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> passed the <ORGANIZATION> Sajudis </ORGANIZATION> assembly by a vote of about 204-8, with eight abstentions, said <PERSON> Alvydas </PERSON> <PERSON> Medalinskas </PERSON>, a spokesman for the group, in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>. `` It means full political, economic and legal sovereignty,'' he said. `` But we have many opinions on how to achieve this.'' The declaration states <ORGANIZATION> Sajudis </ORGANIZATION> will strive `` to create the conditions for free and democratic national self-determination,'' according to a text released by a Lithuanian emigre group in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. It also said <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> should be a neutral state in a European demilitarized zone. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> rejected any possibility of Lithuanian secession during a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> meeting with factory workers Wednesday, but his words were mild. `` Those who demand <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> secede from the U.S.S.R. are either people driven by personal or career ambitions, or simply extremists,'' he told K.M. Ashmonas of the shipyard in <LOCATION> Klaipeda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, according to Thursday's newspaper reports. `` They do not accept socialism at all, and to expect that they would protect our value, interests of workers and farmers is useless. Let us be calm, but let us give them a calm rebuke. Perestroika has to help us sort out and solve many problems.'' Lithuanians gathered in cities and towns across the republic for independence celebrations marked by songs, flowers, a Catholic Mass at a cathedral and ceremonies at the national cemetery where heroes of the war of independence are buried. A monument to freedom, which had been removed after the Soviet annexation, was rededicated with a flourish of doves. Just one year ago, celebrations of the anniversay ended when police beat hundreds of demonstrators with rubber truncheons. This year, the anniversary had government approval. <PERSON> Valdas </PERSON> <PERSON> Analauskas </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> activist and journalist, estimated the crowds in <LOCATION> Kaunas </LOCATION> at 100,000 and in <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> at 200,000, although <PERSON> Medalinskas </PERSON> said celebrants at the <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> rally numbered closer to 80,000. The head of the <ORGANIZATION> Lithuanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> even put in a surprise appearance at the <LOCATION> Kaunas </LOCATION> rally Thursday morning, <PERSON> Analauskas </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Algirdas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brazauskas </PERSON>, the party first secretary, offered a short speech calling for unity. <PERSON> Medalinskas </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sajudis </PERSON>' action was similar to nearby <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s `` declaration of sovereignty,'' but noted it was merely the vote of a grass-roots organization and not a governmental action like the Estonian constitutional amendments passed in November <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> gave itself the right to overturn Soviet laws. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> promptly declared that unconstitutional but has done nothing to halt <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> from selectively exercising its newly declared authority. The revival of Lithuanian nationalism has not been greeted unanimously in the republic, where 20 percent of the population is <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> or of other natinality. On Sunday, thousands of mostly Russian residents of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> gathered in central <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> to demonstrate against a new law defining Lithuanian as a state language. The crowd was estimated at 20,000 to 30,000 by <PERSON> Medalinskas </PERSON> and 100,000 by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda. The New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Lithuanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said eight Americans involved in emigre groups were denied visas to attend the celebrations. The center quoted government sources as saying <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> party leader <PERSON> Brazauskas </PERSON> approved the visas but they were rejected in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.

 Israeli troops shot and killed a Palestinian in a stone-throwing clash in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> Thursday and wounded eight others, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> doctors said. A 4-year-old Arab girl died of head injuries suffered in a mysterious explosion. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, doctors at <LOCATION> Ittihad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> said 25-year-old <PERSON> Issam </PERSON> <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulbul </PERSON> died of a chest wound suffered in a stone-throwing clash with soldiers. The army had no immediate comment. Arab reports said troops opened fire while pursuing Palestinians who hurled rocks at an army patrol in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>' <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The death raised to 381 the number of Palestinians killed in the 14-month rebellion against Israeli rule. Fifteen Israelis also have died. Palestinian doctors at east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mukassad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Iktimal </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tayasir </LOCATION> village in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> died of injuries suffered three days ago when a device she found near her home exploded. Her 10-year-old brother <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> was wounded. A military source confirmed the death. The army started an investigation Wednesday into that blast and into other unexplained explosions in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> that killed two other Palestinians and wounded eight. The air force also has been asked to look into the explosions after Palestinians reported seeing helicopters in the area of one incident. In other cases, Palestinians accused <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers in jeeps of throwing out explosive devices that lured unsuspecting children. The army denied it. The army deputy chief of staff, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Barak </PERSON>, has said previous explosions resulted from children playing with undetonated shells near firing ranges or flares that fell from training jets. The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> were captured by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> on Thursday raised the possibility of talks involving Palestinians from the occupied territories and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. He said on <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>'s Arabic-language program that Palestinian negotiators should be chosen in free elections and indicated he would be flexible about conditions, such as army withdrawal from voting areas on election days and guarantees that no one would interfere with the balloting. `` There may be different proposals, -LRB- Palestinian -RRB- committees, no army on election day in the areas where elections are held. There may be different ways to guarantee really free elections,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> on Thursday said West Germans must not forget the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> era and must prevent any possible resurgence of political extremism. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> also rejected opposition criticism that a West German history museum to be built in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> would gloss over the Nazi period because that era occurred before the federal republic's founding in 1949. `` We envision our history in its entirety, with all of its good as well as with its horrible sides,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said during a parliamentary debate. He proposed that ground be broken this year for the House of the Federal Republic of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s History, a project expected to cost $ 49 million. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> later made a speech in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> at the opening of an art exhibition marking <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s 40th birthday anniversary. In that speech, he stressed that West Germans must never forget the Nazi era and any tendencies toward radical political extremism from the right as well as the left must be opposed. `` We will not and must now allow the responsibility for this dark chapter of our history -LRB- the Nazi era -RRB- to be blotted out,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. `` This experience of German history should make it clear that we must always oppose extremism and the unleashing of irrational forces,'' he said. Much of <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s speech focused on <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s strengths, especially the country's successful rebuilding effort after the 1945 defeat of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` No one could have expected that in a very short time life would emerge from destruction, hope from despair, and a brand-new culture from unimaginable chaos,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s strong remarks seemed at least partially directed at opposition politicians who have charged the new <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> history museum, expected to open in the mid-1990s, would ignore the 1933-45 Nazi period. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said the museum would not present `` an officious, paved-over picture'' but a thorough and responsible portrayal of the nation and the events that have influenced it. In addition to the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> project, intended to present the past 40 years of history, the federal government has embarked on a larger undertaking in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to present the entire history of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and its peoples. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> plans 120 different celebrations and festivals this year to mark the country's 40th birthday.

 About 170 black detainees at a prison outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> halted a 24-day hunger strike Thursday and proclaimed victory, and anti-apartheid leaders said many detainees would be freed. In Port <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, however, civil rights workers said 105 detainees at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Albans </LOCATION> prison continued their fast. The hunger strikers at <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s Diepkloof Prison, some of whom had not eaten since Jan. 23, ended their fast at 7 a.m. `` An important victory has been won,'' they said in a statement. Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, after meeting in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> with Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>, said the government had pledged to free within two weeks a `` substantial number'' of the estimated 1,000 detainees held without charge nationwide. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> and other activist clergymen emerged from the meeting to urge a suspension of the hunger strike. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said a decision on whether to resume the protest would depend on how many detainees are freed. `` The burden is now on the shoulders of Mr. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said. `` Our goal is to get all the detainees released and then we will carry on to change the total structure of apartheid.'' <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> issued no statement, but his office described the talks as `` a victory for negotiation.'' The state radio said <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> gave permission to the Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, general-secretary of the South African Council of Churches, to visit the hunger strikers and discuss the developments. The church leaders said <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> promised to give urgent personal attention to the cases of individual detainees and told the delegation the death of any hunger striker would be `` too ghastly to contemplate.'' `` A very significant move has happened,'' said <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>. `` It has given hope to our people that non-violent action can in fact sometimes achieve goals they have set for themselves.'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> later received a standing ovation from about 1,500 people at a church service in support of the detainees. `` Never before has minister <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> and the government been shaking in their boots like they are today,'' said activist <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Carolus </PERSON>, who was at the service. As people left the service at the <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, they found a police water cannon truck, several vans, constables armed with shotguns, and a colonel warning them with a loudspeaker that they had two minutes to disperse or police would take action. An angry <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> spoke with the police colonel, saying, `` I'm going to see Mr. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> and tell him that your attitude is very unreasonable.'' <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Satchwell </PERSON>, a lawyer representing several hunger strikers, said in <LOCATION> Johannesbrug </LOCATION> that the government indicated a majority of the roughly 1,000 people detained nationwide would be freed soon. She said it was not clear how many of those released would be among the estimated 300 detainees at several prisons participating in the hunger strike. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Tambo </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement, said in <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, that the latest developments proved the strike was `` a jolly good idea.'' The Diepkloof detainees said their decision was based on concern for the health of some hunger strikers and on <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>'s pledge to review their cases. `` There have been broken promises in the past. We hope that this is not the case now,'' their statement said. `` We have succeeded in our principal objection ... to highlight the desperate plight of detainees.'' Ms. <PERSON> Satchwell </PERSON> said there was no specific assurance from the government about who would be freed. But she said officials had told her releases would begin immediately. Another lawyer, <PERSON> Azhar </PERSON> <PERSON> Cachalia </PERSON>, said detainees who had been fasting since the start of the strike would need several weeks to regain enough strength to go free. He said the government had given no indication it was considering ending its policy of detention without trial but was seeking a way to free a substantial number of detainees without losing face. An estimated 30,000 people, most of them black activists, have been detained for varying periods since a national state of emergency was declared in 1986. Among the clergymen who met with <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> was the Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, who had fasted since Monday. He said he was suspending his fast for two weeks because of the prospect of widespread releases. The detainees had threatened to starve themselves to death unless they were freed or put on trial. More than 20 had been hospitalized, and fears for their health were growing. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> had said the government can not be `` blackmailed'' by a hunger strike, but he met with civil rights lawyers, clergy and relatives of the strikers to discuss the crisis.

<TEXT>
 The nation suffered the worst pollution of the decade last summer with high ozone levels and 28 new cities were added to the list of urban areas where air quality violated federal standards, according to preliminary findings made public Thursday. The findings by the <ORGANIZATION> Enviromental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> were expected to be the focus of sharp questioning at a congressional hearing later this month on the effectiveness of federal air pollution laws. Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on health and environment, said the latest <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> data, released by his office, is expected to `` give a strong boost'' to efforts in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to tighten pollution control requirements According to the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> findings, two-thirds of the agency's 323 monitoring sites reported higher ozone pollution levels last summer than in any other summer this decade. The findings showed that where a comparison could be made, the average ozone pollution last summer was 5 percent greater than in l983, which has been widely regarded as the worst year this decade for ozone pollution. Average pollution last year was 14 percent higher when compared to l987, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said. During l988 there were 26 more metropolitan areas and two largely rural areas added to the list of cities that had pollution exceeding federal standards established by law. These areas had a combined population of nearly 15 million people. The information, collected by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> from state and local air pollution control agencies, covered the period from April through October, 1988, including one of the hottest summers, which officials said contributed to the high levels of ozone pollution. <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> said the latest data shows that serious air pollution and urban smog `` now afflicts almost every American city.'' He said more than 100 million Americans live in cities with higher levels of ozone and carbon monoxide pollution than is considered safe by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>. Carbon monoxide pollution comes from car, bus and truck exhausts, while ozone pollution is the result of these pollutants as well as industrial emissions. In a letter accompanying the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> air quality statistics, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>, the agency's acting assistant administrator for air and radiation, said that the data was preliminary and had not yet gone through `` the normal validation procedures.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it has created a special mobile fraud squad to conduct investigations at savings and loan institutions. The agency, which insures deposits at commercial banks, last week began taking control of more than 200 insolvent S & amp; Ls under orders from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Our new fraud squad will be dispatched to the scene whenever our on-sight teams discover evidence of fraud or insider abuse,'' <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said in a speech prepared for delivery to a group of accountants in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudine </PERSON>, a section chief in the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>'s division of bank supervision, will dispatch fraud teams selected from among 80 specially trained bank examiners. In another development, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION>, recommended Thursday the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration restructure the <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION> board of directors as part of its plan for the savings and loan crisis. <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION> was created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1970 to provide money for home mortgages by purchasing the mortgages, packaging them into securities and reselling them to investors. Currently, it is controlled by three directors who also comprise the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates savings and loan institutions. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed that the bank board be shrunk to one member, who would become an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The current <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION> board said it should be replaced by a 13-member board, chaired by the remaining bank board chairman. The other 12 board members would include four government officials, two presidential appointees, three members elected by public shareholders and three directors elected by the other 10 directors.

<HEAD>Close Friend Of Mitterrand Charged In Stock Scandal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A close friend of President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and four other people were charged Thursday in an insider trading scandal, judicial sources said. Roger-Patrice <PERSON> Pelat </PERSON> confirmed he was charged with receiving insider information that allowed him to buy shares of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company <ORGANIZATION> Triangle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> shortly before the state-owned aluminum maker <ORGANIZATION> Pechiney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> offered a higher price in a successful takeover. `` I am a bit surprised, but it seems that this is the normal procedure,'' <PERSON> Pelat </PERSON>, a retired businessman, told reporters after meeting with investigating Magistrate <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Boizette </PERSON>. Three men were charged with insider trading: <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> stockbrokers <PERSON> Pierre-Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavala </PERSON> and an officer in a <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> investment company, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiplinger </PERSON>, the judicial sources said on condition of anonymity. The sources said <PERSON> Pelat </PERSON> and a friend, <PERSON> Isabelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierco </PERSON>, were charged with receiving the information and profiting from it. The charge carries the same maximum penalty as insider trading: two years in prison and a fine of up to four times the amount illicitly gained in the deal. <PERSON> Pelat </PERSON>, 70, bought 10,000 shares of Triangle stock for himself, his wife and his two sons on Nov. 16, half for $ 10 a share and half for $ 10.75 a share. At that time, <ORGANIZATION> Pechiney </ORGANIZATION>'s takeover offer of $ 56 per share had been negotiated and submitted to senior <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> government officials for approval. The bid was made public on Nov. 21, sending <ORGANIZATION> Triangle </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price soaring <PERSON> Pelat </PERSON> sold his and his family's shares during the following week, getting more than four times the price he had just paid, for a total profit of about $ 350,000. In a televised interview Sunday, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said he knew <PERSON> Pelat </PERSON> as a man of courage and integrity from their years together in the French resistance, and before that in a German prisoner of war camp in 1940. `` We were a small group who remained very close. It is rare that prisoners of war, in such circumstances of misery and solitude, show as much strength of soul, character and friendship'' as <PERSON> Pelat </PERSON> did, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said. But he said if <PERSON> Pelat </PERSON> were found guilty of an offense, `` then in my role as president I would not be able to maintain the same kind of friendship I have had with him for so long.'' On Wednesday, <PERSON> Pelat </PERSON> resigned from the board of directors of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION>, a spokeswoman for the state-owned airline confirmed Thursday. <PERSON> Pelat </PERSON> has said he was tipped to buy Triangle stock by a friend, <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Theret </PERSON>, a businessman with longstanding ties to the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Theret, who bought 32,300 Triangle shares the day before <PERSON> Pelat </PERSON>'s purchase, said he came up with the idea from his own stock research and denied getting inside information. Theret has not been charged. He has been hospitalized in recent weeks with a heart ailment, and French law requires that an investigating magistrate notify a suspect face-to-face of criminal charges.

<TEXT>
 The lawyer for <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s lover asked a jury Thursday to double its $ 14.5 million award as a message to the world that those with AIDS have a duty to warn their sexual partners. `` If you bring in a verdict like the one you brought in yesterday, you know the world is going to know about it,'' said attorney <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON>, arguing in the second phase of the precedent-setting civil trial. Jurors began deliberating the issue of punitive and exemplary damages after receiving legal instructions from <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Geernaert </PERSON>. The panel met for 2 -LCB- hours before retiring, and was to resume Friday morning. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> called the jurors' decision Wednesday in favor of <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> `` magnificent,'' and predicted that further damages would produce headlines reading: `` Rock Hudson Jury Does It Again.'' The jury award was believed to be the first to a plaintiff who had not developed any signs of AIDS infection. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> urged jurors to assess another $ 14.5 million in exemplary and punitive damages against <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s secretary and confidant <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who the jury found helped the actor conceal the sexually transmitted, fatal disease from his lover. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was held liable for actual damages Wednesday along with the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> estate. Arguments for additional damages focused only on <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> because the law bars awarding punitive or exemplary damages from the estate of a dead person. `` There are countless millions of people involved, people who may benefit by your verdict, if it makes an example of <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said. He said that those with AIDS would no longer keep it secret from their sex partners if they knew it could result in a huge damage award. `` The message has been sent,'' countered <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Banks </PERSON>. `` It's echoed around the world. Now please exercise caution.'' <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> sued on grounds that he suffered emotional distress and `` enhanced fear'' that he might contract AIDS. He consistently has tested negative for presence of the AIDS virus, but his lawyer says that is no guarantee that he will not develop AIDS in the future. Banks asked jurors not to vent any anger they feel toward <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> on <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. `` He's not the person who had sex with <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>,'' the lawyer said. `` If you're angry at <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, I ask you to set all the feelings about <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> aside and consider <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. There is no need to hit <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> again. ... The purpose is not to be mean spirited or evil.'' Jurors found Wednesday that both <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> were guilty of `` outrageous conduct'' for withholding the movie star's AIDS diagnosis from the young man who shared his bed for two years. The jurors heard seven weeks of often explicit testimony about the late star's sex life, and their award exceeded the amount Christian had sought in compensatory damages by $ 3.5 million. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> testified that his assets total less than $ 100,000, and his lawyer said the award Wednesday `` has wiped him out.'' <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> disputed that, but <PERSON> Geernaert </PERSON> toldf jurors to disregard both attorneys' comments concerning <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s net worth. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> has said that <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> stands to inherit millions from the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> will. It also has been suggested that he may be insured for a portion of the verdict. Christian, 35, an aspiring musician, testified that he became <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s live-in lover in 1983 and did n't learn that the actor had AIDS until it was announced to the world in July 1985. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> died Oct. 5, 1985, at age 58.

 Damage to the pristine Antarctic environment from an Argentine ship that ran aground and leaked oil appears to be less than initially feared, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> scientist reported Thursday. `` There were not thousands of birds killed. What we saw was the death of a few birds and there may be more,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLaca </PERSON>, chief of the Division of Polar Programs of the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. `` Some said this was an eco-catastrophe of biblical proportions. That clearly is not true. Others said it was nothing. That's not true, either. The truth is somewhere in between.'' Many krill, a small, shrimplike crustacean that is the main food for whalebone whales, washed up on islands after the <ORGANIZATION> Bahia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paraiso </ORGANIZATION> ran aground on Jan. 28 and began leaking fuel oil. The Argentine navy oceanographic vessel had been chartered for a tourist excursion. The accident took place near the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> polar research station <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> on the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, 600 miles below the tip of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> DeLaca </PERSON> was on the scene and helped organize the transfer of tourists from ship to land by motorized rubber boats. The partially submerged ship was carrying an estimated 800 tons of diesel oil, butane, compressed gas and other fuel, which immediately began to leak. How much leaked and how much will be recovered was not known, <PERSON> DeLaca </PERSON> said. He said some penguins and cormorants died after ingesting oil or getting it on themselves, and thousands of limpets, a small, marine animal, also died. However, navy experts from <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> and scientists aboard the foundation vessel Polar <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> quickly recovered floating fuel canisters, patched the <ORGANIZATION> Bahia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paraiso </ORGANIZATION>'s hull, stopped the leak and contained the spill and now are cleaning it up. `` For the most part, the stuff that went into the water seems to have dispersed and gone away,'' <PERSON> DeLaca </PERSON>, a bearded, 45-year-old marine microbiologist, said in an interview. The concern now is what possible long-term effects the spill may have on animal and plant life and on research such as that conducted at <LOCATION> Palmer </LOCATION> since 1970. `` The Antarctic is a hostile, unforgiving environment,'' <PERSON> DeLaca </PERSON> said. `` The organisms that live there are specially adapted. The margins for survival are narrow. ... Anything that takes away an edge, that compromises their fitness, could mean the difference between life and death.'' He said ingesting oil may affect the penguins' capacity to store oxygen and thus their ability to dive deep for food. Oil on the feathers of skuas, a large predator bird related to the seagull, could affect their ability to float or stay warm. Lack of limpets and krill near a nesting may affect breeding patterns and the ability of young creatures to survive, he said. He said researchers also will wonder now whether the results they obtain are valid, or a reflection of the oil spill. `` This is the first significant spill in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> DeLaca </PERSON> said. `` It was a pristine environment and experimental results were taken as accurate indicators of the Antarctic environment. This spill could call into question future results.'' A team of scientists from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> will arrive at <LOCATION> Palmer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> next month to collect data before winter sets in. `` When next spring comes is when the story will be told'' about the damage caused by the spill, <PERSON> DeLaca </PERSON> said. `` The environment will recover. No question about that. The question is, is what comes back what was there before.''

<HEAD>Former City Officials Convicted In Settlement Of Voting Rights Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DANVILLE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Five former city officials have been convicted of illegally guaranteeing themselves jobs as part of a settlement of a federal voting rights lawsuit, a prosecutor said Thursday. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> DeArmond </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Vermilion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state's attorney who prosecuted the non-jury criminal case in December, announced the decision, which Circuit Judge <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Komada </PERSON> issued in writing earlier this week. The charges resulted from an agreement in 1987 to do away with city's system of electing commissioners at large, which blacks challenged as discriminatory. While instituting a ward system of electing aldermen, the settlement also kept the four commissioners on the municipal payroll for three years as executives. The former commissioners, <PERSON> Wilbur </PERSON> <PERSON> Scharlau </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Randall </PERSON>, were convicted, along with city attorney <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of charges including official misconduct and conflict of interest. `` You ca n't commit state crimes while settling a federal voting-rights case,'' said <PERSON> DeArmond </PERSON>. `` Our quarrel was with the guarantee of jobs to themselves. That's self-dealing ... illegal.'' `` Generally, I'm disappointed. I think it is the intention of the defendants to appeal,'' said defense attorney <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Laury </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> have resigned their city jobs. Scharlau and <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> remained on the payroll. <PERSON> DeArmond </PERSON> said the men could face a maximum sentence of five years in prison. A sentencing hearing is scheduled for April 7. When the men were indicted in July 1987, defense attorney <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Lydon </PERSON> contended they had negotiated in good faith to reach a voting rights settlement that would assure a smooth transition in the city government. He also noted that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION> had approved the settlement. `` The bottom line was regardless of their motivation ... everything was done in a federal court case and presented to the court to determine whether it was proper,'' <PERSON> Laury </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> set the indictments aside in August 1987. But the 7th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> reinstated them last April, saying <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> `` probably did not mean to approve the manner of negotiation,'' just the substance of the settlement. The Rev. <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, one of the black residents who filed the suit, has said that the plaintiffs did not want the former commissioners guaranteed city jobs for three years. However, he said that was necessary in order to gain the settlement. Before the settlement, no black had been elected to the city council in the 60 years the mayor-commissioner system was in place. About 16 percent of <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>'s 39,000 residents are black. After the mayor-aldermanic form of government began, 14 people, including two blacks, were elected to the city council from seven wards.

 The 33-nation council of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> aviation agency Thursday ordered an urgent study of whether new measures are needed to meet the security threat posed by terrorist sabotage. At a meeting requested by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> council </ORGANIZATION> condemned `` all acts of unlawful interference against international civil aviation,'' including the Dec. 21 bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 that killed all 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British transportation secretaries told reporters they considered the two-day meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> ICAO </ORGANIZATION> advisory body successful and were satisfied there would be a quick review of security requirements. <PERSON> Samual </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said: `` The international airline traveler can be assured that additional steps are now being taken, as a result of this meeting, to make international air travel an even safer mode of transportation.'' Among issues to be addressed in the review are detecting sabotage devices, especially explosives, and screening of checked luggage, passengers and carry-on bags. Security problems created by portable radios, computers and other. Recommendations for any changes in international standards could be ready bu late spring or early summer for consideration by the <ORGANIZATION> ICAO </ORGANIZATION> membership of 160 nations. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON>, the British transportation secretary, suggested a rule requiring passengers with electronic devices to carry them onto the plane rather than checking them. `` To ban radios altogether would be a very drastic step,'' but it might have to be considered, he said. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said new guidance was issued in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after Thursday's announcement in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> `` The guidance is more a sense of vigilance than anything else,'' he told reporters. Although passengers can expect electronic devices to be checked more rigorously, an outright ban on carrying them is unlikely, <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> said the costs of increased security might eventually be reflected in increased ticket prices, but `` we're not talking about large sums of money.'' The organization's staff also will be considering whether new steps are needed to increase the matching of passengers and their bags, to consider the security problem of cargo, mail and courier services using passenger aircraft and to control access to airports. It also will be discussing the possibility of taking security considerations into account in the design of aircraft. <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> said, however, that any design changes would be minor.

 Psychiatrists could not have predicted that a former mental patient would suddenly become homicidal, the head of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s hospital for the criminally insane said Thursday. `` I do n't think anyone had the capacity a week ago to predict his actions,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Siebert </PERSON>. But Wednesday afternoon, <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON>, a former patient at the <ORGANIZATION> Clifton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Perkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> walked onto the seventh floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Chevy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, Md. where he worked, shot four co-workers and then turned the gun on himself, according to <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police. Fatally wounded were <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Landover </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Tanya </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Mahasty </PERSON> <PERSON> Agha-Khan </PERSON>, 29, of Silver Spring. The lone survivor of the shooting spree, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 22, was listed in critical condition at <LOCATION> Suburban </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION> with a gunshot wound to the face. Police spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludington </PERSON> said investigators were probing reports that <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> was a `` disgruntled employee,'' in the bank's Visa credit card department but said the motive for the shooting has not been determined As recently as Feb. 6, the therapist who had been seeing <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> biweekly since he was released from the hospital more than two years ago said the 33-year-old debt collector was functioning well in the community. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Siebert </PERSON> said no mistakes were made in the decision to release <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> from <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> in the fall of 1986. `` I have not found anything which would make me question the release decision which was made two years ago,'' he said, explaining that <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> was never violent to others during his two-year stay at the facility. <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> was sent to <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> in April 1984, after he approached a policeman with a knife, pleading with the officer to kill him and a county circuit judge ruled that <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> was not criminally responsible for his action, said <PERSON> Siebert </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON>'s release came after he was evaluated by a treatment team, an outside mental health professional reviewed the decision and the judge who originally sent him to the institution was notified. <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> had been seen regularly by a psychiatrist and a social worker since his release, and had stayed in several halfway houses before moving into an apartment in Silver Spring, according to <PERSON> Siebert </PERSON>. However <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> had suffered some setbacks, <PERSON> Siebert </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> was admitted to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Adventist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> for a week for treatment of depression last spring, hospital officials said. And in July, the Community Forensic Aftercare Office notified the <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney's Office that <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> was not keeping his clinic appointments at <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a residential halfway house in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> where he was scheduled for counseling. However hospital officials said <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> had resumed his couseling, and just last week his therapist reported <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> was complying with the terms of his conditional release. <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> had been briefly hospitalized for mental problems five times before, <PERSON> Siebert </PERSON> said, dating back to the late 1970s when he reported hearing voices while still in his native <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> had been diagnosed primarily with depression, but <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeths </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where he stayed for three days in July 1983, diagnosed him as suffering schizoaffective disorder. At <LOCATION> Perkins </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> was diagnosed as suffering from bipolar syndrome or manic depression which was characterized by bouts of extreme depression, said <PERSON> Siebert </PERSON>. One person in 20 suffers from some type of bilopar syndrome, <PERSON> Siebert </PERSON> said, and 99 percent never perform a violent act, according to <PERSON> Siebert </PERSON>. <PERSON> Siebert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, an attorney assigned to <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> by the State's Attorney's office, insisted <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON> also had never demonstrated violent tendencies. `` He was in for a suicidal gesture, not violent behavior,'' said <PERSON> Siebert </PERSON>. During <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON>'s two years at <LOCATION> Perkins </LOCATION>, he was involved in scuffles just three times, and he was never the instigator, <PERSON> Siebert </PERSON> said. `` If we have an inkling that a person is going to be a risk to a co-worker or employer, we would never recommend that person for release,'' <PERSON> Siebert </PERSON> said. `` I do not have a good explanation for the criminal behavior yesterday,'' said <PERSON> Siebert </PERSON>, adding there also was no way to know if <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON>'s actions were related to his prior mental problems. Ms. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the bank was n't notified of <PERSON> Tsegaye </PERSON>'s history because he was n't considered a danger and state law does n't require notification. Authorities are n't sure how <PERSON> Tesgaye </PERSON>, with a background of mental illness, was able to obtain a gun. <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> has begun an intensive review into the incident, with the help of outside consultants, <PERSON> Siebert </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Miners across <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> staged a daylong strike Thursday to protest the slaying of labor leader <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantoral </PERSON> and said he was killed by a guerrilla group linked to the governemnt. Also Thursday, police said Maoist Shining Path guerrillas killed one policeman and wounded two in an attack a day earlier on a police post near <LOCATION> Chincha </LOCATION>, 100 miles south of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. Other Maoist rebels shot and killed a former governing party economic development worker in <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION>, 140 miles east of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, police said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, an organization of mine owners, said it could not confirm how many of the nation's estimated 70,000 miners stayed off the job Thursday. Cantoral, secretary-general of the leftist-led miners' federation and one of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s most powerful labor leaders, was shot to death late Monday. A female companion was run down by a car and killed in a <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> slum. Government officials blamed the killings on political extremists and said an investigation was under way to determine if the attackers were from the Shining Path, the anti-rebel group <ORGANIZATION> Rodrigo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Franco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, or an ultra-right death squad not previously known. The miners' federation accused the <ORGANIZATION> Rodrigo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Franco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> of carrying out the attack, and it linked the group to the governing center-left <ORGANIZATION> Aprista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The government has denied any connection with the Franco band, which emerged a year ago vowing to kill leftist guerrillas and their supporters. Cantoral, 42, became the focus of controversy last year when he led miners in two crippling national strikes. The walkouts caused losses of $ 400 million, one-third of the annual exports from <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s most important industry The strikes failed to force mine owners to accept a federation demand that labor contracts of mine unions be negotiated jointly rather than on the current union-by-union basis. The mine owners charged repeatedly that the strikes were being manipulated by the Shining Path, which officials said has begun to infiltrate labor unions. The federation in January decided to strike again over labor contracts. Federation spokesman <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said Thursday the strike is tentatively set for sometime in March.

 A military judge on Thursday dropped one of three charges against a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> captain accused of abandoning scores of Vietnamese refugees who later resorted to cannibalism to survive at sea. The judge ruled prosecutors failed to present evidence that Capt. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Balian </PERSON>, former skipper of the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION>, refused to assist a man who tried to swim to the warship when it crossed paths with the refugee boat on June 9. <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> faces another charge of `` wrongfully failing to render assistance'' to a second Vietnamese who also tried to swim to the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION>, and a third charge of dereliction of duty for failing to render adequate assistance to the other refugees. If convicted, <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> could be sentenced to two years and three months in jail, forfeiture of all benefits and dismissal from the service. The military judge, Capt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Freyer </PERSON>, ordered the first charge dropped on a motion of defense lawyer <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Donato </PERSON> as soon as the prosecution rested its case on the fifth day of <PERSON> Balian </PERSON>'s court-martial The <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> was en route to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> when it encountered the refugee boat 230 miles north of the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Palawan </LOCATION>. The boat, crammed with 83 Vietnamese, had been at sea since leaving <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on May 22. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> said nearly 20 other refugees died of starvation before the encounter with the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> and only 52 survived when the `` boat people'' were rescued by Filipino fishermen on June 27. The survivors told officials that after provisions given by the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> crew ran out, they survived by eating the flesh of five refugees, including three who were slain. <PERSON> Balian </PERSON>, 48, of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, was relieved of his command in August. Court-martial charges were filed in December. In addition to dropping the first charge, the judge also instructed the six <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> captains who sit as the jury to ignore one of 11 allegations to back up the dereliction charge, which is punishable with three months in prison. The allegation was that <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> had failed to provide the refugees with medical supplies. Witnesses who testified earlier said the refugees replied to repeated questions that no one among them was sick. The other allegations backing the dereliction charge include failure to adequately inspect the refugee vessel for its seaworthiness. On Wednesday, a witness testified he saw four Vietnamese jump from their boat and swim toward the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION>. Three of them swam back when they saw two rubber boats from the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> approaching their craft with food supplies. The prosecution says at least two Vietnamese drowned. But the witness, <PERSON> Ensign </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Esperum </PERSON>, testified <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> gave orders to check the floating body of the Vietnamese to `` make sure he is not faking it.'' He added he observed `` no movement'' in the body and it was left at sea.

<HEAD>U.S. Air Force Cancels Air Shows In West Germany For 1989</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Six months after a fiery air show crash at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> base killed 70 people, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it had canceled all its air shows in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> this year. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Capt. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Krejcarek </PERSON> said the decision by Commanding Gen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> applies to all flyovers and aerial demonstrations for the general public at <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> installations in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. On Aug. 28, three Italian stunt jets collided in flight over the <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, and one of the flaming planes plowed into a crowd of spectators. In addition to the 70 killed, hundreds of people were injured. That crash, and a series of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> training flight crashes in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> last year that killed more than 100 people, caused a public outcry and demands for a stop to low-level military flights throughout the country. In a telephone interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Krejcarek </PERSON> said the order also applies to `` open houses for the public,'' events regularly staged in the past by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> to permit Germans to familiarize themselves with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. However, <PERSON> Krejcarek </PERSON> said some air installations still may stage displays of aircraft for members of the military and `` invited guests only.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military's unofficial <ORGANIZATION> Stars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stripes </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported Thursday that the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> parties in the <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION> area had stepped up their campaign against air shows by circulating petitions and writing letters to newspapers and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. The newspaper quoted <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Divivier </PERSON> as saying <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>'s move was `` a wise and good decision.'' <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION> is about 65 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rolled out its big guns Thursday _ President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ to keep a former <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klan </PERSON> leader from being elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> as a member of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>. Letters touting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s endorsement of ex-Klansman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s opponent in the state House race were circulated throughout the district, while radio commercials featuring <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s familiar voice were broadcast throughout the day `` I ca n't help but tell you of the high regard I have for one candidate in the race for the 81st district _ <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Treen </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in the radio spot for the conservative house builder and longtime Republican. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, 38, countered with a paid half-hour broadcast on a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> television in which he declared that neither <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> knows anything about the issues in the local race. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has n't walked in the Irish-Italian parade as I have down <LOCATION> Metairie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has n't eaten at the lakefront in <LOCATION> Bucktown </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said. `` I know the people of the district _ not <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. I respect both of those men but all I can respond is ... read my lips, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. No new taxes, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> basically has the same kind of program that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has advanced.'' <PERSON> Treen </PERSON>, 63, and <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, a former grand wizard of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>, are in a runoff Saturday to represent the nearly all-white district in <LOCATION> Metairie </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> suburb. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, who sought the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination but registered Republican in the fall, led a field of seven candidates with 33 percent of the vote in the Jan. 21 primary. <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> had 19 percent. Under <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s open primary system, the top two vote-getters in a primary, regardless of party, face each other in the runoff if no candidate gets half the primary votes. The seat opened when <LOCATION> Metairie </LOCATION>'s representative was elected to a judgeship. The presidential-level endorsements for a state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat may have unprecedented. `` This is the first time for sure that <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has ever done it to my knowledge for a state legislative race,'' said state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Nungesser </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did n't mention <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> in their endorsements, but state and national <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> officials made it clear that a <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> victory would harm the party. `` It's as if <PERSON> Attila </PERSON> <PERSON> the </PERSON> <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> joined our party,'' said <PERSON> Nungesser </PERSON>. `` All of the sudden Attila the <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> is a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate. I do n't believe he's changed one bit.'' `` He is not a Republican and should not pass himself off to be a Republican,'' said <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We can tolerate a lot in this party, but the one thing we can not tolerate is intolerance.'' `` It has to be political favors being called in,'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said after <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> received the presidential endorsements. `` I'm really tired of this. The outside interference in this race is absolutely ridiculous. It's like the establishment is closing the ranks to prevent an independent from coming through.'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> has been campaigning door to door this week as publicity heated up in the race. <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> said he received the endorsement from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> after a mutual friend whom he would not identify asked the former president to get involved. <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> was state campaign chairman for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 1980 presidential bid. His brother, <PERSON> Dave </PERSON>, was <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> governor from 1980 to 1984. The commercials were paid for by <PERSON> Treen </PERSON>'s campaign. Neither <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Nungesser </PERSON> would say how much they cost. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> has disavowed the Klan, which he said he left in 1980 after being accused of selling secret membership rolls. He heads a group called the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, which he says is not racist but a group seeking human rights for everybody. He is opposed to welfare and affirmative action and supports <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s $ 75,000 homestead tax exemption.

<HEAD>Searle Motion For New Trial Denied In $8.15 Million Copper-7 Verdict</HEAD>

 A federal judge Thursday refused to overturn an $ 8.15 million award against the <ORGANIZATION> G.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Searle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in the case of a woman who said her infertility was caused by a Searle birth control device. <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> asked for a new trial, claiming juror misconduct, errors of evidence and excessive punitive damages. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury last September ordered <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> to pay $ 8.15 million to <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Kociemba </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Elk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The verdict supported her claim that a Searle Copper-7 intrauterine birth control device had triggered a pelvic infection that left her infertile. `` Searle clearly believes that a new trial was warranted based on the evidence of jury misconduct,'' the company said in a statement after Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Renner </PERSON> issued his ruling. <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Skokie </LOCATION><LOCATION> , </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, said it would appeal <PERSON> Renner </PERSON>'s decision to the 8th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. In denying <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>'s motions for a new trial, <PERSON> Renner </PERSON> said the court does not condone improper actions of the jurors. However, he added, `` after reviewing the record and hearing the testimony of the individual jurors, the court concludes that the defendant was not denied a fair trial.'' The judge said he did not find the verdict excessive. The jury verdict was the first award of punitive damages against <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> for a Copper-7-related illness and it was the largest award. About 500 lawsuits have been filed over the Copper-7, the most widely used IUD in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> before it was withdrawn from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market in January 1986.

<HEAD>Police Arrest American Suspected of Spying on Judge For Scientologists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police on Thursday arrested an American suspected of acting on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientology </ORGANIZATION> to investigate the private life of a judge looking into fraud and tax evasion charges against the church here. A police spokesman said police arrested <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontana </PERSON>, 33, a native of <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> and reportedly a Church of Scientology member, and confiscated three dossiers containing information of a confidential nature. No hometown was available for <PERSON> Fontana </PERSON>, the spokesman said on condition of anonymity. Other charges against the Scientology members involve criminal association. The judge has said that Narconon, a church-linked drug rehabilitation program, swindled its clients and lured them into Scientology. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> told reporters police raided his office and home Thursday and removed papers from his home. The spokesman said dossiers confiscated from <LOCATION> Fontana </LOCATION> contained information pertaining to District Court Judge <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Honrubia </PERSON> and to <PERSON> Pilar </PERSON> <PERSON> Salarullana </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and an expert on religious sects active in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. He said the arrest came on the judge's orders after <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Honrubia </PERSON> learned that the church purportedly hired a Barcelona-based detective agency to look into his private affairs. After a nine-month investigation into Scientiology activities in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> last year, <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Honrubia </PERSON> ordered a raid Nov. 20 on a meeting of church officials in a <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> hotel. Seventy-one people were arrested, including <PERSON> Heber </PERSON> <PERSON> Jentzsch </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientology </ORGANIZATION>. After questioning all those arrested, the judge ordered 10 foreigners expelled and 50 others released. He released <PERSON> Jentzsch </PERSON> and the remaining 10 from two <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> prisons on Dec. 10 after they posted total bail of $ 1.1 million and agreed to remain in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and report before the court three times a week. <PERSON> Jentzsch </PERSON>, 53, a native of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and a resident of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, has repeatedly denied any personal wrongdoing in comments to reporters. Ms. <PERSON> Salarullana </PERSON> told reporters on Thursday that <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Honrubia </PERSON> showed her one confiscated dossier that contained data on her bank accounts, family documents, photos and public comments she has made concerning the Scientology church and sects active in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. Contacted at home by telephone, <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Honrubia </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fontana </ORGANIZATION> would stay in jail at least overnight until the judge could question him about the dossiers and decide if <PERSON> Fontana </PERSON> was to be released or held pending further investigation. Under Spanish law, a suspect can be held for 72 hours before being formally arraigned.

 The sunshine that peeked through on Thursday only illuminated the swirling, muddy water that has covered much of central and western <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> in the worst flooding in more than a decade. `` I feel confident that in almost all areas, that the situation has stabilized,'' said <PERSON> Ronn </PERSON> <PERSON> Padgett </PERSON>, of the state Division of Disaster and <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. Almost every river, creek and stream in the western two-thirds of the state was sent out of its banks with rain that topped 10 inches in some places. Flooding sent hundreds of people out of their homes, and roads were closed by high water in 82 of the state's 120 counties. Some roads reopened Thursday as waters receded. Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, who took a helicopter tour of some affected areas Thursday afternoon, said the state had had more than its share of bad luck recently with the summer drought in 1988 and now the flooding. `` If you have a nice, effective prayer you can say for us, you can say it,'' he said. Officials hoped for a respite with a weather forecast that contained little chance of rain until Friday. `` It sure looks like it's over, barring anything unforeseen,'' said <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Beauvois </PERSON>, forecaster for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>. He said the forecast called for one-fourth to one-half inch of rain or less on Friday. A state of emergency remained in effect Thursday with nearly 200 National Guard troops patrolling flooded areas to provide security to abandoned property. Guardsmen were also involved in two rescues near <LOCATION> Frankfort </LOCATION>. Sgt. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> waded in water up to his chest to a group of stranded campers, and Sgt. <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> saved a woman and child whose pickup truck was being carried away in the swollen <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Adjutant General <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> said troops would remain on duty as long as needed, but added, `` My gut feeling is we're over the hump on this.'' The hardest hit area was in <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> border, where nearly 300 people were evacuated. <LOCATION> Pendleton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, in northern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, had more than 100 people evacuated. `` I've cried and I've prayed, but I guess the Lord was n't ready to answer our prayer,'' said <PERSON> Elma </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Troutman </PERSON> of <PERSON> Calhoun </PERSON>, whose her trailer home was hauled away from rising waters of the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Frankfort </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> was expected to crest at 44 feet, more than 10 feet above flood stage but about 5 feet lower than the devastating flood of 1978. At a <LOCATION> Jim </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beam </LOCATION> distillery in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> south of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, workers were brought in by boat Thursday, said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON>, spokeswoman at the company's <LOCATION> Clermont </LOCATION> headquarters. `` That's the only way to get in and out,'' she said. The plant, which has a flood-control system to keep water out of the plant, continued to operate at full capacity, she said. In <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, Gov. <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> McWherter </PERSON> on Thursday asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to designate eight <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> counties as flood disaster areas. The request is based on flooding Tuesday in <LOCATION> Wilson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where damanges were estimated at $ 1.9 million. Under federal disaster guidelines, all adjoining counties also become eligible when a disaster designation is made. A report by the <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> showed 66 businesses and 28 homes in the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> area sustained flood damage. All but 14 businesses and nine homes were without flood insurance. The uninsured loss was estimated at $ 1.6 million.

 Leftist guerrillas attacked six military posts on Thursday, killing at least 12 soldiers and wounding 14, the military said. The fighting between rebels and troops was the first since Jan. 24, when the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> said it would participate in elections if they were delayed six months. The government said it opposed to the proposal. Also Thursday, a former guerrilla commander was fatally shot on a downtown street in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, police and government sources said. His attackers were unknown. Slain was <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castellanos </PERSON>, 39, who turned against his comrades after his capture in 1985 and then worked for the government as an anti-guerrilla propagandist. In 1986, he testified before the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that Salvadoran insurgents received arms shipments from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Castellanos </PERSON>, also known as <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, was director of the government-affiliated Center for Studies of the National Reality. Police and government sources said on condition of anonymity that two vehicles carrying assailants intercepted the car in which <PERSON> Castellanos </PERSON> was traveling near the downtown <PERSON> Flor </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanca </PERSON> soccer stadium. They said <PERSON> Castellanos </PERSON>' car was riddled with scores of bullets from assault rifles. He was killed instantly and driver and bodyguard were wounded, the sources said. About 60 guerrillas attacked the army base at the <PERSON> Entre </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> cotton cooperative outside <LOCATION> Zacatecoluca </LOCATION> with mortar and rifle fire, said Col. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Canjura </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> detachment in <LOCATION> Zacatecoluca </LOCATION>, 22 miles southeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Canjura </PERSON> told a news conference that nine soldiers were killed and 11 wounded during the two-hour attack that began at 2 a.m. He said the rebels had many casualties, but he said he could not provide figures. The Marxist-led insurgents also launched four bombs at the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> 6th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> brigade in <LOCATION> Usulutan </LOCATION>, 68 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, Col. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Tejada </PERSON> said by telephone. They also launched four bombs at the headquarters of the elite Atonal battalion about a mile from the 6th brigade, he said. Three bombs cleared the wall around the headquarters, but did not explode, he said. The one that fell outside the base exploded beside a house, wounding two civilians, he said. <PERSON> Canjura </PERSON> said rebels also attacked before dawn Civil Defense posts in <LOCATION> Jerusalen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ostuma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Barrio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nuevo </LOCATION>, three small towns in his central military region. He said three soldiers were killed and three wounded in those attacks. Army troops guard warehouses of large coffee, cotton and sugar cane plantations, which are <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s main foreign exchange earners. Rebels waging a 9-year-old civil war against the U.S.-backed government try to destroy the products as part of their strategy of economic sabotage. The guerrillas, in a drastic turnabout, offered last month to participate in this year's presidential election and respect its result if the vote were postponed from March 19 to September. The rebels had boycotted and condemned as sham the five previous national elections this decade. They sharply reduced their offensives while the proposal was being debated.

Moslems say the allegorical novel offends their faith by satirizing the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> as fallible; implying that Islam is not the only true religion; portraying <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s wives as prostitutes; and suggesting he wrote the Koran, rather than receiving it from God. The British <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> summoned <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s lone diplomat in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, told him <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s threat was `` totally unacceptable,'' demanded special protection for its <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, and froze plans to expand diplomatic relations with the Islamic state. `` We recognize that Moslems and others may have strong views about the contents of Mr. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book,'' <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said after his office summoned Iranian Charge d'Affaires <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Basti </PERSON>. `` However, nobody has the right to incite people to violence on British soil or against British citizens. <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s statement is totally unacceptable. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> stopped short of threatening to break diplomatic relations. But in an address to a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> luncheon he said `` a stable and serious relationship ... will not be possible while <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> fails to respect international standards of behavior.'' <PERSON> Basti </PERSON> emerged from the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in defiant mood, saying <PERSON> Rushie </PERSON>'s `` infamous book'' has had `` appalling consequences in some Islamic countries.'' `` It is a decree, it is a verdict after careful consideration,'' he said of the death sentence. `` It has nothing to do with any particular country.'' On Wednesday, protesters stoned the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> reopened the embassy in December after an eight-year closure, and intended to appoint an ambassador and have more than 12 diplomats, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, an anonymous caller to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> threatened to bomb British flights unless <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> emerged from hiding. At <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> immediately tightened security with bag-by-bag searches of luggage of passengers on its Thursday evening flights to the Indian sub-continent and the Far East. Air <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, another British-owned airline with flights to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, said it was taking the threat seriously. Amid a growing international furor, the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> government called in the British and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ambassadors and demanded that all copies of the book be destroyed. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and several other countries banned the book. Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> reached agreement with her right-wing opposition in January on a parliamentary resolution upholding the ban. <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said religious figures in the northwestern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Urumiyeh </LOCATION> said in a statement, `` We have already put on our death shrouds and pledge to carry out the Imam's -LRB- <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s -RRB- death sentence against <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> and his publishers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' The broadcast followed reports that other death squads were headed to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> from Islamic countries in search of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, a 41-year-old Moslem. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> dropped out of sight soon after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> announced the death sentence on Tuesday on him and <PERSON> Viking </PERSON>, his publishers in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The $ 2.6 million bounty offered by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was matched by <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashemian </PERSON>, religious leader in the southwestern city of <LOCATION> Kerman </LOCATION>, who offered the cash reward `` to any group or individual who carries out the death sentence on <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> and his publishers.'' That brought the total bounty to $ 5.2 million. Non-Iranians would be paid $ 1 million if they got to <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> first. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was `` appalled by the death threats against <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> by the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, as well as a subsequent offer of a reward for his murder.'' `` Such threats are completely irresponsible and are incompatible with basic standards of international conduct,'' he said, adding that he did not see how `` this in any way could improve the prospects'' for U.S.-Iranian relations. In the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, where he is on a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> tour, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> called the death threats `` regrettable.'' <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hossam-el-Din </PERSON>, a leading Islamic theologian in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> erred in sending death squads after <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> because executing him would be `` virtually impossible'' under the tenets of Islam. <PERSON> Hossam-el-Din </PERSON> said in an interview that nobody has been executed in <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s 1,350-year history as an apostate, which he interpreted as the crime that <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> invoked in issuing his sentence against <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> said only that the Indian-born author deserved to die for insulting Islam. In other developments: _ The <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> government said it was `` shocked'' at the death threat and Dutch Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> den </PERSON> <PERSON> Broek </PERSON> canceled a trip to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. _ Italian publishers <ORGANIZATION> Arnoldo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mondadori </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spa </ORGANIZATION> said they would go head with a contract to release the Italian edition of `` The Satanic Verses,'' but <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s French publishers, <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourgois </PERSON>, suspended publication plans. _ The <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, backing earlier protests by British writers, denounced the threats against <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> and his publishers as contrary to the `` tolerance and understanding that are the hallmark of a free society.''

 A Japanese balloonist was drifting more slowly than planned early Friday because of a shifting jet stream that could whisk him toward <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> instead of his planned destination of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a spokesman said. Three days after he set off to become the first solo balloonist to cross the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fumio </PERSON> <PERSON> Niwa </PERSON> floated east near <LOCATION> Torishima </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, about 1,250 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, at 9:30 a.m., said spokesman <PERSON> Naoto </PERSON> <PERSON> Higashi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Niwa </PERSON> was floating in his orange-and-blue helium balloon over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> at about 35 mph at the south edge of a jet stream, slower than he had hoped, <PERSON> Higashi </PERSON> said. Another spokesman, <PERSON> Hiroaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON>, said the jet stream can carry him at about 125 mph, but <PERSON> Niwa </PERSON> decided not to enter it fully because it was angling toward <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Originally, <PERSON> Niwa </PERSON> had planned to rise immediately to 26,400 feet and enter the jet stream, which he calculated would have blown him the 5,000-mile distance to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> in four days. <PERSON> Niwa </PERSON> rose to 23,100 feet on Friday, from 15,100 feet on Thursday night, <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON> said. Despite delays due to slight changes in the angle of the jet stream, <PERSON> Higashi </PERSON> said <PERSON> Niwa </PERSON> still expected to reach his target by about Feb. 20. <PERSON> Niwa </PERSON> has supplies for 10 days. The 38-year-old balloonist lifted off from <LOCATION> Yokohama </LOCATION>, southwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, early Wednesday in a spherical plastic gondola six feet wide that he had designed himself. The capsule is pressurized but has no navigational or heating equipment. <PERSON> Niwa </PERSON> relies on amateur radio reports based on radio beacon signals to pinpoint his location. The temperature inside the gondola Friday morning was 23 degrees, and it was minus 13 outside, said <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON>. Battery-powered electric coils in <PERSON> Niwa </PERSON>'s flight suit keep him warm. <PERSON> Niwa </PERSON> quit his job with a computer firm three months ago to prepare for the flight. He said he planned to sleep during the day and stay awake at night. In 1981, four men reached the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> by balloon for the first time, but no one has traveled the distance alone. <PERSON> Niwa </PERSON>, who has 1,000 hours of ballooning experience, estimated the flight would cost about $ 540,000, which he hopes to regain through a book and lectures about his experience.

 Contra rebels will not lay down their weapons until <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government institutes the democratic reforms it pledged at the Central American summit, a rebel leader said Thursday. <PERSON> Wilfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Montalvan </PERSON>, a director of the Contra organization known as the Nicaraguan Resistance, told a news conference in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> the rebels will wait four months to see if the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> carry out the election reforms they promised. Otherwise, he said, they will renew their war against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and `` we will seek military aid to do it, and we will ask for it anywhere we can,'' <PERSON> Montalvan </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supported the Contras with weapons and training for six years until February 1988, when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> banned the aid. In <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, Sandinista officials said the Contras killed five people in attacks this week, including a Sandinista army lieutenant. The government said the lieutenant, a woman and two boys were killed in a machine-gun attack Wednesday on a home in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guasimon </LOCATION>, 120 miles northeast of the capital, <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. Rebels also killed a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> minister during attacks in northeast <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> on Wednesday night, Sandinista officials said. At the end of a two-day regional summit in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> on Tuesday, President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> announced that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> will hold early elections, permit the opposition to campaign and allow observers from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to watch the polling. The presidents of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> announced they would devise a plan within 90 days to dismantle the rebel force, especially Contra supply and training camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> along the Nicaraguan border. At the summit, it was clear from comments by <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> aides that <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> expects the Contras will be disbanded before the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have to undertake any of their promised reforms. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said the reforms would begin several months before the February 1990 elections. <PERSON> Montalvan </PERSON> said he was `` satisfied'' with <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s announcement advancing the election date by 10 months to February 1990, but he said the Nicaraguan Resistance will be watching to see what concrete reforms the Sandinistas undertake before disarming. `` We will not surrender a single rifle unless there is total democracy in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` We are willing to surrender our weapons, but only in exchange for democracy. We are lovers of peace, and if we are in rebellion it's because they have denied us freedom and human rights.'' <PERSON> Montalvan </PERSON> said the Sandinistas should undertake the election reforms `` immediately in order to generate confidence in the peace process,'' under a plan devised by Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> in 1987 for which he was awarded that year's Nobel Peace Prize. The plan, and accompanying peace accords the five presidents signed in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> at the time, sought a negotiated end to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contra war, a nine-year leftist guerrilla war in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and a decades-old leftist insurrection in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. After a flurry of talks between rebels and government representatives in the three countries, only the Contras and <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> achieved a frail cease-fire last April. There has been no agreement on peace, mostly because of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>' insistence that the rebels surrender before political reforms are undertaken.

 Two apparently unrelated deaths of Korean citizens near a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air base in the provincial city of <LOCATION> Kusan </LOCATION> led to violent anti-American protests, police and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Friday. Radical students demanding punishment for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen involved in the deaths held rallies and clashed with riot police this week, witnesses said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and South Korean authorities are investigating the two deaths in <LOCATION> Kunsan </LOCATION>, a port city about 130 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the incidents were apparently unrelated. They said all military personnel at <LOCATION> Kunsan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> now were restricted to the base. The first death was that of a mushroom grower identified as <PERSON> Chong </PERSON> <PERSON> Pan-yong </PERSON>, 54, who died Saturday after an altercation in a residential area of the city. Tech. Sgt. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harayda </PERSON>, 29, of <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, stationed at <ORGANIZATION> Osan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> with the 51st Tactical Fighter Wing, was released in that case in the custody of <LOCATION> Kunsan </LOCATION> Air Base authorities, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. He was visiting <LOCATION> Kunsan </LOCATION> at the time on the incident. On Wednesday, a military vehicle driven by Spec. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. Green of the <ORGANIZATION> 501st </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Signal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> struck and killed Song Yun-jae, 36. Green is based at <LOCATION> Kunsan </LOCATION>. Pvt. <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrell </PERSON>, also of the 501st, was a passenger in the vehicle at the time. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the accident occurred on a city street near a local university. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military authorities are holding the two soldiers until investigations are completed, officials said. Their hometowns were not available. Student sources, reached by telephone in <LOCATION> Kunsan </LOCATION>, said about 500 students yelling anti-American slogans held a rally Wednesday and clashed with police in downtown streets for almost three hours until they were dispersed by tear gas. The sources said on condition of anonymity that a rally also was held Thursday to demand South Korean police punish the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers involved in the two deaths and that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> pay compensation to the families. Also Thursday, up to 300 radical students screaming `` Oppose <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit!'' attacked a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cultural center in downtown <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> with firebombs and steel pipes, and at least six policemen were hurt, officials said. <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> lies 180 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, the capital. The cultural center is favorite target of radicals, who have attacked it 28 times since 1980. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is to stop over in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on Feb. 27 on his way home after attending Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s funeral in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and visiting <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> said some furniture and fixtures suffered fire damage in the attack.

 New allegations of `` troublesome'' indiscretions by Defense Secretary-designate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> arose Thursday, and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman raised the possibility that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> may hold a rare closed session to grapple with questions about Tower's personal life. Former arms control chief <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adelman </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>'s personal conduct when he served as a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> created problems for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> He said Tower's actions, which he declined to specify, raised questions about his judgment and integrity. Meantime, the latest <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report into Tower's background has not uncovered any evidence linking him to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> weapons-buying scandal or illegal campaign contributions, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Friday editions. But the newspaper, quoting unnamed sources, said the report contains new details about Tower's personal life. The volume of information about his drinking habits and relations with women is so great he probably would n't be hired as an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent, the newspaper said. The report will be sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, the newspaper said. From January 1985 to April 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> headed the department's delegation that discussed mutual cuts in long-range nuclear missiles with the Soviets Tower's private behavior did n't directly affect his conduct of official business at the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks, <PERSON> Adelman </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the armed services panel, has said an investigation of Tower's actions in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> found no security breaches But <PERSON> Adelman </PERSON> said Tower's conduct should be a factor in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation deliberations because `` a <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary has no private life.'' <PERSON> Adelman </PERSON> spoke in an <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> interview published Thursday and in a <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> column on Wednesday. <PERSON> Adelman </PERSON> said he was impressed with Tower's performance as a strategic arms negotiator, `` Yet his lack of discretion proved troublesome then, as before and since.'' Tower has been dogged by allegations of drinking and womanizing, and many senators also have voiced concern whether Tower could avoid conflicts of interest after receiving more than $ 1 million as a consultant for major defense contractors since he left the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> four years ago. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, at a <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> appearance Thursday, said he hopes his committee can vote on Tower's nomination next week. He said the `` delay now is waiting on the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to check out an allegation that came from the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is known to be investigating new allegations that <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> has said are of a financial nature. Other senators have said they are related to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s massive contract fraud case. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said that if the committee were to vote today, `` I think most people on the committee have n't decided because we have not got all the information.'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said that if questions arise from members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> regarding Tower's personal life, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> may be forced to meet behind closed doors. `` I hope not, but it depends on the type of questions posed on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor by senators who are not members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> told reporters Wednesday during a visit to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION> `` If an accurate answer to these questions include personal information, I would recommend that a limited closed session be held to answer these questions and only these questions,'' he said. `` I emphasize that the leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will make this decision, not the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> or its chairman.'' Meanwhile, a prominent Republican senators said he doubted that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will confirm <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nominee. Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, R-Minn., said Tower's past associations with defense contractors would cast a shadow over his decision-making at the Pentagon `` I think he'd be haunted by that, every decision he'd try to make, which does n't make him a bad defense secretary, because he probably is the kind of tough guy we need,'' <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. But Sen. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON>, R-Minn., said he expects Tower to win <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval and added: `` He's a tough little dog, I tell you, and he's going to get into that <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and he's going to think that his reputation needs a lot of repair, and it does, and I think he's going to do some pretty good work He's going to shake those folks up and they need to be shaken up in the department.,'' Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, D-Ark., in an appearance at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, said Tower has `` really become his own worst enemy'' and predicted that he will not be `` The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> has enough problems today without the secretary of defense bringing in his own problems,'' <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> has said he will reserve judgment on the Tower nomination until the committee receives the final <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report, expected sometime next week. A committee vote is possible next week when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> returns from its recess. A closed session of the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is highly unusual, occurring on average about once a year and usually relating to national security issues. The last closed session occurred on March 29, 1988, when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> met to discuss the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> held a closed session during the impeachment proceedings of Judge <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON>. Closed sessions were held in 1984 on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, in 1983 on two <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> nominations and in 1982 on U.S.-Soviet defense issues. In 1980, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> met behind closed doors on military readiness.

 Americans are increasingly going to nursing homes to die as hospitals discharge terminally ill patients to keep them from running up big bills, thus helping reduce the nation's <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> costs, according to two reports today. One study, based on nationwide death statistics, suggests that the trend results largely from new Medicare rules that pay hospitals flat fees for taking care of the elderly. This approach gives them a financial incentive to keep patients' hospital stays as short as possible. `` What has to be said is that hospitals are in a bind because they are being pressured by cost cutting,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sager </PERSON>, who directed the study. `` Nursing homes are in a bind because nobody wants to pay for nursing home care. Patients are in a bind because they are in a system that does not want to provide continuity of care and health care financing is fragmented.'' His research showed that the number of elderly Americans dying in nursing homes rose sharply during the 1980s, while fewer died in hospitals.

<TEXT>
 Those ubiquitous `` economic observers'' whose views are cited so often do n't know whether to cheer or worry these days. The economy has become that confusing. The reason: economic growth, normally the most sought-after goal of policy-makers, has become a cause of concern. Too much growth is bad. You can take <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s word for it. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, has stated and restated his view that the six-year-old expansion is headed toward inflation _ which often precede recessions _ unless growth is harnessed. In a nutshell, his rationale is contained in a statement made last summer to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, to wit: `` Considering the already limited slack in available labor and capital resources, a leveling of the unemployment and capacity utilization rates is essential if more intense inflationary pressures are to be avoided in the period ahead.'' Ever since, he has been putting upward pressure on interest rates, the better to slow growth. It creates a perplexing situation for ordinary folks to understand. There are even hints from time to time that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may be among the perplexed. More than once the president has stated that he and <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> are n't far apart in their approaches to the economy. But then the president has stated that he is n't nearly as concerned about inflation as <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> is. At most times, 4 percent economic growth would be reason to cheer. So would a sharp decline in unemployment, a rise in the rate at which the nation's factories are utilized, higher retail sales, consumer confidence _ and more. To some extent, these and other factors are still described as evidences of health, strength and vigor. But the descriptions are barely uttered when the caveats follow. Typical: `` Of course, the threat of inflation. ...'' For most Americans it is difficult to believe that growth is bad, since economic growth has been a continuing theme of the country's history Moreover, is n't growth needed in order for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to meet foreign competition? Yes. But <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> and like-thinkers say a nation's capacity to produce is limited by the manpower, money and machines at its disposal. As they see it, we are now straining all three resources. When that happens the economy begins to smoke. It becomes stressed, less productive, because it must rely on less efficient manpower and plants. Rather than producing goods and services, the economy manufactures higher prices. Not everyone agrees with the slow-growth theme, and notable among them is <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON>, economics director at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON> is so outspoken that a year from now he will be either hero or bum. `` We think growth is good,'' he stated in a recent newsletter. `` We believe -LRB- <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> -RRB- is exaggerating the inflationary risks.'' Moreover, <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON> contends, much of recent economic activity has been in the expansion of capital goods, which expand domestic capacity and boost exports. To <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON>, this is a critical consideration. He explains: `` If Mr. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> turns the screws too tight, he could snuff out the capital spending boom we need to expand the capacity that he fears there is n't enough of.'' Of course, <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON> says, it is true that tight monetary policy can increase slack by depressing economic demand. But his approach is the opposite: `` We prefer policies that create slack by letting capacity grow.'' Ah, there's the problem to which the answer is so elusive. Is growth good or bad? Do we slow down or do we speed up? Do we cheer or do we worry?

<HEAD>`Passion and Paradise' Lacks Both</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Well, we're all just so pleased that the cast and crew of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Passion and Paradise'' got to do part of the winter filming in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>. That seems to be the best result of this two-part movie, no doubt named `` Passion and Paradise'' because such a title will draw more viewers than the more apt `` Tedium and Purgatory.'' Was it only a week ago that we were hailing the triumph of quality in `` Lonesome Dove?'' Back to reality, folks. This is a mostly muddled attempt to make a suspense yarn out of the real-life 1943 murder of Sir <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON>, a fabulously wealthy American miner who traded gold for British title and a plantation in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON>' murder was never solved, though it likely was linked to his opposition to legalized gambling on the islands, a development sorely desired by organized crime. The movie, which airs Sunday and Tuesday, sports a rather bizarre cast. Yes, <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mariette </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON> _ together at last! <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON> are actually not bad as <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON> and his wife, saddled as they are with a lurching script that provides ample opportunity for great fits of overacting. <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON>, playing the doomed Sir <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>, manages to last through the first installment. In the second, <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON> shrieks at one point, `` Kill me! Kill me now!'' This seems to be part of the dialogue and not a spontaneous plea to be released from the proceedings. <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Assante </PERSON>, looking like <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> in exile, seems to be making a career out of slouching through overwrought network miniseries. He plays <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Marigny </PERSON>, a count-slash-chicken-farmer who casts aside his history of fortune-hunting to woo and win Sir <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>'s winsome _ and very rich _ daughter, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>. She is played with fretful consternation by <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, whose reaction to tragedy seems remarkably similar to observing a run in one's stocking When <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> discovers that <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> has a wife, she complains, `` Do you know what this makes me feel like?'' A new agent, perhaps? <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON> is bludgeoned and burned in what appeared to be a voodoo ceremony _ there was an uprising among native workers at the time. The rest of the movie is taken up with <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON>'s mind-numbing murder trial, interspersed with scenes that attempt to portray everyone else as still a suspect. This is the writing-directing equivalent of trying to keep several plates spinning at one time. But mystery turns to melodrama. The villains _ Mafia stereotypes partnered with snooty Britons _ have all the subtly of a herd of Snidely Whiplashes. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarrazin </PERSON> does, however, do an admirably oily job of playing the gangsters' evil emissary to the islands. It seems the gangsters are in cahoots with the <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> and Duchess of <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION> -LRB- <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> and <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON> -RRB-, a dastardly and enormously amusing pair. The duke was governor of the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> during World War II. `` I want that casino,'' the duchess pouts to the duke. `` If I ca n't be queen of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, I'll make my own kingdom here.'' `` Why ca n't it be like the old days between us?'' he whines. `` It can be,'' she purrs. `` You'll think of something, wo n't you? and plants a wet one on him in case he does n't get the picture. Late in the movie _ if you last this long, please consult a physician _ there's an entirely new twist when <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> arrives impersonating Columbo, or in this case cheerfully frumpy private eye <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Schindler </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> has brought from the <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to help prove <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON>'s innocence. Since we know the case was never solved, we know the outcome of the trial. But that's not the end of the movie. <PERSON> Schindler </PERSON> ensconces himself on a sofa to propound his own cockamamie theory about what really happened to <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON>. In a surprise ending it turns out there was really no reason to make a movie about the whole messy business at all.

<HEAD>Too Little Capacity Might Become Too Much</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A very tricky matter is developing for monetary officials, meaning those who have an input into <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> money policies, and it will take luck as well as wisdom to deal with it. It is odd as well as tricky: The potential solution is part of the problem. It means that in order to deal with the problem, officials might be forced to delay the solution. The problem involves an inflation threat. The hard fact is that the economy is approaching the limits of its capacity. When that point is reached, prices might rise sharply. Demand will exceed the ability to produce. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> announced this week that in December and January the operating rate of industry was 84.4 percent, figures that have not been surpassed since October 1979. In the past, figures higher than that led to rising prices. One way to deal with such a problem is to slow the economy, thus keeping demand within capacity. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has been trying to do that, pressuring interest rates higher almost month by month since last summer. Based on experience, high interest rates eventually will produce the slack that is sought by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>. But it might do something more: It might very well force industry to forgo efforts to expand its capacity to meet the demand. Capacity is expanded in several ways _ by building new plants, expanding manufacturing space, adding more efficient equipment and instituting various other procedures that permit greater efficiencies. That process is now going full blast, but a serious question arises: Will rising interest rates snuff it out? Evidence of the capital outlays boom are contained in a just-released analysis from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION>, which surveys its membership every three months on a variety of economic matters. The latest survey shows that plans for capital outlays jumped to 36 percent of all the federation's 500,000 business members, the highest percentage since questions on the subject became part of the survey in 1977. Economist <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>, who designed the study and interprets results every quarter, said the findings suggest `` the underlying strength of capital spending in the economy is still not reflected in official statistics.'' The study found that 57 percent of the companies _ made up of enterprises ranging in size from proprietorships to those with sales in the hundreds of millions of dollars _ have made capital outlays in the past six months. He observes that major additions to production capacity are being made in a broad range of industries, that major electricity generating plans are in the pipeline, and that business construction of all types remains strong. In short, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry is making a massive attempt to enlarge capacity to meet the stress of demand. Can it succeed, or will it take too long to build enough capacity before inflation gets out of hand? More importantly, can industry continue to build capacity if interest rates continue to rise? While nobody, not even profound <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> minds, can answer with any certainty, a bit of encouragement is contained in the <ORGANIZATION> NFIB </ORGANIZATION> report. It shows that with profits strong, many companies are able to finance internally. If the economy slows, however, and especially if it dips into recession, those profits might not be sufficient to the task. <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON> says costly money already is discouraging some borrowing. And, he says, since 48 percent of member short-term loans are tied to the prime rate, many companies are `` exposed'' to any slowdown attempts by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>The Bard's The Thing On The British Stage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Bard's the thing on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stage these days, with a stream of productions to compete with the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> and a renewed confidence in <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s selling power <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> has been the obvious mainstay of the government-subsidized <ORGANIZATION> RSC </ORGANIZATION> since it was founded by Sir <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> in 1960. In 1989-90, the Company will mount more <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> than ever _ 14 out of a total of 27 productions. But what has changed is the amount of Shakespeare available elsewhere. Last season, the newly formed <ORGANIZATION> Renaissance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> mounted a sell-out 10-week run of three <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> plays at the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> End </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Theater </LOCATION>, winning plaudits for actor-manager <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Branagh </PERSON>'s vivacity plus a new audience for the Bard The <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> is now playing host to <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobi </PERSON> _ who directed the Renaissance production of `` Hamlet'' _ in the title roles of both `` <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> II'' and `` <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> and <PERSON> Felicity </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendal </PERSON> open early in April in a West End staging of `` Much Ado About Nothing'' in repertory with <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chekhov </PERSON>'s `` Ivanov.'' <PERSON> Dustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> follows in June, making his <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stage debut as Shylock in `` The Merchant of <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>.'' In the fall, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gambon </PERSON> who starred in TV's `` Singing Detective,'' will play Othello, with playwright <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON> directing. And the English <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> is staging a seven-play cycle of history plays at the Old <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> under the collective title `` The Wars of the Roses.'' `` The Shakespeare boom continues, and is challenging the <ORGANIZATION> RSC </ORGANIZATION>'s historic leadership,'' wrote <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratcliffe </PERSON> in The Observer in an article headlined `` Will-power shakes up the scene. This theatrical landscape recalls the pre-subsidy 1940s and'50s, when acting greats such as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gielgud </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON> regularly performed the Bard on the West End. On Broadway, by contrast, <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> works are rare, and only two productions in the past decade have made money: the <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones-Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Plummer </PERSON> `` Othello''; and the <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobi </PERSON> `` Much Ado About Nothing,'' an RSC import. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, who is associated in the theater with the modern plays of <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, calls the return to classics `` very healthy. It is also very brave, but there does seem to be an audience for it.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Pennington </PERSON>, the 48-year-old actor heading `` The Wars of the Roses'' cycle, said he finds the trend very heartening. A former RSC regular, <PERSON> Pennington </PERSON> and director <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogdanov </PERSON> started their company in November 1986 to reinvigorate the Bard's plays outside the institutional confines of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s large subsidized companies <PERSON> Pennington </PERSON> took the <ORGANIZATION> English </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and returned to find that the company's `` <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'' is one of three on view in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> this season. His fears the British might be glutted on <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> have proved unfounded. `` We were concerned the audience was going to be split because a small minority go to <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>, let alone unpopular <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Pennington </PERSON>, referring particularly to the rarely performed `` <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> VI </PERSON>'' history plays, a trilogy which the <ORGANIZATION> ESC </ORGANIZATION> has compressed into two plays. Instead, he said, `` we may have provoked something. <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> is good box office.'' The RSC is staging much of the same cycle this season under the title `` The Plantagenets,'' which conflates the three `` <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> VI </PERSON>'' plays and `` <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'' into a nine-hour marathon event opening April 1. `` There's obviously an energy abroad which is thrilling,'' said <ORGANIZATION> RSC </ORGANIZATION> associate director <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> Noble </PERSON>. `` The proof is in the pudding: I have a feeling the experience each one offers is so different.'' He thinks the rekindled interest in Shakespeare may be a reaction to contemporary political drama, which is often shrill and constricted where <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> is full of scope for new interpretation. Noble directed the RSC in a highly praised 1984 production of `` <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> V </PERSON>,'' turning it into an anti-war statement against <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s war with <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> over the <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> two years earlier `` The strong didactic viewpoint of the'60s and'70s is a thing of the past,'' he said. `` There's actually a very strong thirst for non-editorialized political drama: Our lives are full of contradiction, and these are complex, contradictory plays.'' The RSC survives on its subsidy, and the <ORGANIZATION> ESC </ORGANIZATION> on sponsorship by <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. But both the <PERSON> Jacobi </PERSON> double-bill and the <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> `` Much Ado'' are straightforward commercial ventures of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Triumph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION> They are being presented in a financial climate that favors smaller casts and less elaborate scenery. `` It's like a small-scale musical with attendant costs,'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON>, Triumph's deputy managing director, said of the two `` Richard'' plays, which are expected to go to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and Broadway next year. While refusing to give exact figures, <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON> said costs ran three times as high as, say, the two-character `` A Walk in the Woods'' with <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Guinness </PERSON>, a Triumph production whose 150,000-pound -LRB- $ 260,000 -RRB- budget roughly equals the average <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> budget for a straight play. But he said <PERSON> Jacobi </PERSON>'s presence made the risks worthwhile. `` When you have a star like <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> who has assumed the mantle of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gielgud </PERSON>, that justifies it.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Isabella </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossellini </PERSON>'s film career has included mostly off-beat movies, notably <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>'s underground classic, `` Blue Velvet,'' <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mailer </PERSON>'s `` Tough Guys Do n't Dance'' and the sleeper hit, `` Siesta.'' But in `` Cousins,'' the American remake of the popular French film, `` Cousin, <LOCATION> Cousine </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Rossellini </PERSON> plays a woman torn between the love of two men, the kind of part that was a specialty of her mother, <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>. Fans of `` Casablanca,'' who agonized over whether <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> would end up with <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON>, the man she loved, or her husband, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Henreid </PERSON>, to whom she felt responsible, can see <PERSON> Rossellini </PERSON> forced to make a similar decision in `` Cousins.'' `` I do what I like,'' the actress said in a recent interview. `` If a commercial film comes about that I like, I love to do it. I have a different reason why I want to do each film.'' She plays <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>, who ends up falling in love with <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozinski </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Danson </PERSON> -RRB- after her husband -LRB- <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> -RRB- has an affair with <PERSON> Kozinski </PERSON>'s wife -LRB- <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> -RRB-. <PERSON> Rossellini </PERSON>'s participation in the film, which also stars <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bridges </ORGANIZATION> and the Argentine actress, <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Aleandro </PERSON>, came about by accident. She had originally been asked to look at the script as a favor to friends who were putting the film together. `` There was a kind of a warmth and nice feeling to it,'' she said. `` I was a little bit bashful. I did n't know what I was going to do. I told them I read the script and I really like it. But I would like to do it.'' The cast of `` Cousins'' comes from a wide range of backgrounds. <PERSON> Danson </PERSON> had starred in the hit TV sit-com `` Cheers.'' <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> worked in the theater. Young pursued a dancing career before making her film debut at age 19. <PERSON> Aleandro </PERSON> had appeared on stage, screen and television and had won acclaim and honors for her part in `` The Official Story.'' <PERSON> Rossellini </PERSON> brought her experience as a model and journalist. `` The ability to keep in character is the same thing that happens when you model _ not being thrown off and getting nervous and tense about having a lot of people around you.'' Modeling also helped <PERSON> Rossellini </PERSON> become sensitive to the importance of wardrobe. `` The way you dress shows a little the way your character is. I love talking with the designers about my character. I think I am trained to see the different ways people dress.'' <PERSON> Rossellini </PERSON> and her twin sister, <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON>, were born in 1952, the children of <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> and Italian director <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossellini </PERSON>, whose affair in the late 1940s shocked the film world and led to <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>'s estrangement from <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> for many years With her mother one of the world's most famous actresses and her father a major director, <PERSON> Rossellini </PERSON> was reluctant to get involved in filmmaking. `` I guess I never dared. I thought it was kind of presumptous,'' said <PERSON> Rossellini </PERSON>, who has been married twice, to director <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorcese </PERSON> and model <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiedemann </PERSON>. `` My father wanted me to finish school. They always felt being an actress would be difficult and they were right!'' So at age 20 she worked as a translator for Italian television and eventually spent three years conducting interviews for the Italian comedy series, `` The Other Sunday.'' `` That was rewarding. The fact that I was able to become successful made me more secure about myself and helped me become an actress. I think if I would have started at 18, I would have been devastated. I was little more together when I started at 30-31,'' she said. Her modeling career started in 1980 when she agreed to have her picture taken by photographer <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> and ended up on the cover of <ORGANIZATION> Vogue </ORGANIZATION> magazine. She appeared in a few minor films, `` The Meadow'' and `` Il Papocchio,'' and became popular with American audiences in 1984 playing <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Hines </PERSON>' Russian-born wife in `` White Nights.'' But <PERSON> Rossellini </PERSON> was n't adverse to stepping out of the mainstream. In 1986, she played <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON>'s abused wife in `` Blue Velvet,'' one of the strangest and most critically acclaimed films of the year. `` It was very original, very rich,'' she said. `` I had imagined it like this. It was all in the script. The atmosphere on the set was very warm and very friendly. People think it must have been very unpleasant to play it, but the atmosphere was just the opposite. I do n't think I could have played the scenes otherwise.'' What also mattered to <PERSON> Rossellini </PERSON> was the ability to relate to her character. `` It's essential. How do you portray someone you do n't like? Even when I read a script, I kind of have to fall in love with my character. Love is the basis of an inspiration, of creativity. You spend hours and hours trying to figure it out. If there is n't love, nothing comes to your mind.''

 The Rev. <PERSON> Kan </PERSON> <PERSON> Xueqing </PERSON> says his prayers have been answered. One of his flock, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, has been elected president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` God has his own plan,'' said <PERSON> Kan </PERSON>, as he sat smiling in an antechamber of his church in a bustling section of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` He arranges things in wondrous ways.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s former tennis coach <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Huailong </PERSON> says he'd love to get a game in with the president when he comes to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Feb. 25-27, after the funeral of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, but his old tennis partner will probably be too busy. `` I'd like to see whether his backhand has improved,'' said <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, wearing a Japanese track suit at <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. `` He never beat me in singles so I'd like to give him another shot.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> lived in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> from September 1974 to October 1975 when he headed the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liaison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> set up in the early days of U.S.-Chinese rapprochement that resulted in full diplomatic relations in 1979. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> became chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after leaving <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> considers <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> an `` old friend,'' an important moniker in this land where the distinction between friends and enemy is clear. The government openly rooted for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to win the presidency and Chinese leaders were pleased when he was elected. But when the Bushes lived here, <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> was a forbidding place for foreigners. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was still in the throes of the ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution. Chinese were not allowed to talk to foreigners and were often questioned by police if they did. To cut some of the isolation, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife often left their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government car at home and rode `` Forever'' brand Chinese bicycles. They went to Sunday church services for foreigners. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> played tennis daily at the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> while Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> dabbled in Tai Ch' i, a Chinese breathing exercise. Mostly they fraternized with other foreigners because of the conditions at the time. `` In 1975, hardly anyone Chinese outside of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> would speak to us,'' said a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat, who served in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in the 1970s. `` We were pariah, dangerous. So we made do with ourselves.'' Coach <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> was one of the few Chinese <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> saw almost every day. `` He'd ride down here on his bicycle. Tennis balls in one basket, and soda pop and ice in another,'' said <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>. `` I was always glad to play him because that meant I could share his cold drinks.'' <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was a pretty good player in doubles but was a little weak in singles. `` I remember when he would win a point with a good shot, he'd always fall to his knees and stick his arms in the air,'' said <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, laughing `` He was a pretty jolly fellow.'' <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> was n't the only one impressed by the Bushes' bicycles. `` The moment I saw the Bushes riding toward our little church I knew there was something special about them,'' said Kan. `` They did n't put on snobbish, diplomatic airs.'' <PERSON> Kan </PERSON> and his colleague, the Rev. <PERSON> Shi </PERSON> <PERSON> Zesheng </PERSON>, met the Bushes regularly. At the request of the diplomatic community, the pair, who had been forced to work in the countryside during the early part of the Cultural Revolution, began Christian church services for foreigners only. The services took place in the old <ORGANIZATION> Bible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shi </PERSON> were not allowed to preach but <PERSON> Kan </PERSON> led hymns and <PERSON> Shi </PERSON> accompanied on the piano. `` I remember one winter day very clearly,'' said Kan. `` Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was late. Instead of hanging up his big blue cotton coat, he rolled it up and stuffed it under his chair. I remember thinking, ` He really is a regular guy.''' Another day stands out in <PERSON> Shi </PERSON>'s mind _ `` the day we baptized Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s daughter.'' It was Aug. 8, 1975, the 16th birthday of <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, now <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBlond </PERSON>. `` He wanted to give her a special present,'' <PERSON> Shi </PERSON> said. `` So we talked with our superiors and they agreed to let us baptize her.'' <PERSON> Shi </PERSON> presented the family with a baptismal certificate, done in his own calligraphy. <PERSON> Kan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shi </PERSON> said they too supported <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential candidacy. `` I still pray for him,'' said <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION> `` I have requested God to watch over him, this good friend of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.''

 Crescendoing costs and tapering revenue are forcing many of the nation's major orchestras to bow to financial pressure by playing more crowd-pleasing music and jazzing up their image to lure new fans. `` We've been doing the same concerts for 200 years now. It's a fixed animal. It has n't changed. Not even the dress has changed,'' said <PERSON> Gideon </PERSON> <PERSON> Toeplitz </PERSON>, managing director of the <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION>. `` But what has changed is what attracts the audiences.'' `` You have to make it an exciting event, no matter what it takes,'' agreed <PERSON> Joanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're competing for the same leisure dollar that goes to the movies on Saturday night.'' The problem, once pianissimo, is now fortissimo: _ In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, symphony concerts are scheduled to resume March 8 after more than a year of silence due to a local recession that crippled orchestral funding. The comeback is due to a debt reduction plan that includes the sale of the Orpheum Theater, the orchestra's home _ In <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, the symphony has emerged from bankruptcy and is back in operation following a seven-month moratorium, thanks to contributions from corporatio `` We get a lot of one-time people, a lot of quick come-and-go,'' <PERSON> Toeplitz </PERSON> said. `` What we need to do, in the long run, is build commitments.''

 The next time producers of the Grammy awards want to pay tribute to the music industry's past, they may have to consider the long-playing record. With LP sales falling drastically and the compact disc's popularity soaring, the future of vinyl seems, at best, limited. `` It's getting close,'' says <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugster </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Musicland </ORGANIZATION> chain, whose 685 stores nationwide include <ORGANIZATION> Musicland </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Goody </PERSON>. `` I do n't think anyone wants to say goodbye, but it's certainly not going to be a category that anybody is going to be stocking in any depth. Figures released by the <ORGANIZATION> Recording </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> show that in 1985 the CD sold 22.6 million units nationwide compared to 167 million for the LP. But by 1987, the CD had pulled virtually even, selling 102.1 million units while LP sales dropped to 107 million. Figures available for the first half of 1988 show an even more drastic shift with records moving just 43.5 million units and CDs selling 70.4 million. While record stores are busy returning unsold LPs, U2's `` The <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Tree </PERSON>'' recently became the first CD to be certified platinum for selling a million copies. The `` Dirty Dancing'' soundtrack, <PERSON> Def </PERSON> <PERSON> Leppard </PERSON>'s `` Hysteria,'' and `` Faith'' by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> have all followed suit. But as major labels and record stores follow the market, others insist that LPs sound better than CDs and should not be phased out. LPs generally sell for about $ 8.98 and CDs are in the $ 10 - $ 20 range CDs are digitally mastered -LRB- as opposed to analog for LP -RRB-, a concept first tested in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in the 1920s. Digital recorders sample sound waves at a rate of a little over 44,000 times a second and put them back together, resulting in a `` clean'' but sometimes hollow sound. The effect could be compared to watching a film, which consists of a series of still frames run at a high enough speed to give the appearance of a moving picture. Analog recordings pick up everything that's sent out, increasing the chance for hiss and distortion but also producing a fuller sound. The necessary equipment for digital was not available, however, until the'60s when <ORGANIZATION> NHK </ORGANIZATION>, the Japanese public televison station, worked with <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Denon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to develop prototype recorders. Digital recordings -LRB- also known as <ORGANIZATION> PCM </ORGANIZATION>, or Pulse Code Modulation -RRB- were first demonstrated in the late'60s and became available to the general public in 1972 when <PERSON> Denon </PERSON> released the <ORGANIZATION> Mozart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hunting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suite </ORGANIZATION> by the Smetana Quartet. <ORGANIZATION> PCM </ORGANIZATION> recordings were only available on vinyl and cassette until the'80s when they were issued in the form of a 5-inch `` compact disc'' developed by <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, and they quickly became the hottest audio item of the decade. `` Analog recordings are subject to the environment and get destroyed. There are old recordings of <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> that are gone,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Heiblim </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Denon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, which produces both digital and analog recordings. `` With CDs we can just keep making copies so we have it forever. `` What the engineer hears in the recording studio the consumer does not hear on analog. Sometimes they get less than one-fifth the sound quality. The digital allows you to hear what the engineer hears. Also each analog recording we stamp out sounds slightly less good than the first. In compact disc or digital recordings, the millionth copy is the same as the first copy.'' But some authorities disagree. `` With the compact disc, you're listening to a musical event without the sense of being there,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Archibald </PERSON> of Stereo File magazine. `` The second thing is that high frequencies in analog are more easily and graciously produced than in digital and the third thing has to do with general low-level information _ subtle clues about the recording site and where the recording was made; little details in the sound of instruments. Digital tends to lose this.'' <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>, publisher of The Absolute Sound, also prefers analog recordings. `` You've got to consider that analog technology is 100 years old and it's been refined and perfected,'' he said. `` This is the first generation of digital technology. It's going to take a long time for digital to sound as good as analog. Analogue retrieves more information because digital can not reproduce a wide band signal.'' CDs are not immune to damage. Though no wear occurs during play since they are grooveless and operated by a beam of light, they can still be scatched and dirt stains or smudges can cause mistracking. Extreme temperatures also can damage CDs. <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, the senior vice president of sales at <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>. Records, is n't taking sides He's letting the sales figures speak for themselves. `` We're not trying to form people's opinion, we're reacting to the market. Our job is to make available what people want to buy,'' he said. `` If the market buys something, it will be available. If I ship 1,000 LPs and take back 582, the market has told me they're not interested.'' Because LPs are selling so poorly, four of the six major record companies -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elektra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asylum </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> EMI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> Angel; and CBS -RRB- have increased their penalties from 5 to 10 percent for records returned. For example, a <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Goody </PERSON> store might order 1,000 LPs of the new <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> album but only be able to sell 500. The remaining copies could be returned to the record company but the store would be penalized. `` It's a real challenge to stay in stock. It puts pressure on you to do very well. There are certain titles that are not brought out in LP, that's an increasing percent,'' <PERSON> Eugster </PERSON> said. Since the major labels are unlikely to put their entire catalog on CD, analog proponents are worried that some records will become difficult to find. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingernari </PERSON>, co-owner of <ORGANIZATION> Footlight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> store that buys and sells used LPs, says business has expanded greatly. `` So much of what we have is just not available on CD,'' he said. `` Some of the most expensive records are the ones that were the dogs. They've become very rare and unavailable. We deal with collectors who are still hooked on vinyls.'' One such collector is <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Doris </PERSON>, the technical director of The Absolute Sound. `` Ten years ago, you get could get any of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Zappa </PERSON>'s records, either on Verve or Reprise, for $ 3 to $ 5,'' <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> said. `` Now they're worth $ 15 to $ 50. Also the Grateful Dead, you could find their albums easily 10 years ago, now they're going for $ 20 or $ 30.'' The audio magazines, while conceding that digital recordings are here to stay, have urged the music industry not to turn its back entirely on the LP. But <PERSON> Archibald </PERSON> sees little chance of the industry giving way. `` Unfortunately, I see a future where LPs will only fill a niche market,'' he said. `` Most of the major recording studios are now done in digital. Those recordings will inherently miss some of the great information from analog recordings.''

 The <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> returns to this week is brasher, brighter and better-dressed than it was when he lived here in 1974 and 1975, but it is also a country riven by discontent and searching for a new role in the world. Chinese officials were openly pleased by the election of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president to have lived in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> came as a mining engineer in 1900. `` He understands <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' many said. But <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has undergone vast changes since <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lived here as head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liaison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> that was established in the early days of the U.S.-Chinese reapproachment that culminated with full diplomatic relations in 1979. It has changed much even since he last visited in 1985. As it was before the Communist revolution, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> these days is torn between confidence in its historic greatness, defensiveness about its poverty, envy of richer nations and determination not to simply copy them. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1974 was still in the grip of the Cultural Revolution, a violent, decade-long struggle by radical leftists to create a pure, egalitarian society untouched by foreign or `` bourgeois'' influence. The few thousand foreigners who lived in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, mostly diplomats, were allowed few contacts with Chinese. Giving a foreigner directions on the street could land a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> at the police station for hours of interrogation. Other than government officials, the only Chinese <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had an opportunity for regular contact with were his tennis coach and government-assigned servants. Chairman <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> was rarely seen in public _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> saw him only twice _ but his face and his sayings were omnipresent and he was likened to the sun, sending his revolutionary influence everywhere. Pursuit of individual wealth was an offense against communism, as was wearing high heels, braiding one's hair, dancing or playing any music other than a handful of approved revolutionary songs. About the only dissipation allowed was smoking. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1989 is awash with dissipation. In the cities, women in tight skirts slowdance with men sporting long sideburns at discos that play Western pop music. Small private bars have begun appearing around <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and pool tables line the streets in warm weather. In the countryside, men prosperous from capitalist-style schemes gamble their earnings away, sometimes eliciting the well-publicized ire of local women's groups. Prostitution has returned to some coastal cities, bringing with it veneral disease. Most of the more than 10,000 foreigners who now live in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> still live separately from Chinese, but restrictions on contacts with Chinese are much relaxed. Young men with frizzy perms change currency illegally on the sidewalks, sometimes physically accosting passing foreigners. Except for his portrait hanging at Tiananmen Gate and his body lying in a mausoleum a few hundred yards away, <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> is little seen. The autobiography of American automaker <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iococca </PERSON> is a best seller at the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bookstore </ORGANIZATION>, but the store no longer stocks posters of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>. The Communist Party has acknowledged that <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> made `` serious mistakes'' in launching the Cultural Revolution, and a few daring intellectuals have urged the party to give up its exclusive hold on power. Few Chinese who watched the life-and-death power struggle inside the party during the Cultural Revolution and wanton destruction of property and lives still accept the party's claim to selflessly serve the people. Disillusioned with Marxism and bored with ideologies, many people have refocused on making money and trying to get the most out of the current policy of allowing limited free enterprise. Increased crime and corruption, growing rudeness in daily social exchanges, and increased interest among intellectuals in going abroad to study _ and perhaps stay _ all reflect the new me-firstism. Workers and farmers hungry for a bigger share of the pie have held sporadic strikes. As a nation, too, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is groping for a redefinition of its role. In the early 1970s, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> still believed it was at the vanguard of a world revolution that would free working people from exploitation. Now, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would like to play the role of a world power in settling issues such as the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> conflict, but lacks the economic and military clout. At the same time, it emphasizes its poverty and backwardness in seeking concessionary loans and technological help abroad. Whether or not <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> understands <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is seeking to understand him. His autobiography has been translated into Chinese, and is starting to show up in bookstore windows.

<HEAD>Bush Writes Rules for Budget Talks</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Whatever the game, smart money goes on the side that knows how to take advantage of the rules. So far in the 1989 budget contest, that would be President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s team. In presenting the new budget and in preliminary talks with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on it _ and the old federal deficit _ the administration has set the agenda. That's an advantage in any negotiation. The real bargaining is yet to come, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has the upper hand as it begins. He has presented a basically conservative budget, but one that includes some thrifty proposals for added social program spending at home. That certainly offers no reprise of the <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, even though some Democrats said the Republican budget shifted priorities in their direction. The change from the budget left by <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has more to do with tone and direction than with actual numbers. With no real money to spend on new programs, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> emphasized what would be minimal increases for education, environment, the homeless, child care and other domestic programs. He put compensating spending cuts in the pending file for discussion with congressional Democrats. That's drawn some Democratic complaints that the budget is n't as specific as the law requires, an argument that will go nowhere. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> annually ignores its own budget laws. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> followed his campaign script in recommending a freeze on most federal programs, a freeze in two flavors. He would curb <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending with an inflation-adjusted freeze, allowing dollar increases but no real growth and thus curtailing the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> defense budget, for a year anyhow. He would rein in domestic programs with what the administration calls a `` nominal freeze,'' holding spending to prior amounts without regard to inflation. Budget cuts had been defined in terms of current services, meaning the cost of maintaining a program from one year to the next was adjusted for inflation and for increases in the number of people offered the service or subsidy involved. That way, even if more money went into a program, it was deemed to have been cut if the increase did n't keep pace with inflation and caseloads. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> budget changed that. `` We are being conned,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, the new director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>. `` There are an awful lot of politicians who are calling things cuts that are n't cuts.'' The logic applies in the opposite direction, too. Measured the old way, the domestic budget freeze represents a cut of at least $ 9.6 billion. Itemized cuts have yet to come; <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said those should emerge in negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` Mine is a budget that will not work with business as usual,'' he said in one of three speeches he gave on the road in a quick campaign to promote his budget while <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was in recess. `` It will require a partnership with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. My team and I are prepared to work with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, to negotiate in good faith with the leadership, to work day and night if that's what it takes to meet budget targets and to produce a budget on time.'' On time would mean passage of the 13 appropriations bills that finance the federal government by Oct. 1, the government new year. That deadline had n't been met in a dozen years until 1988, when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was spurred by crisis _ the stock market collapse of October, 1987. Instead, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wound up passing resolutions to continue federal spending at earlier rates so the government would n't run out of money. Sometimes it did, before the catchall resolutions were approved. Often they were giant, incomprehensible, last-minute measures, sometimes passed before members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could read the law they were writing. As a candidate, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said flatly that he would not tolerate the practice. But there is little chance that, absent a crisis like the Wall Street crash, the on-time appropriations performance of 1988 can be repeated in 1989. According to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the administration will set out areas and guidelines for budget cuts, with specifics to await negotiation with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, the president's press secretary, said that should avoid confrontation. `` We want it to be cooperative, a partnership kind of arrangement,'' he said. While it lasts, that's a partnership in which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ca n't lose. The strain will start showing when Democrats insist on negotiating _ and voting _ not just on cuts but on increases in their priority programs.

 Veteran globe-trotter <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sets out Wednesday on his first overseas journey as president, a fast-paced trip to three Asian nations anxious about <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s budget problems and its military commitments abroad. Over 5 -LCB- days, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will travel to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and back home again. More than 36 hours of his time will be spent on Air Force One flying from place to place. Playing down expectations, White House officials said the trip offers an opportunity to demonstrate resolve and affinity with friends and the region. `` It would be unreasonable to expect major resolution of policy issues four weeks into the administration,'' one official said. `` Symbolically it's important,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalapino </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. `` There's no region in the world in which we have greater economic, political and strategic interests. The trip originated with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to attend the funeral Friday of Japanese Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, which will attract scores of world leaders. The president has defended his decision to attend the funeral amid criticism from those who still resent <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s role in World War II. `` I'm doing what's right,'' the president said recently. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> aviator whose plane was shot down by the Japanese in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> in 1944, said, `` We have a good relationship with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. I want to see it even better. And this does n't concern me a bit. And you're talking to a person who was in combat in World War II. I feel you look ahead, not always look back. You do what's right. Taking advantage of the occasion, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will hold separate talks in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> with 16 to 20 heads of state or government, including <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> and Philippine President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s trip comes at a time of concern in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> that budget and trade deficits could prompt the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to scale down its defense commitments or to demand that allies shoulder a bigger share of regional security costs. In particular, there are tensions over the big trade imbalances that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` There is a good deal of anxiety in this region about the future of the American economy, the degree to which our strategic commitments might be cut back,'' said <PERSON> Scalapino </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will meet in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, their second visit in three weeks following a White House conference Feb. 2. White House officials believe <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s attention will be diverted by the funeral and his role as host for foreign dignitaries, and that there will not be much opportunity to tackle substantive issues After two nights in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will fly to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for a nostalgic visit to a country where he served for more than a year as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy. He will visit major landmarks such as the Great Hall of the People and meet with Chinese leaders, including 84-year-old <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> and Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will spend two nights in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and then take an early morning flight to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. With anti-Americanism on the rise from both the left and the right, <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> is bracing for demonstrations during <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s stop. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be there less than five hours, visiting President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae </PERSON> <PERSON> Woo </PERSON> at the presidential palace called the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and delivering a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Traveling by helicopter, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will not be exposed to any disruptions by demonstrators. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who visited 74 countries in his eight years as vice president, stopped in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> during a 1982 journey. He visited <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> again in 1984 and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> again in 1985. Some commentators have suggested that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> _ before any trip to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> _ is a snub to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> denied that he was trying to play <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> off against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, saying recently, `` There's nothing of that nature in this visit.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> comes amid a warming in relations between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will go to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in May for the first Sino-Soviet summit in three decades. <PERSON> Scalapino </PERSON> said he expects <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will welcome improvement in Sino-Soviet relations `` because they may make possible settlements of some of the more thorny political issues in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>,'' such as the divisions between <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that since he already would be in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, a stop in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` just seemed like an appropriate visit.'' Administration officials said it would have been a slight to the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government if he did n't stop there, as well. `` The very fact he's giving a public speech is in itself of some significance,'' said <PERSON> Scalapino </PERSON>. `` How many presidents have addressed the <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>?''

<HEAD>`Rugged Individualism' Hurting American Business, Specialist Says</HEAD>

 An American management guru credited with helping to pull <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s business out of the rubble of World War II says he wishes his own country would adopt his methods. <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> <PERSON> Deming </PERSON>, an 88-year-old statistician and scientist who built a management style stressing quality and worker happiness, said <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is headed for more trade woes if it clings to the `` rugged individualism, win-lose'' approach in running business. `` It's short-term thinking. Much of our talent is spent churning money, looking for a takeover,'' <PERSON> Deming </PERSON> told about 500 students, faculty and business leaders Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a win-lose system. It's rugged individualism out of which comes the so-called merit system. Competition means increase your share of the market _ ` I win, you lose.''' Snubbed by American companies in the 1950s, <PERSON> Deming </PERSON> took his ideas to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where businesses decided they had nothing to lose and adopted his theories. Since then, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> created the Deming Prizes, based on a medal of honor he received from Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>. Some of the Deming Prize winners, such as Fuji Photo and <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION>, are among the most successful in penetrating American markets. Starting about 1980, some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses began expressing interest in the Deming method, but significant commitment has yet to jell, said <PERSON> Deming </PERSON>, who jets around to various corporations to teach his methods. Some of his main points: _ Do n't make quick profits and stock prices the main corporate objectives _ Make quality control, from the procurement of materials on up, a high priority, since it actually brings down the cost of production _ Work closely with as few suppliers as possible and do n't automatically sign contracts with the lowest _ Assign responsibility for good product design at the top management echelon <PERSON> Deming </PERSON> likened the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to a colony, selling off its metal, real estate and other raw materials while buying finished goods from other countries. `` Forty-four percent of the real estate in downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> is owned by the Japanese,'' he said. `` Our natural resources are petering out. How can this be? Things were so good,'' he said of the country's prosperous post-war years. `` We ship out aluminum, nickel, coal, real estate, scrap metal. A colony ships out raw materials and buys back manufactured goods,'' he said. `` We've become a colony.'' He also decried the grading and evaluations systems used by American managers and educators. `` The so-called merit system has destroyed us,'' he said. `` What are grades? They are predictions. A high grade is a prediction that -LRB- a worker -RRB- will perform well 10 years from now under conditions nobody would dare foretell. `` People are entitled to joy in learning ... joy in work,'' he said. `` Rugged individualism _ the days when it could work passed about three decades ago. We must change our economics to cooperation. Everybody wins. Equally? No, but everybody -LRB- is -RRB- better.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' Machinist union members talked about `` getting even'' as they overwhelming supported a strike against the troubled carrier if no contract is reached by a March 3 federal deadline. `` Ever since -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> took over, it's like the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has taken us over,'' union member <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said at a packed union hall meeting Wednesday night `` At last we can do something _ strike. Everybody has been looking forward to that. It's getting even time.'' Union leader <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> announced Wednesday that 97 percent of the voting membership had authorized a strike if no contract was reached by midnight March 3, when a federally imposed, 30-day cooling off period expires. Eastern could then impose its own work rules. The Miami-based carrier says it has focused on negotiating a settlement, but the union maintains <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has been stalling the talks and has n't engaged in true bargaining. `` They have not moved in 16 months in their original opening position,'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said. Eastern worker <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Knaak </PERSON>, who has been working on strike contingency plans while on a 30-day suspension for walking out in a dispute over mandatory overtime, said <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has not budged while the union has made some concessions. `` I do n't think <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> wants a settlement,'' <PERSON> Knaak </PERSON> said. The union also contended that management has started recruitment of possible strikebreakers. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, representing 8,500 machinists, baggage handlers and other ground workers, have been working without a contract for 13 months. If there is no resolution by late next week, federal mediators plan to bring both sides together in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The Machinists represent more than a quarter of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s work force. Eastern management has been seeking substantial contract concessions, saying the union members' wages are too high and have made the airline non-competitive. Meanwhile, the carrier charged that an illegal work slowdown has backed up 19 aircraft and delayed flights. Eastern attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> charged in federal court Wednesday that the Machinists have caused the aircraft backup by taking twice the normal time to perform tasks ranging from routine mechanical inspections to major overhauls. `` Historically we have had no backup,'' the attorney said. `` We would normally only have a certain number -LRB- of planes -RRB- in being done and then put back in service.'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> called the charge `` a smokescreen. The work is being done.'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s recent performance _ it advertises itself as the No. 1 on-time operator in the industry, citing federal figures _ refutes the carrier's allegation of widespread work slowdowns. `` How could that possibly be going on if our people are slowing down?'' he said. The airline and union also pressed their arguments in federal court Wednesday regarding the subcontracting of work traditionally done by organized labor. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Senior District Judge <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> agreed to accept the Machinists subcontracting case, after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kehoe </PERSON> granted <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s motion Wednesday to send the case to <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON>, who ordered an end to a wildcat strike by ground crews last week, directed Eastern to file a response in the subcontracting case by noon today. In an amended complaint filed Tuesday, the airline said it had no choice but to subtract certain work because of `` circumstances beyond its control.'' In another development, the union charged that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has started recruiting strikebreakers with newspaper ads offering airport opportunities for baggage handlers, agents and managers but listing no employer.

<HEAD>Healthier Frozen Dinner Line Stems From Chairman's Heart Attack</HEAD>

 The country's healthiest line of supermarket frozen dinners owes its existence to the heart attack of an agribusiness giant _ <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>, the 6-foot-6 chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The idea for a lower-fat, lower-salt line of frozen dinners came to <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> as he lay recuperating from the heart attack that struck him on a business trip Sept. 14, 1985, he says. Healthy Choice was served up to the national press Wednesday on plastic trays by maroon-jacketed waiters at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s posh Plaza hotel, with <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> on the dais. `` This is n't just for people on restricted diets. This is for healthy people that like to be healthy,'' <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> said in an interview. The low-calorie segment of the frozen dinner market is the fastest-growing, expanding an average of 24 percent a year from 1983 to 1987, according to <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a market research firm. It estimated that 1987 sales of low-calorie meals reached $ 1.5 billion. <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> said he issued the challenge to his research and development staff after his wife, <PERSON> Josie </PERSON>, invented some healthful but tasty dishes at home, convincing him that <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> could do the same. `` To make it taste good _ that was the toughest thing. There's an entertainment value to food,'' he said. Other low-calorie frozen dinner lines have some dishes that are low in fat and relatively low in salt, but <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION>'s entry is more consistently healthy, nutrition experts said. Healthy Choice meets the dietary recommendations of the American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, although it does not have their endorsement. `` A consumer can buy the Healthy Choice and know that they're going to get lower sodium, lower fat With the others you have to read the label to find out,'' <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Tribole </PERSON>, a dietitian and spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dietetic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview. Most companies do a lot of their calorie-cutting simply by making portions smaller, Ms. <PERSON> Tribole </PERSON> said. Healthy Choice portions are heavier than the competition's. <PERSON> Darlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON>, president of the association, said the closest products to Healthy Choice are frozen-dinner lines that <ORGANIZATION> Baxter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Specialty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> sell to health-care facilities for distribution to patients. <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> is second in the overall frozen-dinner market, with a 28 percent share, behind <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s 29 percent, according to Business Trends. <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION>'s other principal brands are Banquet, <ORGANIZATION> Armour </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>, Patio, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> and Sensible Chef. Healthy Choice is already available in about a quarter of the country. <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> has no plans to reduce fat and salt in all its frozen-dinner brands, even though it would make them more healthful, <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> said. `` We will continue to make products that people want.'' As an example of Healthy Choice's nutritional breakdown, its chicken parmigiana dinner has 290 calories, 65 milligrams of cholesterol and 320 milligrams of sodium. It derives 15 percent of its calories from fat, and 6 percent of those calories from saturated fat. By comparison, <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Menu </ORGANIZATION> chicken parmigiana dinner has 380 calories, 890 milligrams of sodium and 43 percent of its calories from fat. Figures on cholesterol and saturated fat are not available. The Weight Watchers brand equivalent, which is an entree rather than a full meal, has 280 calories, 85 milligrams of cholesterol, 840 milligrams of sodium, 51 percent of its calories from fat, and 19 percent of those calories from saturated fat.

<HEAD>Analysts Divided On Whether Bhopal Settlement Increases Takeover
Chances</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> could face another takeover attempt now that the cloud of the <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> gas leak has lifted, though the rise in its stock price after the settlement was announced could provide protection, analysts say. Carbide agreed Tuesday to a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> ruling that ordered the company to pay $ 470 million by March 31 to settle all claims stemming from the 1984 accident, which killed more than 3,300 people. The settlement, which is expected to have only a minor effect on the company's earnings, ended speculation about how much the <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> incident would cost Danbury-based Carbide. `` There are a lot of companies that would be interested in the mix and quality of Carbide's component assets,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sahgal </PERSON>, director of research at <ORGANIZATION> Ladenburg </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thalmann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It's just a guessing game, but what one can certainly focus on is the undervaluation of Carbide's assets in the marketplace,'' he said Wednesday. `` It's an upstock. It's attractive for investors. The risk reward looks quite compelling.'' News of the settlement sent <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>'s stock soaring by $ 2 a share Tuesday in heavy trading to close at $ 31.125. It advanced another $ 1.375 Wednesday to $ 32.50, its highest level over the past year. `` I'm in the camp that says -LRB- the settlement -RRB- does not make them a more attractive candidate,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilbur </PERSON>, a vice president with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc. in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` While the settlement of the <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> issues does relieve that concern about liability ... the increase in the price yesterday makes a takeover about $ 270 million more expensive.'' Even before the settlement, <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> was rife with speculation that a takeover bid could emerge. One rumor Feb. 7 pushed Carbide up $ 2 a share with more than 9.16 million shares traded, several times the ordinary volume. There has been talk that Carbide might fetch $ 50 a share as the target of a takeover fight, which would make the total value of the company about $ 7 billion. Carbide has approximately 140 million shares outstanding. Three names have been mentioned as possible suitors, including investor <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Safra </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Safra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION>, an unidentified West German chemical Co. and <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, the well-known takeover strategist. <PERSON> Wilbur </PERSON> suggested that last week's surge simply reflected investors' desire to take advantage of the 25 percent increase in the company's quarterly dividend, from 20 to 25 cents a share. Carbide increased its dividend in January after slashing it from $ 1.50 to 80 cents a share last summer. The move traumatized stockholders and sent stock plummeting to about $ 17 a share. That would have been a more logical time to attempt a takeover, <PERSON> Wilbur </PERSON> said. `` We have identified at least at eight other companies that would produce returns to a takeover group that would be higher than Union Carbide'' right now, he said. One stock speculator who requested anonymity said the takeover talk is `` probably all hot air.'' `` Right now it's just a $ 7 billion company that does n't have the overhang anymore,'' he said. `` But there are lots of company's that do n't have an overhang.'' Carbide is vastly different from the far-flung, flourishing conglomerate it was before the <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> catastrophe. It was well known for consumer products ranging from Eveready batteries to Glad sandwich bags. Its stock fell from about $ 50 a share to about $ 35 after the disaster, leading to a hostile takeover attempt by the much-smaller <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1985. To fight the takeover, <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> sold its consumer divisions and undertook other drastic restructuring steps, including the sale and lease-back of its headquarters building. Sales slipped to $ 6.4 billion in 1985 and the company's work force was halved. Even before Tuesday's settlement, analysts had said <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> was well on its way back. In the year ended Dec. 31, the company earned $ 720 million, or $ 5.31 a share, on revenue of $ 8.32 billion. That compared with 1987 earnings of $ 231 million, or $ 1.76 a share, on revenue of $ 6.91 billion.

<TEXT>
 Federal regulators have intensified three separate investigations of alleged braking problems and other safety defects involving more than 2 million <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> cars. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it had received 428 complaints of poor braking in <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s A -, J - and N-body cars made in 1987 and The alleged braking problems, according to the unconfirmed complaints, had resulted in 85 accidents and 29 injuries, <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said. The complaints said drivers of the cars had reported brake failure in some cases and in others an increase in braking distance to beyond the limits of safety. The A-body cars are the Pontiac 6000, <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Celebrity </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Cutlass </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ciera </LOCATION>. The J-body cars are the <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Skyhawk </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cavalier </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pontiac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunbird </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cadillac </PERSON> <PERSON> Cimarron </PERSON> and <PERSON> Oldsmobile </PERSON> <PERSON> Cutlass </PERSON>. The N-body cars are the <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Skylark </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Cutlass </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Calais </LOCATION> and Pontiac Grand Am. The cars use the same brake components, <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said. The agency also raised to an engineering analysis its investigation of allegations that the doors of <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s 1987 and 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beretta </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Corsica </LOCATION> sometimes fall off when opened due to defective door-hinge pins. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said 540,000 vehicles were involved in the investigation. The agency had received 277 unconfirmed reports of doors falling off, eight of which allegedly involved injury. In the third <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> case, <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> upgraded its probe of power-steering problems on the 1987 <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> Firebird and <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Camaro </ORGANIZATION> cars. The agency said it had received 403 unconfirmed complaints, including five accidents and one injury, that brackets and bolts suddenly fractured, causing a loss of power-steering assistance. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> declined to give a detailed response to each case. `` As always, we'll cooperate with <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` However, just because there is an investigation, it does not mean there are any defects present.'' Asked if the upgrading of an investigation would suggest the presence of a defect, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said the company would stand by its statement. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> also opened five low-level investigations into safety allegations involving cars. The agency opened preliminary evaluations into allegations of: _ Seat belt jamming in 50,000 1987-1988 Mercury Tracers made by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> _ Rear-window stop light failure in 1.2 million 1988 GM A - and J-body 2-door coupes _ Brake light failure on 2,500 Rolls <PERSON> Royce </PERSON> cars made from 1987 through 1989 _ Sudden movement of the front seat in 150,000 1983-1986 Subarus _ Defective windshield wipers in 50,000 1986-1987 Yugos The agency also closed six investigations with the conclusion there was `` no defect trend.'' The cases involved unsubstantiated complaints of: _ Seat-belt latch failure in the 1984 Ford Mustang _ Engine compartment fires in the 1980-1988 Ford Crown <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> _ Trunk fires in the 1987-1988 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Dodge </PERSON> <PERSON> Daytona </PERSON>. _ Oil leaks in the 1984 Subaru GL _ Battery cable grounding problems in the 1988 Saab 900 Turbo _ Front seat-back failure in the 1981 Ford Escort and Mustang

 The founder of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s largest brokerage firm has declared his innocence on charges of illegal trading and criminal fraud following his arraignment at a <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> prison. `` I hope there will be justice. I'm innocent. I believe in the Mexican laws,'' said <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Legoretta </PERSON>, board chairman and a founder of Operadora de Bolsa, after being arraigned Wednesday at the city's <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penitentiary </LOCATION> <PERSON> Legoretta </PERSON> and three other top stock brokerage officials were arrested on Monday and later charged with illegal trading related to the October 1987 Mexican stock market crash. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON> <PERSON> Villareal </PERSON> said no officials of the former presidential administration would be investigated in connection with the crash, the <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. A government investigation continues into complaints against nearly all <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s brokerage houses after stockholders lost about $ 7 million in the crash. The government has said it may seek arrests or sanctions against another 148 stockbrokers. The fraud complaints surfaced after <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s market index plummeted 74 percent in 28 trading days in October 1987. <PERSON> Legoretta </PERSON>, 44, belongs to one of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s wealthiest families. His arrest at a <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> restaurant Monday night shook the country ` sbusiness <PERSON> Legoretta </PERSON> told reporters the charges were motivated by what he claimed were exaggerated and false reports of his personal wealth. `` I'm not very rich, I'm not as rich as they're saying. I have two houses, three cars, and own 30 percent of a yacht. And I earn as a stockbroker 20 million pesos a month -LRB- roughly $ 8,700 -RRB-,'' he said. Also charged were <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceballos </PERSON> <PERSON> Cervantes </PERSON>, Operadora's director of investment promotions, and <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuevo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Dupont </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Mexicana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> e </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inversiones </ORGANIZATION>, another major brokerage house. Attorney General <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> on Tuesday said Operadora de Bolsa allegedly sold non-existent <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> certificates and falsified clients' trading records. Mexicana de Valores allegedly traded in securities without clients' consent, he said. Convictions on the charges could result in jail terms of up to 12 years for criminal fraud and 10 years for securities trading violations. <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON> said the 18-month government investigation did not unearth wrongdoing by officials of the administration of former President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> reported. New President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> took office in December.

But <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, president of a group of investors who say they were defrauded, estimated the brokerage firms netted $ 43.5 million in profits from alleged illegal trading. The penal court judge supervising the case had three days from Wednesday's arraignment to determine whether the charges warrant formal indictments or to let the four officials go free.

 Four years after it acquired G.C. <ORGANIZATION> Murphy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in a $ 200 million takeover battle, <ORGANIZATION> Ames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is considering offers to sell the McKeesport-based discount store chain.

<HEAD>London Shares Near Low At Midday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Share prices were lower at midday Thursday, pressured by continuing fears about the world interest rate outlook and some large sell-orders organized by British brokerage firms. Attention was fixed on Friday's release of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s retail price index for January, which was expected to show that the annual inflation rate rose above 7 percent last month, dealers said. The West German <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> council's decision to leave its key interest rate unchanged at 6 percent at its fortnightly meeting Thursday did n't soothe the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market's concerns about a general rise in world interest rates, said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON>, an analyst at the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Warburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. Most market participants believe the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> has merely postponed an expected half percentage point rate rise, <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON> added. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was off 17.1 points, or 0.8 percent, at 2,030.4 at about 1 p.m. in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, having traded as much as 18 points lower an hour earlier. The index fell steadily from its morning high of 0.9 point up. Volume was 426.4 million shares compared with 225.4 million shares at the same time Wednesday. Dealers said they saw little buying interest in the market during the morning session. Several British brokerage firms organized sell programs that pushed the leading blue chip stocks lower, they said.

<HEAD>Beef Prices Rise during January</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Average retail beef prices across the nation rose 6 cents a pound over the last month, the Denver-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cattlemen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said. Reporting on its monthly 19-city survey of supermarket beef prices Wednesday, the association said the average price of five cuts on Feb. 9 was $ 2.93 per pound, up from $ 2.87 per pound on Jan. 12. There apparently was less retail featuring _ or special pricing _ of beef and more efforts to market cheaper meats, which are in large supply, said the association, which noted beef production has decreased recently. Compared with a month earlier, the February five-cut average was up in 12 cities and down in seven. The price average also was affected by a long-term trend of higher demand and higher prices for the more convenient beef steaks and a somewhat lower demand for the less convenient cuts like chuck roast, the association said. Over the last month, the national average ground beef price was unchanged at $ 1.42 and chuck roast rose only slightly to $ 1.88. Other averages were round steak, $ 2.71; sirloin steak, $ 3.57; and T-bone steak, $ 5.08. The individual city averages for the five cuts ranged from $ 3.75 per pound in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to $ 2.37 in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, with the highest individual cut price $ 6.32 per pound for T-bone steak in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and the lowest $ 1.11 for ground beef in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>.

 Housing construction jumped 8 percent in January, the biggest monthly advance in nearly a year, the government said today in a report providing fresh evidence of robust economic activity. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said new homes and apartments were built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.69 million units last month, up from the 1.57 million rate in December. Last month's gain, attributed in part to an unusually warm winter in much of the country, followed a revised 0.1 percent gain in December and a 2.3 percent rise in November. January's was the biggest monthly increase since construction climbed 8.6 percent in February 1988, and was the highest level of activity since March 1987, when construction took place at an annual rate of 1.72 million units. The home building news was the latest in a series of recent government reports showing considerable economic strength. On Wednesday, a report said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories continued to operate at their highest rate in a decade in January, flirting with output levels that could strain their capacity and lead to inflation. Stock and bond prices rose in spite of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s report Wednesday. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks broke the 2,300-point barrier as it rose 22.68 points to 2,303.93. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said January's operating rate of 84.4 percent of capacity was unchanged from December. The December figure was revised upward from an earlier estimate of 84.2 percent. The operating rate for January and December has not been surpassed since October 1979, when factories were functioning at 84.6 percent of capacity. `` Historically, capacity utilization rates of around 85 percent are the flashpoints for a speedup in inflation,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> DeFina </PERSON>, senior economist for <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` There are signs that things are getting tight, that inflation pressures are building.'' In a related report Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> reported that its industrial production index in January climbed 0.3 percent following a revised increase of 0.5 percent in December. January's increase was paced by a 0.5 percent rise in manufacturing production. As use of industrial capacity rises, so does concern that factories will have trouble keeping up with orders, leading to shortages and price increases. Although some economists said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> needs to tighten credit to cool off production and slow inflation, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahn </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, said the reports indicate industrial expansion was unnecessarily restrained by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s tightening. `` Further hiking of the rates will restrict investment in capacity equipment even more and hold down further growth in capacity,'' <PERSON> Rahn </PERSON> said. A third economic report released Wednesday showed that business inventories rose 0.9 percent in December while sales jumped 0.8 percent, leaving the ratio of inventories to sales unchanged at 1.50.

<TEXT>
 British <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday its after-tax profit rose 5 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, its results constrained by low crude oil prices For the three months ended Dec. 31, <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> said its after-tax profit totaled 272 million pounds, or about $ 481 million at current exchange rates, on an historical cost basis compared with 260 million pounds in the same period a year earlier. The historical cost figure includes inventory losses or gains and is comparable to the first in first out -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> FIFO </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- accounting method. On a current cost basis, which values the company's oil inventories at existing prices and is more in line with the typical American system of last in first out -LRB- LIFO -RRB-, after-tax profit fell 23 percent to 304 million pounds, or the equivalent of $ 538 million, from 394 million pounds in the year ago period. Earnings per share came to 4.5 pence, or about 8 cents, up slightly from 4.4 pence. Fourth-quarter sales fell 9 percent to 6.4 billion pounds from 7 billion pounds in the 1987 period. Oil and gas exploration and production results suffered from weak crude prices, despite the benefits of integrating <ORGANIZATION> Britoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, which BP acquired late in 1987, the oil giant said. <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION>'s refining and marketing businesses provided a `` partial hedge,'' helped by good demand for products and lower costs, the company said. For all of 1988, after-tax profit fell 13 percent to 1.21 billion pounds on an historical cost basis from 1.39 billion pounds in 1987. Current cost after-tax profit rose 10 percent to 1.44 billion pounds from 1.31 billion pounds. Per-share earnings for the year declined to 20 pence from 24.9 pence. Sales in 1988 fell 8 percent to 25.9 billion pounds from 28.3 billion pounds.

Venezuelan president <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Peerez </PERSON>, who took office two weeks ago, is scheduled to address the nation to outline a package of adjustments Thursday evening. The Venezuelan economy has been badly hit in recent years with the slide in oil prices and the service of its $ 33 billion debt, the fourth largest in the hemisphere. The economic reforms to be announced will include a currency devaluation between 45 and 55 percent, according to government sources. Other measures will include unification of an exchange system blamed for draining the country's reserves the past several years, liberation of bank interest rates, and elimination of price controls.

 <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> wo n't discuss his position on <ORGANIZATION> Centaur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>' increased offer for the company, while <ORGANIZATION> Centaur </ORGANIZATION> today announced it has scheduled a special shareholders' meeting on the offer The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm, in a statement, said it scheduled the meeting for March 30 at <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinard </PERSON> said the company had no comment. She also said no date had been set for a <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> board meeting where, according to <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON>, the board will consider <ORGANIZATION> Centaur </ORGANIZATION>'s latest offer. Centaur on Tuesday raised its offer from $ 100 to $ 110 per share for the chemical company. Its proposals to shareholders include removing all members of the <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> board and electing new directors nominated by Centaur. `` It is obviously a higher price,'' <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday. `` What conclusions the board will come to will have to wait for -LRB- a special board -RRB- meeting to take place.'' He did not disclose a date for the meeting. <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s stock climbed Wednesday to $ 114.125, up $ 1 in trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think we have to consider any offer seriously,'' <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> said. `` And we considered the first one seriously. After that serious consideration, we came up with a very firm conclusion that one, it was not a bona fide offer and was highly conditional. Two, it was certainly inadequate. And three, the Centaur people were not very worthy.'' Centaur, which has sought a shareholder meeting in the absence of a meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> board, claims the partnership gained enough support to have a shareholder meeting called. <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> sought an injunction to block the meeting, but a federal judge last week affirmed <ORGANIZATION> Centaur </ORGANIZATION>'s right to have it called. The company has filed an appeal. `` We have the financing,'' <ORGANIZATION> Centaur </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Seeman </PERSON> said. `` We are not investing in <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> to destroy it. ... It is for the shareholders to decide the merits of our offer. Not Mr. <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> alone.''

<HEAD>Little Early Movement In Grain, Soybean Futures</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Wheat futures prices opened mixed while other grain and soybean futures were nearly unchanged in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. A pickup in export demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat, including a purchase by <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> of 125,000 metric tons at subsidized prices, gave old-crop wheat futures a boost at the opening bell. But forecasts for precipitation in some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> winter wheat areas kept a lid on those gains and encouraged selling of new-crop wheat contracts, analysts said. Corn and soybeans were little changed in early trading, defying expectations that soybean futures prices would extend Wednesday's gains In early trading, wheat was 1 \ cents lower to 1 -LCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.26 -RCB- a bushel; corn was unchanged to \ cent lower with March at $ 2.71 a bushel; oats were unchanged to -RCB- cent higher with March at $ 2.09 a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to -LCB- cent lower with March at $ 7.38 -LCB- a bushel Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> ahead of this afternoon's <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> monthly report on the number of cattle on feedlots in the seven largest cattle-producing states.

<TEXT>
 A tentative contract proposal from <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has been rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union local representing company employees, officials said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> proposal, including some provisions for 11 percent raises in the first year, was rejected by Teamsters local no. 19 by a vote of 1,058 to 242, union officials said. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnette </PERSON>, local president, said about 70 percent of the estimated 2,000 union members cast ballots in the election. Main opposition to the contract came in the way raises would be phased in among workers with different experience levels, he said. Teamsters and <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> officials said they would return to the bargaining table. The contract, dating from 1983, became amendable last Dec. 1. Voting began in late January after <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> and union officials said they had reached a tentative agreement. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s baggage handlers, ticket and reservations agents and clerical and office workers are represented by the Teamsters. Either the airline or the union, under the Federal Railway Labor Act, can request federal mediation if the contract dispute is n't resolved <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> was acquired by investors last summer, shifted most of its flight operations to <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and began trying to attract more business travelers by increasing its daily departure schedules. It recently ordered more than $ 2 billion worth of new airplanes. The airline announced last week that it will move its headquarters from <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and expand support facilities in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to the tune of $ 40 million and 1,400 jobs in the next year. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s labor costs average $ 1.15 per available seat mile, the lowest of any large <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>. By contrast, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' labor costs average $ 2.64 per available seat mile. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> took pay cuts of about 30 percent after the airline emerged from bankruptcy under new ownership in 1983.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> today said it earned $ 1.16 billion during the final three months of last year and $ 5.3 billion for all of 1988, outearning much larger <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for the third straight year. The quarterly earnings were up 24.2 percent from 1987's fourth quarter. Annual earnings for the nation's No. 2 automaker rose 14.5 percent over the $ 4.63 billion <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> earned in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday it earned $ 4.86 billion in 1988, and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> reported earlier that it made $ 1.05 billion last year. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings pushed 1988 profits for the Big Three to $ 11.21 billion, breaking the companies' combined annual earnings record of $ 9.79 billion set in 1984. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s fourth-quarter earnings, which worked out to $ 2.42 a share, came on sales of $ 23.91 billion. During the same period last year, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 932 million, or $ 1.87 a share, on sales of $ 20.99 billion. For the year, earnings came to $ 10.96 a share, compared with $ 9.05 a share on profits of $ 4.63 billion in 1987. Sales for 1988 were $ 92.45 billion, compared with $ 79.89 billion the year before, an increase of 15.7 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s fourth-quarter earnings set a company record for profits during the last three months of any year, and extended to 11 the number of three-month periods that <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has had record quarterly profits. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said earnings for its financial services fell 19.4 percent, to $ 691 million last year from $ 857 million in 1987. The decline was paced by lower interest profits and higher credit losses. The company's overseas automotive operations set an annual earnings record, contributing $ 2.1 billion to the overall profit figure. Increased earnings were reported in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, as <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> more than doubled its 1987 overseas profits. Earnings in its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automotive operations last year amounted to $ 2.5 billion, down 9.1 percent from the $ 2.7 billion <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> earned in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1987. The company said higher product and marketing costs last year more than offset profits from higher car market share and strong sales. Ford Treasurer and Vice President for Finance <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McCammon </PERSON> said he expects <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> to issue profit-sharing checks of between $ 2,100 and $ 3,700 to hourly workers. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said it would announce profit sharing Friday.

 A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> financier and a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> businessman pleaded innocent Thursday to a massive tax fraud scam in which they allegedly faked more than $ 38 billion in trades in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government securities. <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, 43, of Rye, and <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Manko </PERSON>, 48, of <LOCATION> Lighthouse </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, were released on $ 500,000 bonds after appearing before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernikow </PERSON>. <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> is the brother of prominent Wall Street takeover strategist <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, who was not implicated in the alleged scheme said to involve $ 511 million in illegal tax writeoffs. <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Manko </PERSON> were charged with conspiracy to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and numerous counts of making false statements to the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> or aiding others to do so. A hearing to determine a trial date in the case, which the government said is at least as large as any previous one of its type, was set for Feb. 24 before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>. <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Manko </PERSON> surrendered their passports and were barred from leaving the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

Authorities said investors, including billionaire <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kluge </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Metromedia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and the late fashion designer <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, were unwitting participants in the scheme and are n't under investigation. <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Manko </PERSON> were accused of creating more than $ 38 billion in `` pre-arranged, rigged and fraudulent'' transactions in government securities to generate losses for investors in numerous limited partnerships, which the investors could write off against their taxes. The scheme involved at least 15 partnerships between 1982 and 1986, the indictment said. Both <PERSON> Manko </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> were charged with conspiracy, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine. <PERSON> Manko </PERSON> was charged with 24 false statement counts and <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> was charged with 25 similar counts, each of which carries up to three years in prison and a $ 5,000 fine.

 <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON>, president and chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, says he has `` not ruled out any options'' for cutting the company's losses, including the sale of part or all of the computer business. But <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> said Wednesday that options under consideration also include seeking equity partners to help turn around the computer business, which had operating losses of about $ 130 million last year. His comments came in response to a question during an interview about widespread rumors that <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> is about to sell its computer operations. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has been mentioned most often as the buyer. `` It's too early to tell if we have to sell portions of the computer business,'' said <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON>, dismissing published reports that <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> representatives recently visited the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> supercomputer subsidiary. `` We have <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> and every other -LRB- computer -RRB- manufacturer visiting ETA,'' said <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON>, who was named to his current posts in December. `` We're trying to sell them on <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> as a compatible supercomputer with their mainframes.'' <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> would prefer to keep the computer business more or less intact, but he acknowledged that there's `` no question that one of the ways to help make computers profitable is to find the right kind of partner. `` We do n't have to own all of <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> or the Cyber group -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION>'s mainframe computer business -RRB- for that matter.''

<TEXT>
 Stock prices fell Thursday amid continued concern about the outlook for world interest rates as traders sat back to await Friday's release of British inflation figures. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 30-share index was down 10.2 points at 1,667.2 at the close. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 500-share index fell 5.53 points to close at 1,153.57. Volume rose to 644.1 million shares from Wednesday's 468.5 million shares, but much of this gain was said to come from program trades. Prices were hit early as several British brokerage firms conducted large program trades, dealers said. But a mostly apathetic market failed to reignite much movement upward from depressed levels. `` The -LRB- program trades -RRB- took the fire out of the market,'' one dealer said. There was n't any noticeable relief after the West German <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> failed to raise interest rates at a meeting Thursday, as many players had expected. Instead, it merely perpetuated the market's uncertainty about whether worldwide rates were headed higher, dealers said. `` The feeling is that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> will increase their rates anyway,'' said one equity salesman.

<HEAD>British Aerospace Subsidiary to Cut 2,500 Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 British Aerospace -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> -RRB- </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a guided weapons manufacturing subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, will cut 2,500 jobs by the end of the 1990s and close two of its six major sites, the company said Thursday. British Aerospace said an internal review had concluded that the cuts in its workforce of 13,500 and the shutting down of some sites were necessary to improve efficiency. `` We currently have a wasteful duplication of facilities and resources which, when consolidated and rationalized, will improve utilization and efficiency,'' the company said in a statement. `` The measures we are taking are designed solely to protect our -LRB- guided weapons -RRB- business over the next decade and beyond,'' said <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> in a brief separate statement. A union representing workers at the London-based company, the Manufacturing, <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, described the planned job cuts as an `` outrage.'' The British Aerospace statement said the company would `` consult and discuss with employees and their representatives the various methods'' of implementing the reductions. The company said it would close manufacturing sites at <ORGANIZATION> Bracknell </ORGANIZATION>, northwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> in central <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, as well as closing a small guided weapons plant in <LOCATION> Hatfield </LOCATION>, on the northern outskirts of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.

 Stock prices fell Thursday amid continued concern about the outlook for world interest rates as traders sat back to await Friday's release of British inflation figures. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 30-share index was down 10.2 points at 1,667.2 at the close. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 500-share index fell 5.53 points to close at 1,153.57. Volume rose to 644.1 million shares from Wednesday's 468.5 million shares, but much of this gain was said to come from program trades. Prices were hit early as several British brokerage firms conducted large program trades, dealers said. But a mostly apathetic market failed to reignite much movement upward from depressed levels. `` The -LRB- program trades -RRB- took the fire out of the market,'' one dealer said. There was n't any noticeable relief after the West German <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> failed to raise interest rates at a meeting Thursday, as many players had expected. Instead, it merely perpetuated the market's uncertainty about whether worldwide rates were headed higher, dealers said. `` The feeling is that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> will increase their rates anyway,'' said one equity salesman. Players eagerly awaited Friday's release of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s retail price index, which could bear on the outlook for British rates. The annual inflation rate is expected to have risen to 7.3 percent in January from 6.8 percent in December.

 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday unveiled what it called the world's fastest memory chip, one capable of sending and receiving more than 6 billion bits of data per second. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said the static random access memory -LRB- SRAM -RRB- chip was for fast machines such as mainframes and supercomputers that need to store information in memory banks and retrieve it at high speeds. The chip was discussed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuits </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, the world chip industry's biggest annual research meeting.

One micron is one-hundredth the width of a human hair. On Wednesday at the conference, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced an SRAM chip that is slightly slower but holds eight times as much information. SRAM chips are faster but more expensive and have less capacity than the more common memory chips known as dynamic random access memories, or DRAMs.

<BYLINE>Opposition Questions Former Prime Minister's Role in Scandal ^By

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Opposition lawmakers charged Thursday that former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> played a key role in a widening scandal over bargain stock deals offered to political and business leaders. <PERSON> Tsuruo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON>, secretary general of the opposition socialists, demanded that Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s government summon <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> for questioning by a parliamentary committee. He alleged <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> provided <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, at the center of the scandal, with special favors by ordering <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Posts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> to buy supercomputers from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for use by Recruit. In reply to <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON>'s questions in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Minoru </PERSON> <PERSON> Shioya </PERSON>, a telecommunications ministry official, said <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> asked the ministry to help solve trade frictions with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but gave no specific orders. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has pressed <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to buy more American supercomputers. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said a separate committee would decide whether to summon <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, who was prime minister from 1982 to 1987. Two of <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>'s secretaries were among 150 influential politicians and businessmen offered bargain stock in a Recruit subsidiary, Recruit-Cosmos, before public trading of company shares began. The stock price later soared. In arresting two Recruit officials and two <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> officials on Monday, prosecutors noted a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that non-public offers of stock expected to rise in price amounted to bribery. Two other Recruit officials were arrested Wednesday for allegedly violating securities laws. Another was arrested last year for allegedly trying to bribe an opposition member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to defuse an investigation of Recruit, an information services conglomerate. Two U.S.-made supercomputers bought by <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> were resold to Recruit but kept on <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> premises and maintained by <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> though operated by Recruit. Opposition lawmakers are questioning the terms of the arrangement. <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairwoman <PERSON> Takako </PERSON> <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> charged that sale of <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> shares was `` centered around key figures in the <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> administration'' and that <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> was involved in a supercomputer deal between <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the Japansese firms. She also said <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> personally recommended Recruit founder and former chairman <PERSON> Hiromasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON>, who was among those arrested Monday, for a spot on government committees during. Another opposition lawmaker, <PERSON> Yanosuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Narazaki </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>'s role is essential in unraveling the scandal. `` It is so clear that the scandal was centered around Mr. <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> and key members in his administration,'' <PERSON> Narazaki </PERSON> said. Ten politicians who served in <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>'s cabinet are among those linked to bargain Recruit share purchases, including <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. <PERSON> Narazaki </PERSON> said his party and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will join the <ORGANIZATION> Socialists </ORGANIZATION>, the main opposition, in demanding that <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> be summoned for questioning.

 The stock market edged upward today, extending Wednesday's rally as interest rates declined. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 22.68 points on Wednesday, rose 2.14 to 2,306.07 by 2 p.m. today on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 735 up, 596 down and 556 unchanged. The dollar rose against leading overseas currencies in early foreign-exchange trading. That helped prompt a slight increase in bond prices, and decline in interest rates, in the domestic credit markets. But buying interest in the dollar, bonds and stocks waned a bit as the session passed, apparently because of worries about the monthly report due out Friday on the country's international trade balance. Wall Street economists generally expect the figures to show about a $ 12 billion trade deficit for December, compared with the $ 12.5 billion gap between imports and exports previously reported for November. Church's Fried Chicken led the active list, up 1 -LRB- at 10 -LRB-.

<HEAD>Dollar Ends Higher in Europe, Gold Rises</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar ended higher against major foreign currencies Thursday but below its best levels in dull European trading. Gold prices rose slightly. Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar climbed to around 1.8500 West German marks after the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> announced it would not be raising its key interest rates amid expectations a rate hike would be announced. But the market lacked the energy to push the dollar through the 1.8500-mark level, and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency drifted back to its late levels. `` People have chased the dollar higher and lower a few times this week and are obviously tired of it,'' said one dealer, who said the market was awaiting the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures Friday. Dealers said trade figures released over the past few months have n't had the same impact on the market as last year. But the dollar's inability to respond to any good news this week, together with the fact that the long-awaited hike in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> discount rate has failed to materialize, may mean the trade figures will have an exaggerated impact on the dollar. Economists are expecting a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> December deficit of $ 11.7 billion, narrower than November's $ 12.5 billion gap. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost $ 1.7712 to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.7805 Wednesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday: _ 1.8425 West German marks, up from 1.8315 _ 1.5643 Swiss francs, up from 1.5565 _ 6.2725 French francs, up from 6.2425 _ 2.0790 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0680 _ 1,348.50 Italian lire, up from 1,339.50 _ 1.1859 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1800 In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.43 yen Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 126.33 yen. Gold rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 382.25 a troy ounce, compared with $ 382.00 bid late Wednesday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold was higher, closing at a bid $ 382.50 compared with $ 381.60 bid late Wednesday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose 54 cents to close at a bid $ 385.20. Silver bullion prices rose on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market where the metal was trading at a late bid price of $ 5.84 a troy ounce, compared with Wednesday's $ 5.79.

 Wheat and soybean futures prices closed sharply lower Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid a flurry of late sell orders linked to bearish supply-and-demand factors.

The report disappointed market bulls who had recently bid up wheat prices on indications that some European grain producers were running into logistical problems in meeting their sale commitments to the Soviets. `` This latest announcement about the French ... puts an end to that speculation,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. New studies showing less cold-weather damage to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> winter wheat crop than many had expected also weighed on the wheat market Reports of improved soybean-growing conditions in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> contributed to the soybean market's decline. At the close, wheat was 2 \ cents to 9 cents lower with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.23 a bushel; corn was -RCB- cent to 2 -RCB- cents lower with March at $ 2.68 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 3 \ cents to 4 \ cents lower with March at $ 2.04 \ a bushel; soybeans were 3 -LCB- cents to 10 -LCB- cents lower with March at $

 Millionaire industrialist <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>, sentenced to help the homeless instead of going to jail for tax evasion, on Thursday announced a program by one of his companies to raise money for the homeless. <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> refused to say whether the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> drive is related to his tax case, in which he was ordered to give $ 3 million to aid the homeless in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. An RC executive said the two were not connected. `` We all know this problem exists and discussing it further wo n't help to alleviate the sorrow and waste connected with this national blight, nor will it create shelter or provide food,'' <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> said, reading from a prepared statement at a news conference <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>, 69, pleaded no contest last year to evading $ 1.2 million in federal income taxes by fraudulently inflating the value of land he donated to a college in the 1970s. A federal judge fined <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> $ 4 million in fines and ordered him to give $ 3 million to help <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s homeless, with the stipulation that the money not be tax-deductible. The judge appointed a committee of civic leaders to determine how the money would be spent for the homeless in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` This is an RC campaign and has nothing to do with Mr. <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> <PERSON> Keane </PERSON>, vice president of marketing for the cola company, of which <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> is chairman. <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> said the company hopes to raise $ 1 million, and other corporations have been invited to join the effort. RC said it will donate a portion of the proceeds from sales of its soft drinks to help the homeless through local organizations. The money will come from sales in 14 markets around the country. Buyers of Royal Crown products in other markets will not be contributing to the campaign, which ends April 30. The cities involved are <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul-Minneapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>, who controls a 40-company empire valued at $ 4 billion, last September was named in a <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> civil complaint against the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which has agreed to pay a record $ 650 million to settle criminal charges of securities fraud. <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> and his son, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON>, were accused of shady dealings with now-jailed Wall Street speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> in a takeover deal.

 The stock market pieced together a modest gain today as traders awaited Friday's monthly report on the nation's international trade position The dollar rose against leading overseas currencies in early foreign-exchange trading. That helped prompt a slight increase in bond prices, and decline in interest rates, in the domestic credit markets. But buying interest in the dollar, bonds and stocks waned a bit as the session passed, apparently because of worries about the monthly trade report due out Friday. Wall Street economists generally expect the figures to show about a $ 12 billion trade deficit for December, compared with the $ 12.5 billion gap between imports and exports previously reported for November.

<HEAD>Pentagon to Raise Dollar Standard for Reporting Contracts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, citing the effects of inflation over the past decade, said Thursday it would soon raise its dollar standard for reporting contracts to the public and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Effective March 1, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said its daily listing of contract awards would be restricted to contracts worth $ 5 million or more. The current contract-reporting level is $ 3 million and was established in 1978. `` The inflation-based adjustment, up from the current $ 3 million announcement threshold, is the first to be made in almost 11 years,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Consequently, the number of contract actions requiring notification has increased significantly. As a result of inflation over the intervening years, a contract valued at $ 3 million in 1978 is now equivalent to a $ 5.6 million contract today.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said the change would have no effect on the manner in which contracts are awarded or on the number of contracts awarded. The new standard will keep manageable the contract lists printed every day for distribution to the media, public and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the Pentagon said. As is the case now, any contract awarded by a defense agency or service that falls below the threshhold will be publicly announced, but not on the day of award as happens with the larger contracts. Smaller contracts are normally disclosed after a lag of a week or so in the government publication <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> awards roughly 15 million contracts every year.

<HEAD>Wrong TV Picture Prompts Flood of Calls to Healthy S&amp;L</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIO FOX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A television news story about troubled savings and loan associations used film footage of a healthy local S & amp; L, prompting a flurry of calls from worried depositors, officials said Thursday. `` We got a flood of phone calls, at least two dozen,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, a vice president of Savings of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. CBS-owned WBBM-TV mentioned debt-ridden <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Orland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in a report on the Channel 2 News at 5 p.m. Wednesday. But the videotape footage showed Savings of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, which is on the same street in the southwest suburb. `` We told the right story and showed the wrong picture. We made a mistake and we regret it,'' <PERSON> Colleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudgeon </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> WBBM-TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> news </ORGANIZATION> director said Thursday. `` We ran a correction last night at 10 o'clock and will again at 5 today,'' she said. Not only is <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> financially healthy, its parent company, <ORGANIZATION> Irwindale </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Calif.-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, has assets of more than $ 40 billion, said <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>. Savings of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> received `` a lot of curious calls,'' said <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>. `` The report was at 5 o'clock and we were open another two hours.'' Worried callers were told there had been a mistake. `` Some heard the other name and were confused because the names are very close. We tried to allay fears, and those that needed more convincing were given appointments,'' <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> said. The S & amp; L chain then braced for a period of reassurances. `` We had to mobilize overnight. The executives of the 17 branches in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area got together by phone,'' he said. `` We wanted to address the financial information right away.'' Anxious depositors coming in Thursday were shown a video of <ORGANIZATION> WBBM </ORGANIZATION>'s retraction. They also were given the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L </ORGANIZATION>'s financial reports and copies of favorable newspaper articles _ including one in <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> that quoted a stock analyst as saying Home Savings was the best-managed thift in the nation, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Dudgeon </PERSON> would not elaborate on how <ORGANIZATION> WBBM </ORGANIZATION>'s error occurred, but said no disciplinary action was planned. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> characterized the television report as `` totally irresponsible,'' but said that `` at this point, I think no legal action is going to be necessary.'' The mix-up could even be a plus for Savings of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, he said. `` It will let us show pople how big and how strong we are,'' <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> said. Five Chicago-area savings and loan associations are on a national list of financially ailing institutions ripe for takeover by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> under President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan to resolve the crisis in the S & amp; L industry. Besides First Savings, insolvent thrifts in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area are: <ORGANIZATION> Concordia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Libertyville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; and Home Federal Savings, <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION>. All depositors at these S & amp; Ls will continue to be insured up to $ 100,000 and have normal access to their accounts, <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> officials say.

 <ORGANIZATION> LyphoMed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> won nationwide prominence a few years ago when it become the only licensed maker of a drug used to fight a deadly pneumonia linked to the AIDS scourge. Since then the company has been fighting a scourge of its own: quality complaints, product recalls and plant closures. Now <ORGANIZATION> LyphoMed </ORGANIZATION> is trying to restore customer confidence, a daunting task in a business where trust is crucial to survival. Company executives and outside analysts agree any recovery wo n't be smooth. `` The company does have a credibility gap that they have to fill with the major institutional investor _ not only explaining what happened, but that it wo n't happen again,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Harshbarger </PERSON>, an industry analyst at <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> firm that specializes in health-care investments. In 1984, <ORGANIZATION> LyphoMed </ORGANIZATION> became the only company federally licensed to make pentamidine, used to combat a pneumonia that frequently kills people afflicted with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. <ORGANIZATION> LyphoMed </ORGANIZATION>'s success seemed assured. Three years later, inspections of <ORGANIZATION> LyphoMed </ORGANIZATION> plants by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> revealed numerous violations of what the watchdog agency calls `` good manufacturing practices.'' Its <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, plant still does n't comply with <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> standards, and the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, plants have been closed permanently. But the main plant at <LOCATION> Melrose </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, is back in compliance and a new plant under construction in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> will replace the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> operation. `` The worst is behind them,'' <PERSON> Harshbarger </PERSON> said. In early February <ORGANIZATION> LyphoMed </ORGANIZATION> reported a $ 5.8 million fourth-quarter loss and a 1988 loss of $ 21.1 million, vs. a $ 21 million profit in 1987. But <PERSON> Harshbarger </PERSON> predicted 1989 `` will be a watershed year ... from investment, trade, turnaround, and operationally.'' To strengthen senior management and avoid repeating history, <ORGANIZATION> LyphoMed </ORGANIZATION> created five new positions late last year in manufacturing, quality control, research and development and regulatory affairs. With that team, <ORGANIZATION> LyphoMed </ORGANIZATION> has pledged to adding patented products to their existing business of injectible drugs for the critically ill. `` When we've come through a situation where the company has almost been frozen for a year because of the fact that we've been beset by so many problems ... it's a refreshing feeling for everybody to get going again,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Nei </PERSON>, who's leading <ORGANIZATION> LyphoMed </ORGANIZATION>'s revitalization Nei, 44, a veteran health-care industry executive who formerly worked at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, was hired in the fall for the newly created position of president and chief operating officer. His job, <ORGANIZATION> Nei </ORGANIZATION> said, is to `` bring a more disciplined and controlled environment to the corporation and, one at a time, begin to set aside the things that have plagued the company.'' The first challenge is restoring customer confidence and sales, which plunged by about 50 percent last year. <ORGANIZATION> LyphoMed </ORGANIZATION> officials decline to say how many clients have taken their business elsewhere, but <ORGANIZATION> Nei </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged in a recent interview that the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> scrutiny `` certainly led to a significant disappointment on the part of a lot of pharmacists. `` But the fact is,'' he said, `` the company grew at -LRB- such -RRB- a rate ... that we were unable to provide the necessary people and systems to control our quality systems in the face of that growth.'' Annual sales totaled $ 4 million in 1981, when <ORGANIZATION> LyphoMed </ORGANIZATION> was acquired from <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Container </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in a management-led takeover by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kapoor </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer. In 1987 sales totaled $ 172 million, reflecting <ORGANIZATION> LyphoMed </ORGANIZATION>'s success in selling drugs to large hospitals at attractive prices. The surge laid the foundation for trouble. Among the main problems were these: _ An <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> inspection report in July 1987 on the firm's Melrose Park plant that cited improper drug-testing procedures and inadequate employee training or supervision _ A November 1987 <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> letter that cited `` serious violations'' of federal law, including release of under-filled vials of drugs and failure to follow up on indications of contamination of several drugs, including pentamidine _ A November 1987 <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> suspension of <ORGANIZATION> LyphoMed </ORGANIZATION>'s applications to market new drugs until quality-control problems were corrected _ A January 1988 company recall of amphotericin B, an antibiotic used on fungal infections, after patient complaints of high fever and chills _ A March 1988 <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> report on a three-month inspection at the Melrose Park plant that listed 44 violations of `` good manufacturing practices,'' similar to problems disclosed in the November 1987 letter _ A June 1988 suspension of <ORGANIZATION> LyphoMed </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> plant operations to correct quality-control problems found by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Finally this past September under <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> orders, <ORGANIZATION> LyphoMed </ORGANIZATION> agreed to destroy or clean up hundreds of thousands of contaminated injectable drugs seized by federal authorities. It also agreed to recall some drugs that were distributed, including heparin, ascorbic acid and potassium chloride, which is commonly given to hospitalized patients with congestive heart failure. `` The firm had bad problems,'' said an <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> official who requested anonymity. `` Out of the 100 violations we dealt with in fiscal 1987 ... <ORGANIZATION> LyphoMed </ORGANIZATION>'s were among the most serious ... but it was not unique.'' Important clients spooked off by <ORGANIZATION> LyphoMed </ORGANIZATION>'s travails included <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consortium </ORGANIZATION>, a pharmaceutical-buying group for 48 university hospitals nationwide. The group disapproved <ORGANIZATION> LyphoMed </ORGANIZATION> as a vendor about a year ago, and its pharmacy advisory committee voted in December `` not to reinstate <ORGANIZATION> LyphoMed </ORGANIZATION> as an approved vendor through 1989,'' said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Packard </PERSON>, vice president of planning and marketing for the <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terrace </ORGANIZATION>, Ill.-based consortium. `` We were not convinced that <ORGANIZATION> LyphoMed </ORGANIZATION> could be a consistent supplier of products'' of assured quality, she said in a phone interview. But she said the consortium may restore its relationship with <ORGANIZATION> LyphoMed </ORGANIZATION> eventually. `` We would like to have them be reapproved because they provide a product that is not readily available,'' she said, referring to pentamidine. <ORGANIZATION> Nei </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> LyphoMed </ORGANIZATION> is trying to convey the message that the company has reformed, and `` we're certainly sorry over some of the inconvenience that we've caused some of our customers.''

The government says debt payments this year will total between $ 12 billion and $ 14 billion. `` The country can not go on being an exporter of capital to the rich countries,'' <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> said. `` We have normalized our accounts with international creditors, but the total of the debt and its respective servicing still constitute a serious restriction to our economy's development.'' <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> does n't have enough money in its reserves to pay $ 1.3 billion due in March to commercial banks and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. He called a recent agreement to reschedule debt payments `` a step forward,'' but added that it `` can not be considered a definitive solution.'' The $ 82 billion agreement calls for the rescheduling over 20 years of debt due between 1987 and 1993, lower interest rates and $ 5.2 billion in new loans. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> has insisted that new ideas are needed to reduce the Latin American debt, estimated at more than $ 400 billion. `` It is fundamental to insist on the political responsibility of the industrialized countries for the creation of institutional mechanisms that permit a quick and definitive lowering of the debt,'' <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> said. The debt will be on the agenda of a private meeting between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> when the presidents attend the funeral of Japanese Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> this month, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> also will meet with <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Noburo </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> to discuss the release of $ 600 million in credits by the Japanese government, according to the ministry. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> is counting on the Japanese loan, plus $ 500 million from the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and $ 600 million from commercial banks to meet its debt obligations this year. The <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> has warned that <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> could again suspend debt payments _ as it did in 1987 _ if its cash reserves fall too low. However, the level of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s reserves depends largely on the success of a radical anti-inflation plan announced last month. The plan aimed at curbing 1,000 percent inflation includes a freeze on wages and prices and sharp cuts in government spending. On Wednesday night, <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> went on nationwide television and radio and said the plan was working, despite growing signs of labor unrest. He said `` the specter of hyperinflation has been halted and price increases in February will be minimal.'' However, the president warned that `` a mania for striking'' could bring instability to the 4-year-old civilian regime. Until 1985, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> was ruled for 21 years by a right-wing military government. Labor unions have called for a national strike on March 14 and 15 to protest the end of cost-of-living raises under the anti-inflation plan.

<HEAD>Ford Profit Up 24.4 Percent In Quarter, 14.5 Percent In Record Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday posted a 24.4 percent rise in its fourth quarter earnings and record annual profits, as results in its overseas business overshadowed a decline in its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automotive earnings. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> reported a fourth quarter profit of $ 1.16 billion, or $ 2.42 a share, compared with $ 932 million, or $ 1.87 a share, in the same period of 1987. Revenue during the quarter rose to $ 23.91 billion from $ 20.99 billion a year earlier. Annual profits rose to an industry-record $ 5.3 billion, or $ 10.96 a share, on revenue of $ 92.45 billion. In 1987, the nation's No. 2 automaker made $ 4.63 billion, or $ 9.05 a share, on revenue of $ 79.9 billion. `` We're particularly pleased with our overseas performance and with our <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> car market share,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McCammon </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for finance and treasurer. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automobile market climbed to 21.7 percent in 1988, its highest in 10 years and up 1.7 points from 1987. During the year, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> slipped 9.1 percent to $ 2.5 billion from $ 2.75 billion in 1987, while overseas profits rose to $ 2.1 billion from 1987's $ 1 billion. <PERSON> McCammon </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> profits partly declined because of a lopsided mix of vehicles the company had available, mainly caused by lower-than-anticipated production of Thunderbird and Cougar cars. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> also blamed higher marketing costs, including sales incentives, and increased factory costs. Profits in <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s financial operations, including its lending business, fell 19.4 percent in 1988 from 1987, the automaker also reported. The sag in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> performance means <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s workers wo n't receive as much in their profit-sharing checks this year as they did last year, when a typical employee got $ 3,700. <PERSON> McCammon </PERSON> said profit-sharing figures would be announced Friday to <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> employees via closed-circuit television, and would be the second-highest in company history. That means the checks will be less than last year's but more than the $ 2,100 each worker received in 1986. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which reported its earnings Tuesday, said it would issue profit-sharing checks of about $ 254 to each employee. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said earlier this month its workers would receive about $ 720 apiece. Together, the Big Three reported 1988 earnings of $ 11.21 billion, topping the previous annual profit record of $ 9.79 billion in 1984. But analyst <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said the Big Three's earnings were boosted by inflation and accounting changes. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> McCammon </PERSON> said the cost of sales incentives, used to lure customers into showrooms, rose by about $ 400 million in 1988 over 1987, but he declined to say how much the company spent on incentives. <PERSON> McCammon </PERSON> said and decline in <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s financial operations profits stemmed from a shrinking margin between the rate at which <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> loaned money and the rate at which it borrows and partly because of an increasing number of bad loans. A trend toward longer car loans, up to five years, tends to increase odds of the loan turning sour, he said. About half of the loans that <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> handles are for five years. <PERSON> McCammon </PERSON> also said no further financial acquisitions are anticipated for <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationwide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-based </LOCATION> savings and loan institution wholly-owned by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> McCammon </PERSON> said that with $ 9.2 billion in cash available, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> still was looking for some kind of acquisition.

 Church's <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, running out of time and courtroom manuevers to prevent a takeover by <ORGANIZATION> Popeyes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Famous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION> and Biscuits, has agreed to be bought by its rival for about $ 330 million. Church's, the nation's second-largest fried chicken restaurant chain and Popeyes, the No. 3 chain, agreed late Wednesday on a buyout, ending a four-month dispute that saw Church's take Popeyes to court, sell 120 unprofitable restaurants and put itself up for auction to avoid the hostile takeover. The agreement calls for Popeyes owner <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> to purchase up to 30.1 million shares, or about 86.5 percent of Church's outstanding shares, for $ 11 per share Each share of Church's stock not purchased in the tender offer will be converted to 0.44 share of a new series of preferred stock to be issued by the corporation that survives the merger. The statement did not say what the new company would be called. Church's stock closed at $ 10.25 in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading Thursday, up $ 1.25 a share. Popeyes previously had offered about $ 290 million to take over the ailing <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, whose sales have been declining over the past three years. The companies said the agreement, reached four days before Popeyes' tender offer deadline, came about amicably. `` I am pleased that we have agreed to this merger and believe it will create a very strong No. 2 fast food fried chicken chain,'' Church's president and chief executive officer <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Renaud </PERSON> said in a statement. The companies' statement said that <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> has offered to provide up to $ 300 million and <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has offered up to $ 178 million in financing for the tender offer. Neither <PERSON> Renaud </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> immediately returned telephone messages Thursday to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. It was not known how many jobs might be lost as a result of the merger. In documents submitted to a federal court during the takeover process, <PERSON> Popeyes </PERSON> said that if it acquired <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s it would close 250 Church's restaurants, keep 92 with the Church's name, rename 303 others as Popeyes and sell 440 others for about $ 160 million over the next four years. Popeyes, with 703 restaurants, had been attempting since November to take over <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, a publicly held company with 1,478 restaurants. Even with a merger, the new company would lag behind No. 1. <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION>, which is owned by <ORGANIZATION> PepsiCo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and which has annual sales of about $ 4 billion in its 7,000 restaurants. Church's, founded in 1952 by <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sr. </ORGANIZATION>, had grown steadily over the years, but internal bickering, including a leveraged buyout attempt, and other management and marketing problems the last several years began taking its toll on the company. Church's sales have gone down steadily, from $ 639 million in fiscal year 1985 to $ 577 in 1986 and $ 533 in 1987. Popeyes, meanwhile, started by <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> 15 years ago, is expected to have sales about $ 480 million this year. During the takeover attempt, Church's sued Popeyes, arguing that former <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s executives working for <PERSON> Popeyes </PERSON> took with them information that was used in the buyout proposal. Church's also adopted a `` poison pill'' takeover defense that would make it more difficult to carry out a hostile takeover. Federal judges in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> had sided with Popeyes.

 Stock prices nudged ahead Thursday as traders awaited the monthly report Friday on the nation's international trade position. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.50 to 2,311.43, on top of a 22.68-point gain Wednesday. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 816 up, 591 down and 553 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 177.45 million shares, up from 154.22 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 207.84 million shares. The dollar rose against leading overseas currencies in early foreign-exchange trading. That helped prompt a slight increase in bond prices, and decline in interest rates, in the domestic credit markets. But buying interest in the dollar, bonds and stocks waned a bit as the session passed, apparently because of worries about the monthly trade report due out Friday. Wall Street economists generally expect the figures to show about a $ 12 billion trade deficit for December, compared with the $ 12.5 billion gap between imports and exports previously reported for November. Church's Fried Chicken climbed 1 \ to 10 \ in active The company agreed to be acquired by <ORGANIZATION> A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Copeland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> for $ 11 a share in cash and securities. <ORGANIZATION> Merck </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 to 64 -RCB- following word that researchers at the company have found what they describe as a promising approach toward combating the virus that causes AIDS.

<HEAD>Talk of Mexican Buying Propels Sugar Futures To Year's High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Sugar futures prices rocketed to new 1989 highs Thursday on rumors that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, historically a net exporter of sugar, had purchased 400,000 tons of refined white sugar on world markets because of a domestic shortage. The Mexican government later denied the rumors, which had triggered massive buying of sugar futures on both <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Futures and <ORGANIZATION> Options </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. On other markets, grain and soybean prices tumbled over concern that supply exceeded demand; livestock and meat were mixed; energy futures gained; and precious metals retreated. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> sugar futures settled .39 cent to .49 cent higher with the contract for delivery in March at 10.97 cents a pound, it's highest settlement price since Dec. 30 March sugar traded as high as 11 cents a pound during the session. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> had been rumored earlier in the week to have purchased 75,000 metric tons of sugar from the French trade house Sucres et Denrees. Even so, Thursday's reports of larger-scale buying took traders by surprise. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the rumors incited heavy buying of sugar contracts by futures speculators. Trading volume in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> soared to 40,000 contracts, compared with about 30,000 on Wednesday and 23,000 on Tuesday. Analysts said <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> may have overextended itself on export commitments and needed to replenish supplies for its own use. Wheat led the late decline in grain and soybean futures on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, with much of the selling based on news that a sale of 1.5 million metric tons of <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> wheat to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was expected to proceed smoothly. The report disappointed market participants who had recently bid up wheat prices on indications that some European grain producers were running into logistical problems in meeting their sale commitments to the Soviets. Wheat settled 2 -RCB- cents to 9 cents lower with March at $ 4.22 -LCB- a bushel; corn was -RCB- cent to 2 -RCB- cents lower with March at $ 2.69 a bushel; oats were 3 \ cents to 4 \ cents lower with March at $ 2.04 \ a bushel; soybeans were 3 -LCB- cents to 11 \ cents lower with March at $ Livestock and meat futures ended mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in cautious trading ahead of an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report on the number of cattle on feedlots in the seven largest cattle-producing states. The report, issued after the close, showed 7.7 million head of cattle on feed as of Feb. 1, a 2 percent reduction from a year ago. The report also showed a 5 percent decline in marketings of cattle off of feedlots last month and a 3 percent increase in the number of cattle placed on feedlots during January. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> figures were all within the trade's expectations, so analysts said the report would have little impact on livestock futures prices on Friday. Live cattle settled unchanged to .33 cent higher with April at 75.47 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .10 cent higher with March at 81.72 cents a pound; hogs were .12 cent lower to .08 cent higher with April at 41.97 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.40 cents lower to .58 cent higher with March at 37.90 cents a pound. Energy futures finished higher in a day of seesaw trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 8 cents to 30 cents higher with March at $ 18.33 a barrel; heating oil was unchanged to .91 cent higher with March at 49.65 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .24 cent to 1.10 cents higher with March at 49.05 cents a gallon. Gold and silver futures slipped lower in dull trading on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Gold settled $ 1 to $ 1.10 lower with April at $ 387.10 a troy ounce; silver settled 1 cent to 1.1 cents lower with March at $ 5.895 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Legal Mistake Hampers Patent Claim Against Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An apparent oversight in drafting a legal settlement could cost <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> $ 270 million in potential damage payments from the federal government in a long-running patent infringement suit, a published report said Thursday. The error was identified in a ruling by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Claims Court Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, who said <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' lawyers made a mistake in a 1987 out-of-court settlement in a related patent case. The ruling, issued Sept. 29, was published recently in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Patent Quarterly. It was first reported in the general news media Thursday in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times. The case involves an 18-year-long patent infringement case pursued by <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, now a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, involving a device used to control orbiting satellites. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> maintains the device made the modern communications satellite network possible and claims the government used the device on 108 satellites without paying royalties. In the case, which presently is in the penalty-setting phase, <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> seeks $ 3.16 billion in damages, based on 15 percent royalties plus compensation for delay in payment. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s ruling released the government from liability connected with 13 government satellites built by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> which <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> sued for infringement of the same patent. The ruling was based on wording of a September 1987 settlement of the <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> suit against <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> that absolves <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> customers from further liability, the Times said. The government was a Ford customer. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> could have prevented the exclusion of the 13 satellites from the total by adding `` except the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' after the wording releasing <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> customers from liability. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay Hughes $ 75 million in the 1987 settlement, the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said, quoting unidentified sources. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, managing partner at <ORGANIZATION> Latham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, the law firm representing <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> in the case, denied the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> firm erred in drafting the settlement. `` Everything I know is that we did n't make a mistake at all in the case,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> officials refused to comment because the matter concerned litigation, according to <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, a spokesman at the company's corporate headquarters, said Thursday The company has asked the judge to reconsider the ruling. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> values its royalties and penalties on the 13 satellites in the disputed ruling at $ 270 million, but the government puts the potential payment to the company at $ 50 million, the Times reported, citing secret court filings. The patented device was invented in the early 1960s by <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a Hughes engineer. The device allows a single small rocket motor to control the orbit of a spinning satellite by employing gyroscopic principles. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> claims the invention made possible the creation of practical communicatins satellites, today a multibillion-dollar industry. The government contends <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> has overblown its claims and that it does n't possess a valid patent. In two previous stages of the case, federal courts have held the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles-based </LOCATION> aerospace company has a valid claim to a patent on the device and that the government infringed on that patent. The present phase is to set the penalty against the government.

 A bankruptcy court judge Thursday delayed a decision on whether to allow an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> liquidator to sell 4,700 of <ORGANIZATION> Yugo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s unsold cars, nearly a third of the stock of the bankrupt Yugoslav carmaker. <ORGANIZATION> Impex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Car </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the American agent for <ORGANIZATION> Yugo </ORGANIZATION>, and the liquidator, <ORGANIZATION> Norauto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, battled this week over control of the autos. <PERSON> Yugo </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Impex </ORGANIZATION> argue that a deal last fall with <PERSON> Norauto </PERSON> represented a financing arrangement to bail out the financially ailing company. <PERSON> Norauto </PERSON> insists it bought the cars outright and should be allowed to sell them. Company officials claim that unloading the autos at below-wholesale prices without warranties would destroy the market for Yugos. <LOCATION> Yugo </LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Saddle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, on Jan. 30 filed for protection under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Court Judge <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Commisa </PERSON> has temporarily barred the sale of the cars. He said he would rule next week on whether the ban should continue after boths sides present further court papers. The prospects of reorganizing <PERSON> Yugo </PERSON> would be `` very likely eliminated'' if the restraint was lifted, <ORGANIZATION> Impex </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baime </PERSON> said in final remarks Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Yugo </ORGANIZATION>'s acting chief executive, <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kole </PERSON>, testified that Norauto extended credit to <LOCATION> Yugo </LOCATION> with the cars as collateral and granted <ORGANIZATION> Yugo </ORGANIZATION> a buyback option. Norauto attorney <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheider </PERSON> argued the deal also was between the liquidator and the car's manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION> Zavodi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crevna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zastava </ORGANIZATION>, which was called the `` seller'' in the contract for the cars. The 4,700 autos in question are among 6,000 Yugos at American ports. <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has a lien on the other cars. <ORGANIZATION> Yugo </ORGANIZATION>'s 260 dealers nationwide have about 9,500 cars.

 <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to buy up to 30 commerical aircraft from <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION>, a European consortium, in an estimated $ 3 billion deal, <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> officials said Thursday. The order gives another boost to the commercial jet industry. Earlier this month, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> signed a 142-plane, estimated $ 7 billion deal with <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> plans to use the new plans to replace uts fleet of DC10-30 aircraft, enabling the airline to offer most nonstop routes from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> said The contract, signed Wednesday, calls for <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> to buy 15 Airbus A340 aircraft for delivery between September 1992 and March 1994. <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> will receive both A4340-200s, which seat 222 passengers, and A340-300s, which have 256-seat cabins. Both versions are powered by <ORGANIZATION> CFM </ORGANIZATION> International CFM56-5C-2 engines. According to the contract, <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> will decide later on whether to purchase 15 more planes. With the <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> order, <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> now has firm orders, options and commitments for 110 A340 aircraft, the consortium said. Last year, $ 48.5 billion in new planes were ordered, the highest total ever. Industry officials estimate that the demand to replace aging aircraft could push annual sales to $ 450 billion by the year 2005.

 The dollar dipped against several major currencies but rose against the British pound and Canadian dollar on Thursday in advance of Friday's release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures. Most economists were expecting the merchandise trade deficit for December to be slightly below the November figure of $ 12.5 billion. Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar climbed to around 1.85 West German marks after the West German central bank announced it would not be raising its key interest rates, following expectations a rate hike would be announced. The rally failed to last. `` People have chased the dollar higher and lower a few times this week and are obviously tired of it,'' one dealer in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> said. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound fell to $ 1.7712 from $ 1.7805 late Wednesday. Later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, sterling fell to $ 1.7720 from $ 1.7743 late Wednesday. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.43 yen to a closing 126.33 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar was quoted at 126.33 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar edged down to 126.11 yen from 126.13 yen late Wednesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.8388 West German marks, down from 1.8405; 1.5601 Swiss francs, down from 1.5623; 1.1867 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1796; 6.2600 French francs, down from 6.2658; and 1,344.3 Italian lire, down from 1,349.00. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday, included: 1.8425 West German marks, up from 1.8315; 1.5643 Swiss francs, up from 1.5565; 6.2725 French francs, up from 6.2425; 2.0790 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0680; 1,348.50 Italian lire, up from 1,339.50; and 1.1859 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1800. Gold rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid of $ 382.25 a troy ounce, compared with $ 382.00 bid late Wednesday.

 Crude oil futures prices rose on Thursday, buoyed by a combination of reports that included news of temporary shutdowns of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil platforms. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the March contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, rose 8 cents to settle at $ 18.33 a barrel. The contract jumped 83 cents in the previous session. Other contract months had slightly higher gains. Among refined oil products, the March contract for heating oil rose 0.91 cent to 49.65 cents a gallon. The gains were triggered by a report that <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s national oil company was experiencing cargo loading problems, said <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothenberg </PERSON>, an oil broker with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Unleaded gasoline for March delivery rose 0.28 cent to close at 49.05 cents a gallon. Crude oil prices had hovered in the $ 17 range for several weeks, but surged Wednesday as investors anticipated a positive outcome from next week's meeting of non-OPEC oil producers. Thursday's rally began after a report of a temporary production disruption at two of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stratfjord </LOCATION> oilfield platforms. A report that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> had cut March contract volumes to its <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> customers by 15 percent triggered more buying later in the day, <PERSON> Rothenberg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nauman </PERSON> <PERSON> Barakat </PERSON>, an international energy analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said investors are remaining optimistic ahead of next week's meeting of non-OPEC producers in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.

 The narrowest measure of the nation's money supply, M1, rose $ 700 million in the week ended Feb. 6, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said M1 rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 787.4 billion from a revised $ 786.7 billion the previous week. The broader money supply measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,068.9 billion from $ 3,071.3 billion. An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,921.0 billion from $ 3,920.1 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In judging its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> last year set a provisional target for 1989 of 3 percent to 7 percent growth in M2 and 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent growth in M3. <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> is scheduled to announce new targets in late February. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has not set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' Machinists union has engaged in `` economic warfare'' by staging a two-day wildcat strike, illegal slowdowns and sickouts since contract talks broke off early this month, the carrier charged in federal court Thursday. Eastern claimed in response to union criticism that management has acted solely within the legal bounds of a federally imposed, 30-day cooling-off period after the breakdown of 16 months of contract talks. Eastern's allegations were contained in a five-page response _ plus 50 pages of related documents _ delivered to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> has ordered the airline to respond to the militant union's motion for a temporary restraining order to block Eastern management from hiring non-union workers to perform tasks traditionally handled by organized labor The <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union represents <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s 8,500 machinists, baggage handlers and ground personnel who have been working without a contract for the past 13 months. <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> scheduled a hearing on the union request for late Friday morning. The hearing will come at the end of a week that saw an overwhelming 97.3 percent of Machinists members vote nationwide to authorize a strike if no agreement is reached by midnight March 3 _ the end of the cooling-off period. The Miami-based airline will be free to impose its own work rules and the union is free to strike legally at that time. `` Eastern's response to the wildcat strike and ongoing slowdown has been measured and consistent with its Railway Labor Act contractual obligations,'' the airline's court documents said. The wildcat walkouts `` were overt acts of economic warfare and tended to further the bargaining goals'' of the union, they said. The airline charged that a work slowdown has grounded 17 of the carrier's jetliners, which the document says amounts to `` almost 10 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s scheduled fleet.'' A company attorney said Wednesday that 19 planes were grounded. The airline said the planes were awaiting scheduled checks that could not be completed due to a work slowdown by Machinists. Union leader <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> dismissed management's slowdown charges Wednesday, recalling <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s recent performance _ advertised as the No. 1 on-time operator in the industry. `` How could that possibly be going on if our people are slowing down?'' he asked. Another passage in Eastern's response appeared likely to evoke grim agreement from both sides in the dispute. Eastern stated that the situation at the financially strapped airline `` promises to get much worse unless remedial action is taken promptly.'' The airline said `` even the present backlog of grounded aircraft is totally unacceptable and poses a severe threat to a company in <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s dire financial condition.'' The airline is currently losing about $ 1 million a day and has suffered losses estimated at $ 335.4 million for 1988.

<TEXT>
 The government is scheduled to close the books Friday on the first annual improvement in the trade deficit since 1980, but the deficit has leveled off in recent months and many economists say it will get worse again. The financial markets' mild reaction to the recent trend could reflect a view that with inflation the big concern, a widening deficit is not of primary concern. American industry, already running near full tilt, may not be able to produce a big increase in exports or substitute for imports without overheating and leading to higher inflation, some economists say. When the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported last month that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit widened to $ 12.51 billion in November, a 22 percent jump from October's $ 10.26 billion, the financial markets brushed it off, surprising many analysts. Friday's report is expected to show the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade gap narrowed to around $ 137 billion for 1988, a sharp improvement over the record $ 170.3 billion in 1987. The last time the deficit narrowed was during President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s last year in office It widened during each year of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s administration. Until recent months, poor trade reports induced currency dealers to dump dollars out of fear that the dollar would need to decline to make American-made goods competitive in world markets. But after the surprisingly bad November report heavy buying pushed the dollar higher, spurring a rise in stocks and bonds. Analysts, at a loss to explain the market reaction fully, attributed it largely to technical factors. Reaction by the fickle financial markets to Friday's report is unpredictable. Many economists believe December's deficit shrank slightly from November. Some economists believe that the kind of strong growth in exports that would be needed to shrink the deficit would be inflationary because <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> industry is already running close to full capacity. Reduction in the budget deficit would give the economy some slack, giving more room for the manufacturing sector to pick up speed, some economists say. `` We should ask if we need an improvement in the trade balance before we lower the budget deficit,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, senior fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` In the context of the overall economy I guess you can say it's not so bad that the trade deficit has n't improved,'' he said The dollar has been supported lately by high <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates, which make dollar-denominated securities attractive. At the same time, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and other central banks have stepped in to prop the dollar up whenever it went into a steep slide. Both those factors have made the markets pay less attention to unfavorable trade numbers. `` What -LRB- the markets -RRB- are saying is that if the trade numbers are adverse they can count on the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to take remedial action. So it makes them less uncomfortable,'' said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, senior economist with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. One economist who is concerned about the trade deficit, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the first annual decline in the trade deficit in eight years obscures the recent negative `` If you look at the annual decline you get a picture of progress, but that just reflects the first half. The second half does n't reflect progress,'' he said. More significant than the growth in imports, <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> believes, is the slowdown in the export growth rate, with no clear evidence that is has bottomed out. The <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said there are signs that the inaugural euphoria is wearing off and that the financial markets might be more inclined to take the trade numbers seriously this time around. `` I see more of a chance that the dollar would take it if we see a surprisingly large widening of the deficit,'' <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said. `` But if we see big trade numbers and nothing happens, I guess we can expect that, too.''

<TEXT>
 Spending is down, unemployment and bankruptcies are up, and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s oil-based economy is still recovering from the morning-after effects of a 15-year binge, the head of the central bank said Thursday. Tough government measures last year made headway in limiting wages, trimming inflation and swinging foreign trade into the black, said <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norway </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Hermod </PERSON> <PERSON> Skaanland </PERSON>. `` There are no easy solutions to the problems we are facing. Fifteen years of speculation, oil boom and an ever-increasing standard of living have put us where we are today,'' said <PERSON> Skaanland </PERSON>. Skaanland's address to the bank's steering committee coincided with the publication of the 1988 balance sheet, which showed an increase of 27.4 percent to 7.9 billion kronor, or about $ 1.18 billion. The bank transferred $ 1.12 billion to the state treasury. <PERSON> Skaanland </PERSON> said the end was near for <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s era of petroleum wealth, which began with the 1969 discovery of oil off its <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> coast. Production in 1989 is expected to average 1.44 million barrels per day. `` We are already approaching the peak in our oil production,'' he said. `` It will continue to increase for a few more years and then begin to taper off in the late 1990s.'' <PERSON> Skaanland </PERSON> urged the Labor government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Gro </PERSON> <PERSON> Harlem </PERSON> <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> to continue the belt-tightening measures started after oil prices collapsed in 1986. `` Last year, most of us began to feel the direct effect of -LRB- <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s -RRB- new economic reality. The feeling of job security is lower than at any time since World War II,'' he said. Unemployment doubled last year to 4 percent of the work force, the highest rate since the 1930s. During 1988, 3,494 companies filed bankruptcy petitions, up 81 percent over 1987. Many of them were forced out of business by high interest rates and a drop in private consumption by 1.6 percent. He urged the government to continue keeping the lid on wages to help <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> regain its international competitiveness. A wage limit last year helped bring inflation down to 5.6 percent from 7 percent in 1987. Foreign trade scored a 1988 surplus of $ 618 million. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s 1988 banking crisis cost banks more than $ 1.04 billion in losses on loans, according to official estimates. <PERSON> Skaanland </PERSON> said these losses were due to `` bad banking, bad policies and bad luck.'' `` Even if banks show significant losses in 1989 as well, we expect net results to show an improvement,'' he said.

<HEAD>Valley Lemons Hurt Worst, Scattered Orange Damage</HEAD>

 Last week's deep freeze could have walloped <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s citrus groves, but officials said Thursday a blend of hard work, timing and good luck spared the crop from a devastating loss. `` It would have been a disaster and it just did n't develop,'' said <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, vice president of agricultural affairs for Dole Citrus. `` Overall, we're just not seeing it.'' Growers said it was still too early to provide a full damage report from the record-breaking cold weather which brought snow to <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION> and left icicles clinging to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> oranges. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> navel orange crop was damaged but did not suffer a major internal freeze as some growers had feared. Orange rinds were scarred by ice, which means fruit will be downgraded in packing sheds and command a lower price, those interviewed said. Valley lemons were hurt the worst, with estimates ranging from 20 to 50 percent of the existing crop lost to the freeze, officials said. But <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> lemons total only 10 percent of the <LOCATION> California-Arizona </LOCATION> crop, and about half the valley lemons had been picked and stored before the freeze, said <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Sunkist </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Van </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nuys </LOCATION>. `` We do n't see it as enough to be that concerned,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. Southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s citrus groves largely escaped freeze damage because <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> winds kept the cold temperatures from damaging the crop, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. But those winds scarred fruit and knocked some of it to the ground. Citrus is damaged when the mercury remains at 26 degrees or lower for four hours or more. In one part of <LOCATION> Tulare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which boasts a $ 357 million citrus crop, temperatures last week stayed at 23 degrees for 8 -LCB- hours. A sudden burst of warm weather still could harm the oranges by frost causing frost-tinged fruit to swell with liquid and drop from the frozen stems, officials warned. `` Growers throughout the valley got hit. It was a democratic freeze,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, president of Visalia-based <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 800 growers who raise 50,000 acres of citrus trees. But there was room for optimism regarding the <LOCATION> Valencia </LOCATION> orange crop which has three months to recover from the frost's bite before harvest. `` I do n't think consumers will see a large cost increase,'' said <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, reflecting the view of several industry officials. `` I'd be very surprised if they see a major increase at the retail level.'' Wholesale orange prices generally have increased $ 1.50 to $ 2 a box in the last week due to the freeze, and retail prices have gone up 20 cents a pound in some outlets, said <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosales </PERSON>, a buyer for OK Produce in <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>. Before the freeze, a 40-pound box of medium-sized oranges cost $ 6.50. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Burchett </PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tulare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, predicted frost damaged 10 percent to 15 percent of the navel crop, which is in harvest now. Growers credit the crop's apparent survival to a number of factors, said <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> of <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. Farmers ran warm water in groves, burned fuel oil and cranked up giant fans to raise the temperature around the trees. The cold weather came later than usual, which is good news since the crop contained a higher sugar content and that acted much like anti-freeze, <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the majority owner of <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday its earnings shot up in the fourth quarter because of a one-time gain from operations it sold. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> also said <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>'s results improved sharply in the quarter. The nation's third-biggest long-distance company had its first positive operating income except for a one-time charge for restructuring, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> assumed management control of <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> Sprint in July 1988 and purchased controlling interest from its former 50-50 partner, <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, on Jan. 3 of this year. `` This has been a year of extaordinary change and outstanding progress for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION>, a year in which we started to realized the positive results of our long-term strategy,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Esrey </PERSON>, the president, said in a statement. The company said it earned $ 379.5 million, or $ 3.70 a share, in the quarter, up from $ 29.1 million, or 29 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue jumped to $ 1.73 billion from $ 780 million. <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> Sprint's revenue was not included in the year-earlier period. The bulk of the quarterly profit came from an after-tax gain of $ 369 million, which was mainly from the sale of the company's cellular and paging operations That gain wsa partially offset by an after-tax loss of $ 64 million charge consisting of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION>'s share of a restructuring charge at <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> For all of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> said net income improved to a record $ 508.9 million, or $ 4.95 a share, from a loss of $ 51.5 million the previous year. In 1988, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> had consolidated net revenues of $ 6.5 billion, compared with $ 2.9 billion in 1987 when <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>'s revenues of $ 2.7 billion were not included. <PERSON> Esrey </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> had long-distance revenue of $ 3.4 billion in 1988, up 27 percent from $ 2.67 billion the year before.

<TEXT>
 Soft drink giants <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> each claimed Thursday they had been vindicated by the television networks in their latest advertising spat. <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> said it agreed to make what it called `` two minor alterations'' in its new ads that claim a `` move is on'' from regular <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> to Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>. The Atlanta-based company said the revised campaign would continue to air on network television. `` Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> wins again,'' the company said. But <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION>, which had complained to the networks that the Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> spot was false and misleading, said the requested alterations represented `` fundamental changes.'' `` They called a foul against <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> ... We are overjoyed,'' said <PERSON> Tod </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKenzie </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Somers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>. At the same time, <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> said it had voluntarily withdrawn its ad that poked fun at how <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> came up with its claims, showing executives poring over soft drink statistics while wearing distorting 3D glasses <PERSON> MacKenzie </PERSON> said its ad was aired only as an interim measure while the networks reviewed its complaint abot the Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> ads. In the original series of ads launched in late January, <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> took the unusual step of positioning Diet Coke against the sugared version of <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>. `` Last year, nearly two million families stopped buying <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> and more of them moved to Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> than any other major soft drink,'' the Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> ads said. After a review by the networks, <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> said it agreed to change the second part of its claim to say, `` ... and about a half million of them moved to Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> also agreed to indicate on the screen the name of the research company that came up with the data supporting its claim and note that it includes both Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> and caffeine-free Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>.
