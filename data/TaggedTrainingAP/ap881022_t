 A judge has ordered a man facing his fifth drunken-driving charge to undergo acupuncture in an attempt to overcome a drinking problem that his lawyer says has resisted conventional treatment. `` I'm not sure if acupuncture works, but it's obvious nothing else works with you,'' <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> told <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, 31. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> issued the order Thursday at the request of Public Defender <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacklen </PERSON>, a defense attorney who believes acupuncture can play a valuable role in fighting substance abuse. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> also ordered Ball to use <PERSON> Anabuse </PERSON>, a drug that reacts violently with alcohol in a person's body, to ensure that he does no more drinking. `` By ordering -LRB- acupuncture -RRB-, I'm not advocating it as a cure,'' <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said later. `` It ca n't hurt, right?'' Prosecutors Thursday charged <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> with driving under the influence, reckless driving, two counts of hit-and-run, and driving without a valid license.

 For most political candidates, it usually goes without saying that they think they could do a better job than their opponents. Not so in a state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Debish </PERSON>, 20, of <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON> says he would n't mind voting for <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> incumbent <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunther </PERSON> on Nov. 8. Debish is the Democrat challenging <PERSON> Gunther </PERSON>. `` -LRB- <PERSON> Gunther </PERSON> -RRB- would probably do a better job, be more effective in the next two years because of his long standing in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Debish </PERSON> said earlier this week. `` Most of the things I see in the newspaper that he stands for, I agree with.'' Debish, a sophomore at <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in nearby <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, gives himself a very slim chance of defeating the 11-term incumbent. `` I just do n't want to upset anybody,'' <PERSON> Debish </PERSON> said. `` He's doing his job. Many challengers demand face-to-face confrontations in debates, but a few weeks ago <PERSON> Debish </PERSON> declined to meet <PERSON> Gunther </PERSON> in a debate. `` We decided he has so much experience, he would probably just kill me,'' <PERSON> Debish </PERSON> said. `` He's just an old pro.

Almost anyone who goes up against him would probably lose,'' he said. <PERSON> Debish </PERSON> said he wanted to get some experience running for office and has his sights set on something other than the Legislature. `` I want to be mayor of <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON> someday,'' he said. Despite <PERSON> Debish </PERSON>'s deference to the incumbent, <PERSON> Gunther </PERSON> ca n't quite remember his challenger's name. `` What is it? <PERSON> Devlin </PERSON>? <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON>?'' <PERSON> Gunther </PERSON> asked recently.

<TEXT>
 Developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> says he's considering such amenities as valet parking in upgrading <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' shuttle service, and plans to spend `` tremendous amounts of money. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> agreed Oct. 12 to purchase the profitable <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> shuttle from parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 365 million in cash. If it survives government scrutiny and a legal challenge by some of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unions, the sale is expected to be completed by Dec. 15. The operation, which links <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and is used mostly by business travelers, will be renamed the Trump Shuttle. The blue-silver <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> aircraft will be redecorated and emblazoned with red, black and gold stripes, and will carry <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s name on their tails `` I want to run an absolutely quality operation,'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said Friday in a telephone interview. The real estate magnate said he is ready to spend `` tremendous amounts of money on each individual airplane'' to accomplish his goal. The interiors of the 17 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727s will be completely redone using high-quality leather, carpeting and other materials, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said. He pledged to also stress safety by having each plane thoroughly checked and X-rayed, using procedures <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> claimed would be more stringent than Miami-based Eastern currently employs. The shuttle's airport terminals in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> also will be refurbished, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said. He said he is thinking seriously about introducing valet parking at the three airports for shuttle customers _ a service that would likely be an industry first. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said these improvements would take priority over possible plans to expand the shuttle service to <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, where he owns three casino-hotels. The developer runs a helicopter service between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> asserted that he will be able to carry out his expensive plans without raising fares on the shuttle, which competes with a rival service operated by <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` I'm just going to do it,'' he said. `` It's a substantial investment, but it's something that has to be done.''

Christ shared an apartment with a mistress in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>'s plush <LOCATION> Copacabana </LOCATION> district, the court was told. `` All Brazilian priests have a little business on the side,'' Christ testified in court, but he did not elaborate.

<HEAD>Dukakis Goes On The Attack As Bush Stays Home Today</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> went on the attack heading into a weekend of campaigning from the deep South to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, while Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was staying home today as the race for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approached its final two weeks. The Democratic presidential nominee, lagging behind <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the polls, was taking his case to television, both in a series of new, fiery commercials and in news interviews as he sought to raise his stock among the voters. In his television commercials, unveiled Friday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> calls <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attacks on his record `` full of lies and he knows it.'' However, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign has responded that the ads are truthful. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has been criticized for lacking passion, appears angry in an ad titled `` Counterpunch.'' `` I'm fed up with it,'' he says as he clicks off a television set showing a `` negative'' commercial for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> commercial, showing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> riding in a tank, attacks the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor on defense issues. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says in his ad that both candidates want a strong defense. `` So this is n't about defense issues. It's about dragging the truth into the gutter. And I'm not going to let them do it,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, called for an international agreement allowing on-site inspections on demand to enforce a ban on chemical weapons. `` The eventual combination of chemical weapons and ballistic missiles could put new destructive power in the hands of governments with terrorist records,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told an audience of about 1,200 at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toledo </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not mention that as vice president, he cast tie-breaking votes in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 and 1986 in favor of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chemical weapon arsenals. Those votes disturbed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON>, who criticized him after the second vote and then received a call from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> explaining why her son voted as he did. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today was meeting at his home in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Valladares </PERSON>, who was freed six years ago after serving 22 years in a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> prison. <PERSON> Valladares </PERSON>, who wrote about his ordeal in the book `` Against All Hope,'' has been cited by the vice president as one of his heroes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also planned to attend an Italian-American dinner tonight in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, too, was to attend that dinner, but his appearance was scheduled for later in the evening. The Democrat was starting his day with a joint appearance with vice presidential running mate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> before a group of pipefitters in <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, before heading to a barbecue in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and then a television interview in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Later he was flying to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and then to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who was taping an interview today with <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>, has made himself available for network television interviews over the last couple of days as he seeks to seize the offensive in the remaining days of the presidential campaign. But Republican vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the Democrats' fall in the polls is so steep, there can be no return. `` We have a strategy to win <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` Actually, I think the man from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> ... they might end up on election night maybe having a one-state strategy or maybe they'll just have a <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> strategy.''

<HEAD>Justice O'Connor Undergoes Surgery for Breast Cancer</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, the first woman on the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, is recovering from surgery for breast cancer and expects to return to work in 10 days. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, 58, underwent surgery Friday at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. But few details on the procedure or follow-up treatment were provided. `` I underwent surgery for breast cancer. It was found to exist in a very early form and stage,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said in a statement released by <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON>. `` The prognosis is for total recovery. I do not anticipate missing any oral arguments,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. The court is on a two-week recess and returns to hear arguments Oct. 31. The justices also will meet in private conference Oct. 28, but it was not known whether <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> will attend. Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, assistant professor of medicine and director of a cancer treatment unit at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s plan for a quick return to the bench would be `` a remarkably fast recovery'' and may be good news for her prognosis. He said the speed also may indicate the cancer was caught at a very early time and there is no indication it has spread to other organs in the body. <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> is not involved in <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s case. It was not disclosed whether <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s surgery was for removal of a lump or the entire breast. There also were no details on whether the justice will receive any form of continuing treatment and when the cancer was discovered. <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> said that typically when breast cancer is detected at a very early stage, the patient can choose to have either a lumpectomy, in which only the tumor is removed from the breast, or a modified radical mastectomy, in which the entire breast is removed. Either procedure usually involves removal of the lymph glands under the arm. For a lumpectomy, patients generally are released from the hospital in three to four days, <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> said, but return in two weeks to start radiation therapy. The radiation usually is given once a day, four to five days a week, for four to six weeks. For most patients, this is a difficult period because the radiation causes fatigue. `` It would be difficult to maintain a full schedule'' while receiving radiation, said <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>. But he noted that some patients handle it much more easily than others. Patients receiving a modified radical mastectomy do not require radiation therapy and usually return to work within two to three weeks. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s operation came just a year after first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> underwent surgery to remove her left breast after laboratory tests revealed a quarter-inch cancerous lesion. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, then 66, recovered quickly from the Oct. 17, 1987 surgery, a modified radical mastectomy. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s health, as far as is publicly known, has been good. She underwent an appendectomy in March and was soon back at work. <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices generally jealously guard the details of their health. In 1986, The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> inquired about a tremor _ a nodding motion of <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s head _ that has been apparent to court watchers for years. At times, the justice will rest her chin on her hands during the court's public oral argument sessions. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> sent back this reply through the court's public information office: `` I was unaware of such a tendency.'' As for resting her chin on her hands, she said it is `` an old and perhaps unfortunate habit.'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s appointment to be a justice by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1981 ended 191 years of male exclusivity on the high court. A political and judicial conservative, she has been a champion of states' rights and enhanced police power. But while she generally sides with the conservative wing of the court anchored by Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>, she has cast important moderate votes in such areas as sex discrimination and affirmative action. She was a virtual unknown on the national scene when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> picked her to replace <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, who had retired. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> served as an <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> state judge and before that was a member of that state's <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Most Private Employers Will Be Barred From Using Lie Detector
Tests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Beginning in December, most private employers will be barred by law from using polygraphs and other types of lie detectors to screen job applicants or test the current employees except in rare circumstances. Under new regulations issued Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, employers can be fined up to $ 10,000 for requiring a job seeker or employee already on their payrolls to submit to a polygraph exam for voice stress analysis. The regulations, which take effect Dec. 27, implement legislation passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> last June outlawing about 85 percent of the current use of lie detector tests. The congressional <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> had estimated that 2 million polygraph examinations were conducted last year _ 90 percent of them by private employers. Some 7.2 million employers nationwide will be required to put up posters in December summarizing the prohibitions and exemptions and outlining the rights of any worker asked to take a lie detector test. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, assistant labor secretary for employment standards, said the posters will be mailed out in the next three or four weeks. In addition to the fines, anyone required to take the test in violation of the new law can sue employers in federal and state courts for relief, such as employment reinstatement, promotion and any payment of lost wages and benefits. Exempted from protection under the ban are employees of federal, state and local governments or of federal contractors engaged in national security, intelligence or top secret activities. Also exempted from the ban are prospective employees of armored car, security alarm and security guard firms hired to protect operations affecting health and safety, national security or money. Pharmaceutical concerns or companies manufacturing, distributing or dispensing controlled substances also can require job applicants to submit to a lie detector test, but only for those people who would have direct access to the drugs. Polygraphs still can be used by employers to investigate specific incidents of theft, embezzlement or sabotage, but not a persistent problem, such as recurring inventory shortages. But any workers asked to submit to a polygraph exam under those conditions must be given at least 48 hours advance notice and a statement in advance telling them of their rights, including the right to refuse the test or to terminate it at any time. The pre-test statement also must explain the specific incident or activity being investigated and the basis for the employer's suspicion that the person asked to take the exam was involved in it Results of a polygraph test or refusal to submit to such an exam can not be used alone as a basis for taking any action against an employee. The regulations also forbid disclosure of the test results to anyone other than the employee without the employee's consent or a court order

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> says it is `` acceptable'' to use the tissue from intentionally aborted fetuses in medical research. However, the panel's 13-3 vote making that fundamental finding _ the core question it was asked to decide _ carefully avoided taking a position on the morality of abortion itself or, for that matter, the morality of using the remains of planned abortions for research. `` It is of moral relevance that human fetal tissue for research has been obtained from induced abortions,'' said the draft document completed Friday. `` However, in light of the fact that abortion is legal and that the research in question is intended to achieve significant medical goals, the panel concludes that the use of such tissue is acceptable public policy.'' It went on to say that the committee position `` must not obscure the profound moral dimensions of the issue of abortion, nor the principled positions that divide scholars, scientists and the public at large. It is not the charge of this panel to attempt to settle the issue of abortion or to weigh the worthiness of competing principled perspectives on abortion itself.'' Researchers are hopeful that transplanting fetal brain cells into the brains of people with diabetes and Parkinson's disease could provide an effective treatment _ perhaps in three to five years _ and that more study could lead to similar treatments for a number of other serious diseases for which there now is no cure. The new procedure has been used experimentally on a handful of patients in other countries with promising results. The advisory committee was formed to examine moral, ethical, legal and scientific issues after <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> scientists sought permission to transplant fetal brain cells into some Parkinson's sufferers. The committee's agreement on a lengthy draft document Friday will not become final before Nov. 30, the date for submission of mail ballots on whether to adopt the exact language that will be written by <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> employees working to polish the principles adopted by the panel over five days of discussion going back to last month. In the draft version approved Friday, the panel laid out a number of recommended safeguards once research proceeds: _ `` The decision to terminate a pregnancy and the procedures of abortion should be kept independent from the retrieval and use of fetal tissue.'' _ `` Proper and informed consent should be obtained from the pregnant woman.'' _ `` Payments and other forms of remuneration and compensation associated with the procurement of fetal tissue should be prohibited, except payment for reasonable expenses occasioned by the actual retrieval, storage, preparation and transportation of the tissues.'' _ `` Potential recipients of such tissues, as well as any and all other participants, including researchers, hospital personnel and other service-providers, should be properly informed as to the source of the tissues in question.'' The panel also concluded that donations of fetal tissue to a family member or acquaintance for medical purposes should be banned to discourage women from becoming pregnant with the intention of having an abortion and donating the tissue to a sick relative or close friend.

 Screening tests for the AIDS virus are more accurate than two years ago, but medical practitioners should have at least two tests performed before informing an infected patient that he has the disease, according to a study by experts. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> expert on AIDS testing, said some medical workers are still telling patients that they have the disease after only a single test. `` The current tests are very, very good, but they are not 100 percent,'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said Friday. He noted that only 10 percent of patients testing positive in an initial screening test for AIDS actually have the disease. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> presented a report compiled by testing experts after three days of discussion at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION>. The report recommends that AIDS testing should not be considered definitive until both screening and confirmatory tests are completed. And, in some cases, even further testing is needed. He said the testing sequence should start with a screening test called ELISA -LRB- for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay -RRB-. For those with a positive ELISA test, he added, there should then be a confirmation test called a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blot </LOCATION>. Both laboratory tests are based on the presence in the patient's bloodstream of antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome `` If you test 10,000 people for HIV, the current tests would give an ELISA positive on 0.2 percent -LRB- or 20 -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>. `` Out of the 10,000, the Western Blot -LRB- confirming test -RRB- would be needed only on those 20 samples.'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said that only about 10 percent of people testing positive by the ELISA test are actually infected with AIDS. As a result, he said, `` You do n't tell someone that they are HIV positive on ELISA alone.'' Some samples, <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said, can not be confirmed as positive or negative even with both <ORGANIZATION> ELISA </ORGANIZATION> and Western Blot. He said the expert panel recommended that this `` indeterminate'' group undergo additional and different tests before a final report is made to the patient. AIDS is a contagious disease that attacks the body's immune system and makes it incapable of defending against infection. The disease is not now curable, and no one has been known to recover from it. As of Monday, there have been 75,768 AIDS cases reported in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and 42,653 have died. AIDS testing was one of four subjects addressed in a unique gathering of medical testing experts at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION>. The group included testing specialists from government agencies, industry and hospitals. Officials said the purpose of the three-day meeting was to draw up recommendations for assuring that the nation's laboratories are providing accurate testing. The group issued recommended ways to improve testing for AIDS, for drug abuse, for cholesterol, and for the Pap smear cancer screening test. Among the recommendations were: _ Though testing for cholesterol was found generally to be accurate in hospital laboratories, the group recommended that cholesterol measurements made in a physician's office laboratory should be studied, since these labs often are not part of a routine quality control program _ A common system of measuring the presence and concentration of drugs in urine tests should be established nationally The experts said that there now exists a common reference material -LRB- a sample containing pure drugs at known concentrations -RRB- for marijuana, but not for other controlled drugs such as cocaine, PCP or amphetamines. The report said that such a common reference material would increase the accuracy of drug testing. _ The panel also said that the analysis of urine specimens can identify an exposure to drugs, but it does not measure the level of impairment The experts recommended that research be conducted to determine how such impairment can be measured accurately. _ The experts said that false-negative findings in Pap smears, a test for the presence of cervical cancer, are running as high as 4 percent to 8 percent, but that these errors often are a result of poor technique in collecting specimens The panel recommended that the Pap specimen collection technique be standardized and that women patients receive better instructions in how to prepare for this test. Dr. <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraemer </PERSON>, a laboratory director at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, said though there are inaccuracies in Pap smear tests, the procedure is still `` a woman's best friend'' in the war against cancer and `` one of the most successful lifesaving laboratory procedures'' now commonly

<TEXT>
 The first deaf president in the history of 124-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's only university for the hearing impaired, challenged the students in his inaugural address to `` try and do everything under the sun.'' `` Today Gallaudet is not simply installing its eighth president,'' said Dr. I. <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, who was selected as president last March after a tumultuous week of protests over the naming of a hearing woman to the post. `` We are recognizing the right of every disabled person to have unlimited goals and expectations,'' <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> told about 2,400 faculty, staff and students jammed into the school's gym for his installation as president Friday. The hearing woman who initially was named to the post, Dr. <PERSON> Elisabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON>, eventually stepped aside and <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, 45, was selected. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, who lost his hearing in a motorcycle accident in 1968, is a 1973 <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION> graduate who earned masters and doctorate degrees from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION>. He served as dean of <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> before being chosen as president. He pledged to expand programs preparing <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION>'s 2,200 undergraduate and graduate student for a larger place in the hearing world. `` I challenge every person in this room to take up his motivation, and have the courage to try and do anything under the sun,'' <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said. `` I challenge you to succeed.'' Urging the school to use the energy generated during the week of protests to continue lobbying for the rights of the hearing impaired everywhere, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said, `` Gallaudet must become a working model for open access everywhere. Take the events of last March to your hearts and your hands to make the world responsive to deaf people.'' <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deaf </ORGANIZATION>, told the crowd that <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>'s installation `` marks the emancipation of deaf people from the shackles of limitations.'' Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>, whose brother is deaf, delivered part of his remarks in sign language, which drew appreciative cheers from the audience. He called those who struggled for selection of a deaf leader `` my heroes,'' and told an anecdote about how far the story of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s selection had spread: `` Last summer, I was in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and a group of deaf students wanted to know about the president,'' <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON> said. `` They were n't interested in <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> They wanted to hear about Dr. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>.''

<HEAD>TVA Charged With Violating NRC Regulations Through False Statement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Repeated false statements by the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear program constitute a violation of federal regulations by the <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> charges. However, the commission said it has decided not to take action on the original statements by <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. White, a former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear submarine program, `` as a matter of prosecutorial discretion.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> also decided, according to a letter sent Friday to <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON>, not to assess a fine because `` a civil penalty for this matter is not necessary to further focus the attention of either <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> or the industry on the importance of complete candor'' in dealing with the commission, the letter said. The <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Directors </ORGANIZATION>, in a statement read by spokeswoman <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> <PERSON> Akers </PERSON>, defended White while praising the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s decision not to assess a fine. `` We continue to believe that Admiral <PERSON> White </PERSON> did not intend to mislead the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> on this or any other matter,'' the statement said. `` We are pleased that the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> did not fine <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> upon completion of this investigation,'' according to the statement. `` However, we are disappointed that <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> received a notice of a violation on statements relating to Appendix B. ... The <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> board is fully committed to operating a safe and reliable nuclear power program.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s letter said the <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> has 30 days to admit or deny the allegations and to show what corrections it has undertaken if the charge is admitted. The case concerns a March 1986 letter <PERSON> White </PERSON> wrote to the commission. White had been hired a few months earlier to shape up <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION>'s nearly collapsed nuclear effort that had seen the closure of five reactors. <PERSON> White </PERSON> wrote the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> that there had been `` no pervasive breakdown of the quality assurance program'' at the Watts Bar plant under construction near <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn </LOCATION>. He repeated that assurance in a follow-up letter and in statements to <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> investigators, adding that he had received a review of the program by outside experts. In fact, according to previous commission testimony to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and according to Friday's letter, <PERSON> White </PERSON> had not even spoken with seven of the nine people he identified as constituting the outside review group, and the two people he did speak with had not reviewed <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION>'s quality assurance efforts but had only given opinions of the work of an earlier in-house group. `` No one identified by Mr. <PERSON> White </PERSON> as being a member of the second group understood there to be such a group,'' the letter said. In April, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Investigations testified before a congressional panel that White was playing word games. <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> told the investigations subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> White </PERSON> apparently was intending `` pervasive'' to mean `` 100 percent.'' While technically true, <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION>'s quality assurance had serious and widespread problems, he said. At the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> staff, an internal group headed by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, assistant executive director for operations, concluded that White's statements were not deliberately false The matter was referred to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which has refused to comment on the status of the case. White has denied any wrongdoing and has been supported by the <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> board. He is retiring in January. The letter, signed by <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, now deputy executive director for regional operations, said the violation was being assessed even though White is leaving because `` <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> management as a whole is responsible for the quality of communications with the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` Both the individuals involved and the organization must share responsibility for the actions giving rise to these violations, but the fundamental premise of our regulatory system makes <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION>, as the licensee, ultimately responsible,'' the letter said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> must be confident that it can rely on the information furnished by a licensee,'' the letter said. `` ... Anything less than accurate and complete statements to the commission can not and will not be tolerated.''

 The Democratic slide in the polls is so steep that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> could be left with a `` one state strategy'' on election day, <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. And as he stumped through the South on Friday, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> worked to steal a line his Democratic counterpart used to devastating effect in the vice presidential debate. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, he declared, `` is no <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>'' and wo n't be making a comeback. A confident-sounding <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said there's a sharp contrast between Republican and Democratic election strategies. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told college students in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> has a `` 50-state strategy'' and made light of reports that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is narrowing his focus to about 18 states with enough electoral votes for a win. `` We have a strategy to win <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` Actually, I think the man from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> ... they might end up on election night maybe having a one-state strategy or maybe they'll just have a <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> strategy.'' The quip that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` is no <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>'' comes straight from Democrat <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> who scored the premier moment of the vice presidential debate when he told <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, `` You're no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> described a conversation between <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, and his father, a former senator. `` I guess he -LRB- Gore Jr. -RRB- called home and talked to his dad, when his father told him that this reminded him of the <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> campaign in 1948,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` Let me tell you something, I do n't know <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, I never served with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is not a good friend of mine. `` But I know this: <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is no <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> used precisely that cadence in setting up <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> for his debate zinger, and aides said Friday's speech was the first time <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had referred to the put-down in a campaign appearance. Republican presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had also set the stage when he used a similar line in a self-deprecating fashion during a dinner in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Thursday night. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> insisted the comparison was apt because many were `` trying to compare the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign to the <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> campaign.'' <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> was perceived to be trailing throughout the 1948 campaign, but ended up defeating Republican <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON>. Most polls show the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket this year with a persistent lead, and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> insisted there will be no comeback this time around. During his Southern swing, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> spoke to the college students in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> at a noisy rally where critics and backers competed for attention, repeatedly interrupting the candidate. `` They've always been negative and they always will be,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` They are the party of failure. We are the party of success. `` They can go ahead and yell,'' he said. `` We're going to talk about issues and ideas.'' Throughout his Southern swing, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> took a tough stance against a tax increase and in favor of defense as he courted conservative voters in a region where most polls suggest <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is strong. At a flag-waving riverside rally in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> made a frank appeal for backing from conservative southern Democrats. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, he argued, is `` not in the southern Democratic tradition of national defense. Disenchanted Democrats are fed up with liberalism.'' He got some cheering news from the crowd, including one sign which read `` Thank God Quayle is no JFK.''

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is taking a weekend breather from the campaign trail after warning <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> supporters against complacency and boasting that running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has been `` tested by steel.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was keeping a light schedule today, meting with <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Valladares </PERSON>, author of `` Against All Hope,'' a harrowing account of his years as a political prisoner in a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> prison. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> mentioned the book in his last debate with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tonight was attending an Italian-American banquet in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also was putting in a separate appearance. After taking Sunday off, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> heads back on the road Monday for a swing through <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, with stops in <LOCATION> Waterford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, he launches a drive-to-the-wire, cross-country trip for the final two weeks of the campaign, starting with a return to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> for the sixth time since the GOP convention In a high school gym in <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and earlier in a hockey arena in Troy, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> laid the rhetorical wood to his opponent's policies and lauded his running mate. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator has `` been tempered by steel. He's been taking a pounding out there Steel gets tough when it's under fire.'' <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, with 23 electoral votes, `` is a critical state,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` The election still hangs in the balance, and I am running _ even though things feel pretty good _ just as though I were 10 points back,'' he told 2,000 people at <ORGANIZATION> Lancaster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where he was surrounded by cheerleaders in a gym festooned with balloons and a huge, hand-lettered `` Good Night, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>'' banner. `` He does n't like the L-word anymore because he's trying to move to the middle ... and we're not going to let him,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Although the <LOCATION> Buckeye </LOCATION> state went twice for <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is ahead in polls in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> press secretary <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said, `` It's not locked up by any means.'' <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> was questioned about Friday's indictment of former <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> dictator <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for praising <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' commitment to democracy during a 1981 visit to <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. `` His view is that the judicial process should go forward,'' <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said. In Troy, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recited his full anti-Dukakis litany, attacking the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor for vetoing a mandatory Pledge of Allegiance law, ridiculing his prison furlough program and taking a double-edged swipe at the Democrat's economic and environmental record. `` There just is n't any <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> miracle. The last miracle in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> was when they found a fish alive in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> quipped. At the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toledo </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> decried the `` terrible scourge'' of chemical warfare and called Friday for sanctions against nations that resort to germ warfare, on-site inspection of suspicious plants and an overture to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to help stop the spread of ballistic missiles. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has long said one of his goals as president would be to banish all chemical weapons from the earth _ an issue given new urgency by the use of nerve gas in the Iran-Iraq war. He spoke of his horror at seeing photographs of a Kurdish mother `` trying to protect her child, waving her arms against the invisible winds of death'' after an Iraqi attack. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign has challenged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s credibility on this issue, citing three tie-breaking votes the vice president cast in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 and 1986 to fund <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production of new chemical weapons. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> policy aide, said the old <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stockpiles were deteriorating and the new, binary weapons were safer. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s octogenarian mother, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON>, criticized her son after the second chemical weapons vote in 1983 _ and got a phone call from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> explaining why her <PERSON> George </PERSON> voted that way.

 Indicted former Philippine President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> received no promises from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials to persuade him to leave his country without bloodshed during a popular, military-based revolt in 1986, officials say. More than 2 -LCB- years after he fled the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, and six others were indicted Friday on racketeering charges involving a vast fortune the Marcoses allegedly stole from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Action by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a federal appeals court and the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government opened the final doors to that indictment which came in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investigation that began shortly after <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was airlifted to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> in February 1986. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> who was <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> liaison with <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> during his first three months of Hawaiian exile, said Friday that no high official, including President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, made any promises to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. `` We offered refuge because the prospect of violence threatened him and his family and to avoid a very bloody confrontation in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Belize </LOCATION>, where he is now the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador. `` There is no indication that anyone at high levels offered anything inappropriate.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> claims in a lawsuit filed in <LOCATION> Honoluu </LOCATION> that he was deceived into leaving his country against his will. The case against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has involved discussions with <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> officials and months of dealings among the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Both State and <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> department sources confirmed that there were disagreements over how to handle the case, with <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> wanting to indict prior to plea bargaining with <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and State urging a pre-indictment attempt to bargain. A plea bargain which <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> rejected was described by one official as an attempt to get <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return his vast wealth to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, which is the main objective of the case. The government of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> alleges that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his associates took out of the country $ 5 billion to $ 10 billion, much of it stashed in Swiss banks. The way was cleared for the indictment after a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> announcement Thursday that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would `` not prevent the law from taking its course.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> later said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was saddened by the court action because <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was a friend. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had invited <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and administration officials were concerned about the impact the indictment would have on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> credibility in dealing with foreign rulers in the future. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said after the indictment, `` We did n't make any promises we could n't keep. Any foreign leader can take our word on anything.'' Another administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> apparently came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because it was where he `` felt safest and most comfortable. If he went to another place, he might end up ripped off by another authoritarian ruler.'' But <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> said he believes that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> in 1986 probably planned to stay in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> only for a few months, miscalculating the viability of the Aquino government and the lack of interest other countries had in taking him. He and his wife are restricted to the island of <LOCATION> Oahu </LOCATION> because of his attempt last year to return to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say they are honoring a <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government request that he not be allowed to return. On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> upheld a civil contempt finding against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife for failing to turn over evidence to the grand jury that handed up the indictments. That decision also rejected <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' pleas for immunity. Last week, the Philippine government issued a formal waiver of any immunity <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> might be allowed from prosecution as a former head of state.

<HEAD>Congress Passes Bill Reforming Distribution of Disaster Relief</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A bill reforming the way the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> distributes aid after natural disasters has been approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and sent to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for his signature. The Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Amendments of 1988 had their roots in the government's response to tornadoes that raced through <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> before hitting <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> on May 31, 1985, killing 90 people. Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridge </PERSON>, R-Pa., authored the bill after complaining that the help offered by <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 failed to meet the needs of residents and municipalities facing major repairs At a hearing on the bill last year, Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., said reform was necessary because <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> `` has gained the notoriety of being very cumbersome and tortuous for the citizens of this nation to understand. The bill died in the 99th Congress, was introduced again last year, and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> finally passed it in the spring. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed a companion bill by voice vote Friday. Since the measure was slightly different from the version the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had passed earlier, it was sent back to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which approved it Friday night. The legislation was sent to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who was expected to sign it. Among other reforms, the bill would bar <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> from paying less than a 75 percent share of aid to local governments qualifying for public repair projects following a disaster. It would add guidelines to speed the distribution of post-disaster aid and would permit federal funds to be used for the first time for local projects designed to lessen the effect of disasters before they strike. The measure also would make temporary housing assistance through <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> available for up to 18 months, six months longer than under the current system. Originally, the measure was opposed by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, which said its initial price tag _ $ 15 to $ 20 million per year above what <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> pays now _ was too high. But the bill's cost was trimmed down to zero by eliminating some administrative expenses and by asking state and local governments to share some of the cost of aid in a federally declared emergency, among other changes.

<TEXT>
 Here are some comments from the presidential campaign trail Friday: <PERSON> MICHAEL </PERSON> <PERSON> DUKAKIS </PERSON>, slamming the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> camp for emphasizing the fact that convicted murder <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> escaped while on furlough and terrorized a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> couple: `` To play politics with that kind of human tragedy, I think, is one of the most cynical things you can do.'' Sen. <PERSON> SAM </PERSON> <PERSON> NUNN </PERSON>, D-Ga., speculating on what he would do if he were in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' shoes: `` I would n't have been a punching bag on some of these issues There are some very unfair allegations going on, and what I've been amazed at is how the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign has been able to get away with it and to be fairly successful at it so far. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has really got to take off the gloves; he's got to defend himself.'' <PERSON> GEORGE </PERSON> <PERSON> BUSH </PERSON>, advocating an international ban on chemical weapons but failing to mention his tie-breaking votes in 1983 and 1986 in favor of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chemical weapons arsenals: `` The eventual combination of chemical weapons and ballistic missiles could put new destructive power in the hands of governments with terrorist records.'' <PERSON> DAN </PERSON> <PERSON> QUAYLE </PERSON>, saying the Democrats will not stage a Harry Truman-style comeback this year, copying a line used against him in the vice presidential debate: `` I do n't know <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, I never served with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is not a good friend of mine. `` But I know this: <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is no <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> RONALD </PERSON> <PERSON> REAGAN </PERSON>, praising <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for keeping a cool head in times of crisis: `` ... I have given him some of the most sensitive and difficult tasks that we've had, and he's never let me or the country down.'' <PERSON> LLOYD </PERSON> <PERSON> BENTSEN </PERSON>, seeking to assuage Texans' fears that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is soft on defense: `` I would n't be running on a ticket with a candidate who would weaken <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s defense.''

<HEAD>Soviets Offer To Break Path To Trapped Whales</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Trapped Whales Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has offered to start moving an icebreaking ship today toward the stranded whales in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> if current rescue efforts do n't succeed, according to a teleprinter message sent from Soviet officials to <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are taking efforts on assisting in whales rescue operations,'' said the message sent Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Hydrometeorology. The ship, the Admiral <PERSON> Makarov </PERSON>, was 300 miles north of <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barrow </LOCATION> and would be able to move toward the whales today after finishing work on establishing a research station on the ice and rescuing an ice-trapped Soviet ship, the <LOCATION> Arseniev </LOCATION>, the message said. The offer was made in the event the three gray whales still are trapped by the gathering ice next Wednesday, when the Soviets anticipated the icebreaking ship could arrive at the scene. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> <PERSON> Plowder </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> said that as a shot in the dark, he asked on Monday, through scientific contacts in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, if any Soviet icebreaker was in a position to help the whales. The answer was Friday's cable. The Soviet message, which requests <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>'s help in obtaining <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government permission to sail in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territorial waters, expresses some doubts about the success of the mission. `` We do not have complete assurance in this venture because of shallow waters for icebreaker in the area of rescue,'' the message said. In addition, the Soviets said, the `` ice ridge is about 120 miles from that area and we are in doubts ... that whales would be able to pass through the channel made by icebreaker.'' <PERSON> Plowder </PERSON> said he has asked the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for immediate clearance for the ship to enter <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> waters and was told the department would `` assess the technical aspects'' first. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, said it has asked Soviet authorities what assets they may have available to help free the whales. The Soviets responded with information on where they have ice breakers and how long it would take them to arrive at the scene, said a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official who asked not to be identified. According to the official, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities are evaluating the Soviet information and are comparing it with other options for rescuing the whales.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is on the air with four new hard-hitting commercials and tonight is delivering a five-minute televised appeal for support. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor got a rousing reception Friday night from several thousand people who filled the gymnasium on the campus of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION>. `` At the rate we're going, we're going to be importing 50 percent of our oil by 1990,'' he said. `` Even before we're inaugurated, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and I are going to call a bipartisan energy summit for this country ... and that summit will be chaired by the vice president-elect of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The commercials and television speech are the latest effort by the Democratic presidential candidate to pick up momentum in his race against Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` The central point -LRB- of the new ads -RRB- is the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign and their advertising are not to be believed,'' said campaign press secretary <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>. The new <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ads started running Friday in key states. Television was the latest weapon in the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> effort to overtake <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and emerge as an upset winner on Election Day, a little more than two weeks away. His five-minute speech will air at 10:55 p.m. EDT, on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. Aides said the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate also would appear Tuesday night on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> show `` Nightline.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaigned Friday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> before flying to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for the night. At <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> African <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> renewed his pledge to wage a war on drugs and said, `` Our determination to win this war should know no bounds.'' His next stop was <LOCATION> McKeesport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, where he told a crowd that waited in the rain, `` Do n't let anyone tell you the steel industry is dead in this country. It is n't, it's not going to be and we are going to help bring it back.'' Actor <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, who starred in the movie `` Broadcast News,'' was on the platform with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and told the crowd, `` I'm a liberal and I'm a great guy. Then turning to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, he said, `` This guy's a liberal, he's a great guy.'' Two of the new <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> television ads were responses to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attacks on the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prison furlough program and on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' positions on defense issues. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wo n't talk about the thousands of drug kingpins furloughed from federal prisons while he led the war on drugs,'' says one <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ad. `` The real story about furloughs is that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has taken a furlough from the truth.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign is running a television ad that shows <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> riding in a tank and describes him as opposed to a range of major weapons systems. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> response shows the Democratic nominee watching the opening moment of that ad and then turning it off. `` I'm fed up with it,'' says <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` Have n't seen anything like it in 25 years of public life, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s negative TV ads.'' The other two ads attack <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for failing to stop the flow of drugs into the country and for planning to cut the capital gains tax, what <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> describes as `` tax breaks to the rich.''

 <LOCATION> EL-ALAMEIN </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ This dusty coastal village of Bedouin houses, car repair shops, a rest house and two gas stations has little to offer for the living _ except memories of the dead. On Sunday, 2,000 people are expected here to mourn those who fell in World War II in the Battle of el-Alamein. Since 1978, the Service of Remembrance for the more than 70,000 casualties of the battle has been held on the Sunday nearest to Oct. 23. That was the night 46 years ago when English Gen. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Law </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> launched a devastating attack on the elite Axis divisions of `` The Desert Fox,'' German Field Marshal <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rommel </PERSON>. The decisive battle began at 9:40 p.m. when <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>'s guns opened fire under a full moon after a day of blistering heat. Rain had turned the desert to mud by the time the battle was won early Nov. 4, ending <PERSON> Rommel </PERSON>'s relentless march across <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> toward <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION>. It cleared the way for the Allies to open a second front in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. This year's main ceremony will be held beneath the pink and green foliage of the Commonwealth Cemetery, an English garden setting against a desert backdrop. Among those who will take part is <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s defense secretary, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Younger </PERSON>, who arrived with a delegation of 41, including about a dozen war widows and 17 veterans. The cemetery, with its rows of marked and unmarked graves, is an emotional reminder of the battle wedged in the 30 miles of wasteland between the quicksand-filled Qattarra Depression to the south and the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> to the north. The largest war cemetery in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, it contains the graves of <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> soldiers who died at <LOCATION> el-Alamein </LOCATION> as well as some who fell earlier in the <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>. English architect Sir <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Worthington </PERSON> came to el-Alamein in the summer of 1943, just months after <PERSON> Rommel </PERSON> was repelled, to design a garden cemetery in the harsh surroundings. He determined that walls were necessary to keep out drifting sand, and cloisters with hearty plants to make visits pleasant even in the hottest months. Of the 7,352 graves, 815 bear unknown remains. Jew and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> lie side by side. English soldiers and Canadians are buried beside Australians, Indians, East Africans, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION>, Sudanese, Belgians, Frenchmen, Greeks, Poles, troopers from the old High Commission Territories and unknown Allied dead from other North African campaigns. On the walls in front of the cemetery are listed names of 11,495 others lost in all desert campaigns. East of the Commonwealth Cemetery is a separate smaller memorial to Greek combatants, and monuments to Axis losses are to the west. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s mausoleum, dazzling white against the azure sea, holds the remains of 3,241 soldiers. A short distance away, the dark, round, fortress-like German memorial dominates a sandy hill beside the shore. Its walls shelter 4,280 remains. In its center courtyard, a tablet reads: `` The price of pride is high, and paid by the young.'' There has been occasional talk of halting the annual commemoration, but Wing Cmdr. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Edmunds </PERSON>, who heads this year's program, said that is not being seriously considered. `` For the younger generations, World War II is becoming part of a deep, dark past, but for others this time of year recalls el-Alamein,'' he said. `` <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> still has large Italian and Greek communities who gather for the ceremony.'' <PERSON> Edmunds </PERSON> remembers studying about el-Alamein in detail as a child because `` it was such a turning point for the Allies. We were doing OK in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, awful in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and had n't done well in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. After el-Alamein, all that changed.'' The Sahara's constantly shifting sands have made it impossible to know the exact numbers of el-Alamein's dead. Untold thousands of men are hidden. From time to time the featureless landscape, too dry even for shrubs, releases a stilled skeleton or exposes a mine. Estimates of casualties _ dead, wounded, captured and missing _ total 72,500: the Axis suffered 59,000 and the Commonwealth sustained 13,500. <ORGANIZATION> El-Alamein </ORGANIZATION> tells the story of its 12 days in world history in a small museum. The visitor passes large Nazi and <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> flags on the way to display cases of weaponry, uniforms, battle plans and related documents. Department-store dummies are decked out as the meticulous and calculating <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> and lean <PERSON> Rommel </PERSON>. Outside is a row of tanks, gathering dust, including the Italians' M-13 that <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>'s tankmen called the `` self-propelled coffin.''

 Shiite Moslem kidnappers on Friday threatened to harm two American hostages to retaliate for Israeli air attacks on <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> and pro-Iranian guerrilla bases in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` Committing this stupidity and this attack shall not pass without a punishment,'' said a typewritten statement in Arabic signed by <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jihad </ORGANIZATION>, the pro-Iranian faction holding <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and educator <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>. The typewritten Arabic statement was delivered to the independent <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspaper An-Nahar hours after the attack. An authenticating color picture of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> was delivered to the <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> news agency with a copy of the statement, but it was the same photograph the group released of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> in April. The statement praised the Shiite Moslem suicide car bomber who killed seven Israeli soldiers and wounded eight soldiers and two <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> women in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-declared security zone in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Wednesday. That attack prompted <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s retaliatory air strike, which killed 15 people and wounded 35 in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Friday. The instant photo showed <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, wearing a Commodore Hotel T-shirt and a bushy beard and mustache. He looked straight into the camera without his glasses. It was the 11th picture released of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s longest-held foreign captive, abducted in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> March 16, 1985. It was the same photograph released of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> on April 10, when <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION> threatened to harm the hostages if a Kuwaiti jetliner hijacked to <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> was stormed to free the passengers. The 29-line statement began with several verses from the Koran, <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s holy book, and deplored <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s air attack as a `` challenge to the will of our oppressed people.'' It accused the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration of giving <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> advance approval to attack <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, had claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing. `` The criminal <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> must realize it will not get away with what it has done, especially in connection with the hostages we hold, so that will be a lesson to whoever strikes at the dignity and glory of our people and mujahedeen -LRB- holy fighters -RRB-,'' it said. <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>, considered to be <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s spiritual leader, said he would do his best to protect the hostages. `` We continue to respect our previous commitments to defend human rights in order to see these hostages free and safe as soon as possible,'' he said. `` We will do our utmost to see that nothing happens to any of them.'' He spoke in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON>, a Canadian representative of <ORGANIZATION> Ambassadors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION>, a group that helps orphans in Third World countries. In <LOCATION> Cadiz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON>, issued a statement asking his captors to `` recognize that <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> is totally innocent and has never been involved in the continuing <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> strife except as a captive for 3 -LCB- years.'' `` It is totally unjust to hold him responsible for the military actions of another country,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Say </PERSON> said. Friday's statement was the first since Aug. 18, when the group said none of its hostages would be released soon. <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, 56, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Collins </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, was acting dean of agriculture at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> when he was abducted June 9, 1985. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> are among nine Americans believed held by pro-Iranian extremist factions linked to <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. Others held are three Britons, an Irishman and an Italian. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> called for an end to violence between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and urged the kidnappers to free their hostages. Asked about the Islamic Jihad warning, he said: `` These are innocent victims. They are being held through no fault of their own ... And the appeal to the hostage-holders has to be always, ` Release these innocent people.''' In a separate development Friday, the weekly <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> magazine <PERSON> Ash-Shiraa </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> were working out a new deal to free the American hostages before the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential election on Nov. 8. <PERSON> Ash-Shiraa </PERSON> said the deal would ensure the victory of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in exchange for a commitment from the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate to rearm <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. There was no way to verify the report. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has stressed that it has no contacts with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Ash-Shiraa, which has access to Iranian hardliners, gained international fame in Nov. 1986 when it broke the story of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> secret arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. But most of its subsequent reports about the hostages have been inaccurate. Other reports have said both <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democratic candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sent envoys to work out a deal with the Iranians on the hostages. Both candidates denied the reports.

 Merry widow corset effects gave definition to <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagerfeld </PERSON>'s summer ready-to-wear collection. But even with these ribbed waistlines, his show was full of softness, a new note on the fashion scene. The new, easy clothes were appealing, but lacked the firm dynamics that the fashion world has come to expect of <LOCATION> Lagerfeld </LOCATION>. Most of the clothes shown Friday were nice without being sensational. A lot of pants, very straight and not too wide, looked excellent in off-white topped by deep rose or dusty green blazers. Seen on soft green jersey dresses, the merry widow touch of ribbed seams was a detail that never cinched the waist in. Another option was pinstriped trouser suits, and high hats gave them trouser suits a raffish, 19th century charm. A few short skirts cropped up, notably in some white knit `` tennis'' style dresses with red or green stripes at hem and turtle neck. But they were just a few inches above the knee. <LOCATION> Lagerfeld </LOCATION> announced long ago that longer skirts were coming in, and he sees that they do, showing most skirts way below knee level. With a few pastels and plenty of black and white in linens, knits and cottons, the effect was nearly subdued. For those who love knits and do n't want the ribbed corset effect, a lot of easy pleated midcalf skirts were belted near the hip with wide and handsome belts with gobby metal decor. <PERSON> Lagerfeld </PERSON> played around with jackets, making some hems in tulip shapes, belting others, cutting out some fitted numbers with rounded decolletes. Coat dresses at <LOCATION> Lagerfeld </LOCATION> were long and full, almost ending up looking like housecoats in a wallpaper flower print. The navy wool crepe full-skirted coat dress was topped by a big organdy bow _ also added to a simple but easily-cut trouser suit. <PERSON> Lagerfeld </PERSON> also came up with an excellent suite of tiered and pleated ivory crepe de chine numbers with fullish leg o' mutton sleeves and wide brown belts. The evening wear was sparse but did feature some fitted and full-skirted dresses, some with chiffon halter necklines and skirts, others with long, fitted torsoes in black lace and white pique. Easy-to-wear was also the idea at <PERSON> Popy </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreni </PERSON>, an Italian-born designer who has been showing in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for several years now. Her clothes were often based on gray _ in full shiny wool trench coats, in wool and silk trouser suits and dresses with full skirts. The overall effect was always girlish. To contrast with all the gray, lilac and yellow also came out in wide knit culotte suits or paired with charcoal in draped tops. With details like jabots on pinstriped shirt-jackets, or full skirts under fitted torsoes, the clothes were feminine and young. For the sporty set, <PERSON> Moreni </PERSON> also showed a line of striped wide Bermudas and shorts. The dressy touch here was also disarmingly girlish in a series of long-skirted ivory silks and a big line of white cottons with ruffles and tiers that looked like simplified versions of 18th century frilliness. For garden parties or dressy barbecues, the pretty flowered chiffon dresses or multicolored rainbow numbers had unsophisticated charm. Like all of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Perris </PERSON> showed plenty of pants, from buttoned, tight toreador style to the widest pyjamas. His lines were always soft, but jackets for long skirts and trousers were cut with big wing lapels and swallow-tails. The color scheme was subdued, with soft pearl gray and pastels in light wools, cotton and silks. Even the boleros were waist-nipped, and while the emphasis was on dressier clothes, <PERSON> Perris </PERSON> also brought out wide street shorts with cuffs and spencer jackets.

<HEAD>Silence Is Golden For IRA, Thatcher Supporters Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 To critics, the British government has forsaken democracy with its decision to end the right of suspects to remain silent under police interrogation in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. But supporters, including distinguished judges, hailed the announcement Thursday by Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government as a sensible, long overdue move that will mean fewer terrorists go free Either way, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government is prepared to dump the British equivalent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution's Fifth Amendment. The Fifth Amendment holds that no person `` shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself ... without due process of law.'' New laws, expected to be passed for <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> by January and for <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> by 1990, will allow a judge or jury to deduce, if they wish, that a suspect's refusal to answer police questions after arrest is an indication of guilt. At present, courts are not allowed to take into consideration a suspect's silence _ under laws dating from the 17th century and designed to protect illiterate suspects from unfairly or wrongly incriminating themselves. But government officials note times have changed. In <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, where the law is aimed mainly at the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, police find guerrilla suspects well-trained in how to sit it out: staring at a wall through days of interrogation, sitting with their heads between their legs to avoid eye contact with interrogators, or lying under a table. Elsewhere, In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s officials argue, regular criminals, particularly sophisticated racketeers and drug dealers, are similarly expert. `` Is it really in the interests of justice that experienced criminals should be able to refuse to answer all police questions secure in the knowledge that a jury will never hear of it?'' said Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, Republican News, the newspaper of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s legal political front, <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, advises arrested guerrillas: `` Interrogation _ Whatever you say, say nothing. You must make up your mind not to speak until you return home.'' `` What I have to deal with is a sustained and deliberate attack on the whole system of justice,'' said <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> Secretary <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>. He is <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s top official in the province torn by Roman Catholic-Protestant strife. Main targets are suspects who say nothing to police and then come up with elaborate defenses, including detailed alibis, weeks or months later in court. However, critics say no abuse of the right to silence can warrant attacking the fundamentals of a free society. As recently as 1981, a government-appointed inquiry into criminal procedures concluded the right to silence should be preserved. Since 1973, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> has had no-jury, one-judge courts because of the difficulty of getting frightened juries to convict or witnesses to testify at <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> trials. Both sides point to the fact that in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, less than one-fourth of people arrested under anti-terrorism laws are charged. Police say this reflects the ability of the guilty to stay silent: critics say it shows police make massive and unjustified arrests under anti-terrorist laws _ and the end of the right to silence hands police more power to abuse. Also last week, the government banned broadcast interviews with the members of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> and 10 other militant groups in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. To many, the measures smack of victory for the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>: the <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> government abandoning democratic principles throughout <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> as it battles the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s campaign to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. `` To abolish the right to silence is to place a terrible risk against those who are verbally inadequate, those who are afraid, who are simply cautious,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> deputy leader <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hattersley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Denning </PERSON>, who retired in 1982 as <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s most senior judge, retorted: `` The right to silence helps the guilty ... It is only the guilty person who says, ` I am not going to say anything.'''

 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whales such as the three trapped by Arctic ice off <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s northern coast have one of the longest migration routes of all mammals and are among the last of their species. The trapped whales did n't leave in time on the annual migration from the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> to the warm water off <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a journey of 6,000 to 8,000 miles. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whales must leave the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> before winter because they are not adapted for icy conditions and have relatively thin blubber for insulation, said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Whale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. He said the whales also can not break through ice and can not dive underneath ice for any great distance. The whales can only spend an average of three to six minutes underwater at a time during their migration, he said. There used to be three distinct populations of gray whales, including the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> group, another group in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and one on the Asian coast, said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, a marine biologist with the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>House Action Blocked on Sanctions Against Iraq</HEAD>

 House action on sanctions to punish <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for its alleged use of poison gas against the Kurdish minority was blocked early Saturday, and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations chairman blamed manuevering by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members beholden to `` special interests.'' <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> it was `` almost a tragedy'' to allow a handful of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members to bottle up the sanctions bill in the last hours of the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` The will of the majority, the will of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been repudiated,'' he said.

It later went along with a watered-down compromise version originating in the House.

The 83 clashes with `` various rebel groups'' Oct. 1-21 left 110 government troops wounded and six others missing, the radio said.

 A helicopter went to the rescue of three trapped whales Friday, bashing through foot-thick arctic ice with a five-ton concrete `` bullet'' after frustrated workers began hacking an escape route with chain saws. The whales followed the escape route all the way to the 24th breathing hole cut by the workers by Friday night, bringing them a half mile closer to open water now four miles away, said <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>. The Skycrane heavy-lift helicopter loaned by the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> arrived earlier Friday from <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> with a steel-tipped concrete cylinder, a remnant from construction of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline. It finally began punching holes through the ice about 4 p.m. -LRB- 8 p.m. -RRB- EDT, but stopped after about an hour and a half as darkness fell. The helicopter is also creating a series of breathing holes that rescuers hope the whales will follow to open water some four miles away. `` They hover the helicopter 20 feet over the ice, and drop the ` bullet','' <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said. `` It drops through the ice on the second or third try. Then they pull it back out. `` Some of the ice comes with it. They try to pull out as much as possible. The holes _ and I've heard they punched through three or four averaging 15 to 20 minutes per hole _ are about 20 by 30 feet. They're approximately 100 feet apart,'' he said. <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said the helicopter started its ice-bashing near a lead about four miles from the whales. `` We're trying not to scare the whales until the last possible moment,'' he said. `` At last count, they figured it would take 24 to 26 hours if they work continuously. But they have to stop for darkness.'' The young <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whales were imprisoned in shallow water about 100 yards from shore by thickening, shifting ice about two weeks ago. They have been breathing through small holes in the ice about 13 miles northwest of this tiny village on <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s desolate northern coast More than a dozen volunteers decided Friday not to wait for the helicopter and began carving long narrow holes in the ice themselves. `` We're just getting tired of waiting for things to show up,'' said <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Slope </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Borough </LOCATION> biologist <PERSON> Geoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>. `` We're getting away from the heavy equipment approach.'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraker </PERSON>, a whale biologist with <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said rescuers finally were making some progress. `` Up until now, we've just been keeping them alive by keeping their breathing holes open.'' Easterly wind opened leads, or open water, through the ice to within four miles of the whales Friday, giving an added urgency to the effort to free the animals before a shift in the wind could pinch off the escape routes. Biologists already were using tarps and aerators to get the trapped animals away from their breathing holes and condition them to the notion of moving from one hole in the ice to another. Hope faded Friday that a `` hover-barge'' could be used to break ice to rescue the giant mammals. Originally, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> planned to use another Skycrane to tow a 185-ton icebreaking barge, floating on a cushion of air generated by huge on-board fans, from <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Barrow </LOCATION>, a distance of 230 miles. But that bogged down in coastal mud, shallow water, thin ice and sandbars. Two days of pulling had netted six miles. Helicopter crews set out Friday to try one last time to pull the barge. The environmental group <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> on Friday said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has offered to break a path to the stranded whales with an icebreaking ship next week if current rescue efforts do n't succeed. The ship is 300 miles north of <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barrow </LOCATION>. Biologists had been getting impatient with the barge effort and pushed for the alternate plan, using the giant concrete punch. A second concrete cylinder was to be hauled to <PERSON> Barrow </PERSON> later if there was no further progress with the barge. With luck, the animals will follow a series of punched-out holes to open water, if broken ice can be removed from the new holes. `` The theory is to cut other holes very close, but not touching,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> habitat conservation chief for <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. `` You cut a new hole close enough so the whales can see it, sense it and go for it. Once they have done that, and are using the new hole, then you start another process of discouraging use of the older hole. `` There are different ways. One would be to cover the hole, and then even the sounds of chainsaws cutting new holes could get the animals to associate that with new holes. Once you've got them moving, and this has not been decided in this case, then you could move the holes farther apart.'' <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said the whales at least once have been coaxed to a new hole. Skycrane pilot Chief Warrant Officer <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Quarles </PERSON> experimented with one of the concrete cylinders earlier this week. He said the helicopter would suspend the cylinder about five feet above the ice and quickly descend to drop it through. `` It has to be very controlled, or it would be very dangerous,'' he said. `` What we're going to attempt to do initially is make fairly large holes close together in the hope the whales will go from hole to hole,'' he said. `` We plan on putting holes maybe 20 feet apart. My plan is to start fairly far away from them and let them get used to the sound rather than starting close and scaring them. We'll do it gradually.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> announced a tentative agreement Friday on a new labor contract for 17,500 workers in five states. Bargainers had been working against an 11 p.m. Friday strike deadline on an agreement for union workers at <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> plants in the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> cities of <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION>, the only union locals that had not previously reached a tenatative settlement. Details of the agreements were not immediately released. Earlier Friday, <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Local 2096 of <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, with 648 members, announced it had reached a tentative agreement. <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> was the fourth <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> local to reach a tentative agreement with the <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, Ill.-based <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest maker of earthmoving equipment. Contract talks started Aug. 4. Union officials had said those locals without a tentative agreement by the 11 p.m. deadline would be authorized to call a strike. Minutes before the strike deadline, the <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> local reached a tentative agreement, said <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> negotiator <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> local followed suit about an hour later. Union sources earlier said a special job classifications was the main snag in talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> locals in <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION>. Those three locals represent 14,400 of <PERSON> Catepillar </PERSON>'s 17,500 <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> workers. After months of bargaining and two contract extensions, both sides announced Thursday that a tentative agreement had been reached on nearly every key issues, including pay raises and improved health and pension benefits. The locals had objected to the creation of a special job classifications for highly technical jobs because they said it threatened the union's traditional seniority system. Workers trained to fill these high-tech positions could not be bumped from their jobs by untrained workers with more seniority who faced layoff. Company officials maintained, however, that management could not afford to invest in new automated machinery and specialized job training unless it could depend on having those workers remain on the job. <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> locals in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, earlier reached tentative agreements and the <LOCATION> Davenport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, plant is being closed.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, making a long-awaited address to this troubled nation, promised that his military government would lay the foundation for democratic reforms but offered no new policies. Army officials, meanwhile, acknowledged for the first time Friday that a military coup against <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>'s fledgling regime had been thwarted. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>'s speech, broadcast to the nation on state television and radio, was the subject of widespread anticipation because it was the first by the new leader since he assumed power in a military coup one month ago. But the speech lasted only 10 minutes and offered no new policy objectives. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> emphasized that local elections should be held before the country could consider electing a new president. He said Friday that he would propose that `` an independent electoral council be established in the next few days to prepare for county, municipal and legislative elections ... to open the way for presidential elections in a serene atmosphere.'' <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> listed his government's objectives as creating jobs, fighting corruption, promoting investment and bringing an end to violence. `` The national interest demands that an end be put to the violence and agitation which threaten national stability,'' he said. Observers said they saw nothing new in <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>'s remarks. The new leader, who replaced ousted leader Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> in the Sept. 17 coup engineered by rank-and-file soldiers, did not mention a reported coup attempt against his government during the weekend that led to the arrest of 12 soldiers. However, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and Interior Minister Col. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsindil </PERSON> acknowledge the coup attempt Friday evening. `` An attempted coup d' etat led by Sgt. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Beauchard </PERSON> in collaboration with former Lt. Col. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeremie </PERSON> was foiled,'' the communique read. `` The attempt was unmasked in time and certain of their accomplices were arrested.'' Earlier Friday, about 2,000 demonstrators marched from the charred ruins of a slum church to protest a church order to expel an activist priest and called on the government to implement army reforms. The protesters, now in their second week of demonstrations, have been angered by the decision of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s Salesian Order to force the Rev <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s most popular priest, to leave the country The demonstrators waved banners hailing <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> as a `` prophet'' and asked <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> to implement promised reforms, including bringing to justice any remaining <ORGANIZATION> Tonton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macoutes </ORGANIZATION>, the hated secret police that served the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> regime for 29 years. A massacre at Aristide's <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> church </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 11 was cited by the rank-and-file soldiers as a reason for overthrowing <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>. Thugs stormed the church during Mass, killed 12 people, wounded more than 70 others and burned down the building. <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>'s Salesian Order superiors in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> had ordered him to leave <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> by Oct. 17. Friends of the priest said <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> was still in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> on Friday and had not followed up on the transfer order to the St. Claire parish in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> advocates liberation theology, which encourages political activism. The Haitian church hierarchy has accused the priest of preaching violence and class struggle.

<HEAD>Dissident Physicist Credits Recent Reform For Travel Permit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet dissident <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> says the government's approval of his first foreign trip, with visits to as many as six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities next month, is a result of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s recent reforms. The 67-year-old physicist who spent eight years in exile in his own country for human rights campaigning, told a Friday news conference that authorities agreed `` in principle'' to the trip but have not yet issued travel documents. `` I consider that the positive response making my trip possible stems from the very big changes in our country during the last few years,'' said <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, who won the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize for his human rights activities. The lifting of the travel ban against <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, father of the Soviet dissident movement, marked another reversal in <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> policy by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who has liberalized Soviet society on many fronts. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said he plans to attend a meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of a philanthropic group called the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanity </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> is to attend the foundation's board meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Nov. 15-16 and meetings in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and possibly <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said group member <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodgman </PERSON>. The foundation was set up in January to help solve environmental, human rights, disarmament and economic development problems. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> welcomed the Soviet decision but urged <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to give the same permission to all Soviets wishing to travel abroad. `` Soviet use of alleged knowledge of state secrets to deny many other Soviet citizens the right to travel abroad is deplorable and inconsistent with Soviet commitments under the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Accords,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s trip could set an uncomfortable precedent. Hundreds of citizens have been denied permission to travel abroad on grounds they know state secrets. He had been denied permission to travel on grounds he had access to sensitive information while working on the Soviet hydrogen bomb in the 1950s. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> has spoken out repeatedly for free emigration and protested the Soviet intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979. He was exiled to the closed city of <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION> in 1980 and released under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s administration in December 1986. In another sign of his return to good graces of Soviet officials, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was elected one of 47 members to the ruling Presidium of the prestigious academy. During the now-disgraced rule of President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, some academy members tried to expell <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said the academy voted 152-82 to elect him to the Presidium, its leading body. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> now is conducting research in cosmology, the study of the universe's origin. The physicist said his wife, <PERSON> Yelena </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>, would not travel with him but will travel later to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> alone for medical treatment.

<HEAD>Congress Approves Tax Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Congress today completed action on a bill cutting taxes by $ 4.1 billion and increasing the clout of individuals involved in disputes with the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. With only a half-dozen members on the floor, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved the bill by voice vote and sent it to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who, backers predict, will sign it. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had endorsed the compromise a few hours earlier on a 395-1 vote. `` There are thousands and thousands and thousands of people who are going to be beneficiaries and they'll thank us for doing our job,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. Those thousands include farmers, who will be relieved of paying the federal tax on diesel fuel used for off-road purposes and will no longer have to fret with the paperwork caused by the `` heifer tax'' on livestock. Other winners include owners of mutual funds, free-lance writers, workers who receive tuition payments from their employers and families saving for a child's college education. But taxes on other groups will have to go up by $ 4.1 billion over three years to pay for the $ 4.1 billion of selected tax cuts. The losers include pipe smokers, who, for the first time, will have to pay a tax of 45 cents on a pound of their favorite smoking mix; anyone accustomed to writing off part of their basic home phone charge; investors in single-premium life insurance policies, and some corporations, especially those owned by native Alaskans. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> corporations would lose a special benefit that has allowed them to sell operating losses to profitable companies. Lawmakers say the provision has been abused. Negotiators who drafted the final legislation accepted most of the `` taxpayer's bill of rights,'' written chiefly by Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., which is aimed at tipping the scales slightly more toward taxpayers when they face audit or collection actions by the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> These provisions were approved in response to a growing concern among many lawmakers about isolated reports of taxpayers being harassed and intimidated by some <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> employees. In the future, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> would have to fully inform taxpayers of their rights and recourses before any audit or collection steps are taken. The agency would have to give a 30-day notice, compared with 10 days in current law, before seizing property to pay back taxes, and it would be barred from promoting employees on the basis of how much money they collect. The legislation, more than two years in the making, was designed originally to clear up typographical errors and ambiguous wording in the big tax overhaul enacted in 1986. It grew in size as the tax-writing committees tacked on amendments extending some expiring provisions and granting tax benefits for selected groups. A major non-tax provision seizes 540 acres of land adjacent to the <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Battlefield </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> to block construction of a shopping mall on the site. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration opposes this provision, although there has been no indication whether it would prompt a veto. Negotiators, meeting behind closed doors, dropped another unrelated provision, which would have imposed economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to protest that nation's use of poison gas against some of its Kurdish citizens. Major provisions would: _ Exempt from tax interest earned on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> savings bonds that are redeemed to pay for college, starting Jan. 1, 1990 _ Extend expiring tax benefits to help lower-income families buy their first home; reward businesses for increased spending for research and experimentation, and boost incentives for investment in low-income rental housing _ Renew an expired provision that allows workers to exclude from income tuition payments made by their employers; most graduate study would not qualify _ Extend an exclusion for the value of employer-financed legal-service benefits _ Prohibit a business deduction for the basic monthly cost of a home telephone _ Allow free-lance writers, artists and photographers to deduct certain expenses before a project starts producing income _ Permit owners of mutual funds to deduct certain operating expenses of the fund without having to meet a requirement that only miscellaneous expenses exceeding 2 percent of income be deducted The single House vote against the bill was cast by Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>.

 Actor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>, answering critics of his support of the `` bottle bill'' initiative on the Nov. 8 ballot, says being a <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> resident for 14 years gives him the right to speak out on state issues.

 The violence that convulsed <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> earlier this month left 159 people dead and 154 injured, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. Unofficial estimates by medical workers during the uprising that began Oct. 4 in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> put the number of dead at up to 500. Most of the deaths reportedly resulted from troops firing into crowds of demonstrators. The Information Ministry had said 176 died in rioting that spread to <LOCATION> Oran </LOCATION> and other cities. The unrest ended Oct. 12 when the president announced a referendum on reform measures, set for Nov. 3. No explanation was given for the difference in the death estimates. The unrest, spurred by <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s economic crisis, began with demonstrators protesting food shortages and rising prices, and demanding an end to President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON>'s austerity program. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, whose economy is run on a Soviet-style, centrally directed system, has been hurt by the fall in oil prices. About 95 percent of the North African country's income is dervied from oil and gas.

<HEAD>Congress Approves Anti-Drug Bill, Sends Measure To President</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Congress today sent President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> a far-reaching anti-drug bill that one <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leader calls `` bad news for drug dealers and their customers.'' Final passage was delayed until the early morning hours, as conservatives privately demanded anti-obscenity language that was considered unconstitutional by many liberals and moderates. But after negotiators compromised with language to create a new obscenity trafficking offense, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved the bill 346-11 and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> followed suit by voice vote. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote came at 1:20 a.m. EDT and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> acted at 3:15 a.m EDT. The bill contains stiff penalties for drug traffickers and users, and comes just in time for incumbents to trumpet its passage in their re-election campaigns. Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., said the bill is `` bad news for drug dealers and their customers,'' and promised that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would pass `` even tougher medicine'' next year `` This is a very strong bill,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` The message is Do n't do drugs. The country will not tolerate it.'' The bill would fight illegal drugs through law enforcement, stiffer penalties, treatment, rehabilitation, education and aid for authorities in drug-producing countries. The compromise legislation, a product of marathon Senate-House negotiations this week, would send a strong message that even `` recreational'' drug use is unacceptable. The bill would make it possible for those possessing small quantities of drugs intended for personal use to be hit with up to $ 10,000 in civil fines, with the right of court review. Beginning next September those convicted of drug offenses _ including possession could face loss of student loans and other federal benefits for even a possession conviction. Drug kingpins and others who kill or order killings while committing drug-related felonies could themselves be executed under a revitalized federal death penalty. Serious drug offenses would carry stiffer minimum prison terms. Language to strengthen the federal obscenity law was included in the compromise by congressional leaders seeking to avoid a threatened conservative revolt at all costs. Leaders have insisted the bill be acceptable to Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives. Negotiators were unable to resolve disputes _ and thus left out of the final bill _ proposals for random drug testing for transportation workers and those with safety-related jobs at nuclear facilities. The legislation provides about $ 500 million in new spending, which would barely cover a third of the first-year cost of an estimated $ 1.4 billion. The ineligibility for benefits could affect public housing, grants, contracts, loans, mortgage guarantees and some forms of veterans aid _ but not Social Security, Medicare, welfare benefits, veterans disability and other safety-net programs. Judges would have discretion in imposing the penalties after a conviction. The president would submit a report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the program next May, allowing lawmakers to reconsider the proposal before the scheduled September 1989 start of the punishment. The capital punishment provision provides that if someone is killed during a federal drug felony, the death penalty could apply if: the killer was engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise; was trafficking in major amounts of cocaine, heroin or other drugs; intentionally gave an order that resulted in a killing; or killed a police officer. To coordinate the nation's anti-drug policy, a `` drug czar'' would be added to the president's Cabinet. The official would develop plans for every phase of the drug war, share with relevant Cabinet members the authority to transfer personnel and have the right to object when he believes drug funding is inadequate or misdirected. The obscenity trafficking section would allow the government to prosecute those engaged in the business of obscenity, who derive income from their dealings in obscene materials. The traffickers could be forced to forfeit the obscene material and their profits. Other property belonging to them could be seized at a judge's discretion.

 Former Philippine President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> amassed $ 103 million through embezzlement, theft, bribes and kickbacks, funneled it through secret bank accounts and used it to buy valuable real estate, says the grand jury that indicted him. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, 71, and his 59-year-old wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, also defrauded three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lending institutions of $ 165 million in order to buy and finance the properties, according to the racketeering indictment returned Friday. `` This is a plan hatched and begun in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> to move massive amounts of money illegally into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>. `` Then the Marcoses came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and continued their illegal activities.'' Saudi Arabian financier <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON>, a central figure in the secret sale of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, also was indicted. A Washington-based lawyer for the Marcoses, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON>, told a <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> news conference that the couple would plead innocent when arraigned in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> on Oct. 31. `` The charges are false,'' <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> said. Philippine President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who rode to power on a civilian-military revolt that forced <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to flee the country in 1986, welcomed the indictment today and said it would deter other dictators from plundering their countries. `` I hope that this and other similar efforts undertaken in other countries to investigate the crimes of the Marcoses will lead to the early recovery of the stolen assets that rightfully belong to the Filipino people,'' she said in a statement. <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> charged that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> had been given until Thursday to accept or reject a `` drop-dead deal,'' which would have required him and his wife to plead guilty to felony racketeering charges and testify against others _ including family members _ with no assurances they would avoid jail. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> refused to comment on any plea bargain negotiations. <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> suggested that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> promised to indict <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> during negotiations on extending agreements covering <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Under an agreement announced earlier this week, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will pay much less for the bases than the Philippine government first demanded. He expressed concern that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> `` may not be physically able to withstand the rigors of a criminal trial of this scope and magnitude.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> did not attend the news conference. In the 2 -LCB- years he has lived in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, he has been treated for a variety of illnesses, including chest pains. Another <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> lawyer, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tigue </PERSON>, said the Marcoses were `` deeply disappointed'' that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not prevent the indictment. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was saddened by the indictment because <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> `` is an old friend and a friend of the country.'' `` But it's clear that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has a very strong case,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> added. The indictment alleges that the Marcoses illegally amassed $ 103 million through theft, embezzlement, bribes and kickbacks between September 1972, when <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> declared martial law, and his departure in 1986. They allegedly funneled the money illegally through secret bank accounts in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, then used it to buy four commercial buildings at choice <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> locations. Charged with racketeering with the Marcoses were <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON>; <PERSON> Bienvenido </PERSON> <PERSON> Tantoco </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> ambassador to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>; his wife, <PERSON> Gliceria </PERSON>, once the president of a Filipino department store; the Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and its chairman, <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedicto </PERSON>; and the bank's former president, <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aranbulo </PERSON>. The Marcoses, the Tantocos and <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> plotted to conceal the true ownership of the four <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> buildings through false documents, the indictment said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morvillo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON>'s attorney, said <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> `` vehemently denies that he knowingly violated any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law in connection with any dealings he had with Mr. and Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>.'' The six-count indictment also accused the Marcoses of scheming to buy $ 5.9 million in art objects and of transporting money and certain works of art they knew to be stolen. The indictment also charged that the Marcoses and <PERSON> Tantocos </PERSON> defrauded <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of more than $ 165 million to buy one building and refinance others. Each racketeering charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and $ 250,000 in fines.

 Larger-than-usual blood transfusions in recent days have improved Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s anemia, but court officials said today that his kidney and liver functions are worsening. Doctors have stopped using antibiotics to treat the 87-year-old monarch's infected bile duct, said <PERSON> Kenji </PERSON> <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> said only that physicians `` believed it was necessary to do so,'' but news reports quoted palace sources as saying the infection had declined and doctors were concerned about side effects from prolonged use of strong drugs. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> received another transfusion of 0.4 of a pint Friday night, <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> said. That brought the total he has been given since his condition worsened on Sept. 19 to 24 pints _ nearly three times as much as is normally in his body. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> quoted unnamed palace sources as saying the emperor's liver functions were worsening and that the nitrogen level in his blood was three times above normal. Palace officials said the emperor had not discharged any blood for two days, but doctors believed his internal bleeding was continuing.

<HEAD>100th Congress Ends Productive Two-year Run</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, ending a productive two-year run with an early morning flurry of legislative action, sent President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> a compromise bill providing new weapons to fight the war on drugs. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also approved tax adjustment legislation with a three-year price tag of $ 4.1 billion. It upped the ante for Wall Street inside traders, passing legislation to increase fines and prison terms for individual offenders and to penalize investment firms that permit the practice. But efforts to impose economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for poison gas attacks against Kurdish villagers were blocked in the House. Chairman <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said the sanctions bill was bottled up by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members beholden to `` special interests,'' including the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil and agricultural industries. He vowed to try again on sanctions legislation early next year. A struggle to reconcile differences between the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> versions of the anti-drug bill caused <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to abandon plans to adjourn for the year in early October. Many senators, including virtually all of those up for re-election on Nov. 8, had left town and a handful of senators remained to guide the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> through the final hours of the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. All bills were adopted by voice votes. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the anti-drug bill was adopted 346 to 11. The tax adjustment bill passed, 358-1. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> finally adjourned at 3:16 a.m., about 20 minutes after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> closed down. `` The 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> came in like a lion and it is about to go out like a lion,'' said Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, moments before the final gavel Hours before adjournment, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders called President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to announce the end was near. `` The 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is coming to a star-spangled close,'' the president was told by <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> who wore a star-spangled tie for the occasion. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> told reporters they believe the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has compiled the most productive record of any <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 20 years. The drug package would fight illegal drugs through law enforcement, stiffer penalties, treatment, rehabilitation, education and aid for authorities in drug-producing countries. It would make it possible for those possessing small amounts of drugs for `` recreational'' use to be hit with up to $ 10,000 in civil fines and, beginning next September, to face loss of student loans and other federal benefits for even a possession conviction. Murders committed or ordered during drug-related felonies could result in imposition of the death penalty. Serious drug offenses would carry stiffer minimum prison terms. The original purpose of the tax bill was to correct errors in the 1986 tax overhaul. But in its final form the bill does more than that. The agreement carries a $ 4.1 billion price tag over three years and a `` bill of rights'' for taxpayers. More than two years in the making, the legislation now includes tax relief for farmers, free-lance writers, owners of mutual funds, recipients of employer-financed tuition and a variety of other interests. It also includes selected tax increases to pay for those benefits. Pressure to pass the tax bill came mainly from farmers, who would benefit by no longer being required to pay the federal diesel tax and by being allowed to deduct some expenses of producing livestock before the animals generate income. Pressure also came from accountants and other tax professionals, who were seeking corrections for hundreds of errors and ambiguities in the big tax overhaul enacted in 1986. The end of the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> marked the retirement of six senators, including President Pro Tempore <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stennis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, who has been a member of the chamber for 40 of his 87 years. Also retiring are Sens. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis., a 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> veteran; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>, R-Vt.; <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, R-Wash.; <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Trible </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>. Other legislation sent to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Friday included: _ Compromise legislation that would further restrict lobbying by former executive branch officials and apply lobbying restraints to former members of The legislation would bar departing members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from lobbying their former colleagues in either chamber for one year. _ A $ 1.5 billion authorization for <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> flood control and navigation projects in 12 states _ Three House-approved bills aimed at focusing the government's long-range aviation research, boosting the commercial satellite industry and bringing order to federal superconductivity The aviation proposal directs the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to step up its research on aircraft safety, including fire prevention and the problems faced by aging planes. _ A congressional gold medal was authorized to be minted in honor of famed artist <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyeth </PERSON> _ Assorted measures passed by both chambers proclaimed National Jukebox Week, Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, National Lighthouse Day, National Skiing Day, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earthquake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Awareness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Week </ORGANIZATION> and National Asparagus Week _ A measure calling for a memorial honoring women who served in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> _ Legislation ordering the government to ban the sale of lawn darts, a game that is blamed for the deaths of three children and injuries to thousands of others

<HEAD>Students Firebomb USO Facility After U.S. Soldiers And Koreans

 Twenty students hurled firebombs at a USO building after a brawl between <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers, police and news reports said today. No injuries were reported in the attack Friday night on the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, a recreational body for American soldiers based overseas. There also were no damages, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military authorities said, even though one firebomb cleared a fence but missed the building. Guards immediately put out the blaze without incident, the authorities said. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> newspapers said the attack involved 20 slogan-chanting students who hurled about 10 firebombs at the American facility and scattered leaflets demanding the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government apologize for assaults by American soldiers on Koreans. One American soldier and three Koreans were injured last Sunday in a fight involving about 40 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers and 200 Koreans in <LOCATION> Itaewon </LOCATION>, a shopping district close to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military headquarters in southern <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Radicals recently stepped up an anti-U.S. campaign in the aftermath of the Olympics Games, when the actions and manners of some American athletes and the allegedly biased coverage of <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> media during the Sept. 17-Oct. 2 games upset many Koreans Dissidents demand the withdrawal of about 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense pact, contending the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> hampers unification of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula.

<HEAD>Scholars Try Dispelling Myths About African Cults</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANA HAYWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The scholars who gathered this week in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> wanted to explain the appeal of African cults, so they built shrines of drums, wooden skulls and hot peppers as public offerings. `` African religions are not about evil, spilling blood or worshiping devils,'' said Puerto Rican anthropologist <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Alegria </PERSON>, founder of the Center for Advanced Studies for the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. `` If African cults exist today, it's because they are growing. And if there are followers, it's because cults are n't evil,'' <PERSON> Alegria </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Alegria </PERSON> was among anthropologists and sociologists from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> who participated in a weeklong symposium at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Juan </ORGANIZATION> on African religions in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Organizers said the conference, which closed Friday, was the first of its kind. It focused on the religions that branched out in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> after black slaves were brought to the New World by European colonists nearly 500 years ago. `` We hope to bring a better scientific understanding of these religions, why they survive and what role they play in society,'' said <PERSON> Mercedes </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandoval </PERSON>, a social science professor at <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Miami-Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> It's believed up to 200 million people follow some type of African-rooted religion in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, but experts say the numbers could be higher because belonging to a cult is not necessarily information people volunteer. Influenced by Spanish, British, French and Dutch religions, slaves slowly incorporated religious elements of their colonial masters into their own beliefs. For example, <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> islands colonized by the French and Spanish adapted elements of Roman Catholicism, using effigies of saints in their own ceremonies. Initially, slaves used statues of saints as props to hide their own relics from the Europeans. But the two sides fused and today, syncretism, the combination of different beliefs, dominates many African religions. It's common in some places to see a statue of St. <PERSON> George </PERSON> atop his white horse standing next to a horned Exu evil spirit. In English colonized islands, African religions took a more evangelical, <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> tone with less emphasis on religous effigies. Among the religions and cults discussed were abakua, santeria, shango, palomonte, voodoo, and mayombe. Voodoo, it was explained, is not about the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> stereotypes of zombies and sticking pins in lookalike dolls. Widely practiced in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> where Roman Catholicism is the official religion, voodoo is a blend of Catholicism and Indian mysticism, with an emphasis on ancestor worship and harmony with nature. Animal sacrifices play a part in many ceremonies such as <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s candombe and umbanda religions, in which goats and chickens are killed by a `` babaorisha,'' a father of a saint, and offered to holy spirits so they will grant earthlings good fortune. The symposium featured an exhibit of nine altars and shrines displaying the paraphernalia of African rites. The Nigerian altar had a curtain of dry palm leaves protecting holy rocks and bata drums that call spirits or serve as background music to celebrate a saints' birthday. Many shrines had cauldrons stuffed with feathers, wooden skulls, spicy sauces, fruits and herbs. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s exhibit showed the influence of the Yoruba people of <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, who hid their dieties underneath bright satin and beaded mantelpieces.

 One of three trapped whales disappeared under the ice and was presumed dead today, a biologist said only hours after rescuers scored their greatest success in moving the animals closer to open water. The whale named <PERSON> Bone </PERSON> was last seen late Friday afternoon, said <PERSON> Geoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, a North Slope Borough biologist helping lead the effort to rescue the three <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whales. By midnight, <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> and others on the ice near this small town on the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> had given up hope that Bone might rejoin the others. Bone, <PERSON> Crossbeak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bonnet </PERSON> have stuck together since becoming trapped in unseasonably heavy ice more than two weeks ago during their annual migration southward. The missing whale got its name because skin on its snout had been rubbed down to the bone by the rough ice surrounding a breathing hole that kept the mammals alive. That condition may have led to <PERSON> Bone </PERSON>'s death, said biologist <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>. `` Once they get a bone infection, they go pretty quick,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> said. Eskimos led the whales almost a half mile closer to open water earlier Friday by carving a string of 24 breathing holes in the ice away from the main hole the animals had been using. Meanwhile, a helicopter-dropped concrete `` bullet'' bashed a trail from the direction of the open water. About two dozen Eskimo volunteers, many of them bowhead whale hunters, worked about eight hours to cut the 10-by-30-foot holes with chain saws. `` The whales have moved all the way to the 24th hole,'' said Col. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s portion of the rescue effort `` I'm not sure how they did it, but leave it up to <LOCATION> Eskimo </LOCATION> ingenuity.'' De-icers, which keep the holes open by agitating the water, freed the Eskimos to work on new holes. Until two <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> men brought the devices earlier this week, rescuers had spent all their time keeping the original breathing holes from freezing up. Another dozen de-icing devices and a dozen more chain saws were on the way to <LOCATION> Barrow </LOCATION>. A huge CH-54 Skycrane helicopter loaned by the Guard began working toward the whales from about four miles away, so as not to scare the mammals. It used a 5-ton, steel-tipped concrete block suspended from its belly to punch four 15-to-20-foot holes in the ice at 75-yard intervals. `` They hover the helicopter 20 feet over the ice, and drop the ` bullet','' said Spec. 4 <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, a Guard spokesman. `` It drops through the ice on the second or third try. Then they pull it back out.'' A second Skycrane abandoned the repeatedly frustrated effort to tow a 185-ton icebreaking `` hover-barge'' 230 miles from <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, and was to fly to Barrow today to help bash more holes in the ice, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>. The first helicopter began working just inside a troublesome ice ridge that blocks the path to freedom and lies about a quarter-mile from an area of open water leading to the sea. The ridge, formed when drifting pack ice collided with ice anchored on the ocean bottom, is too thick to be punctured by the helicopters, and demolition experts were on their way to assess the situation, said <PERSON> Geoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>. `` We looked for an alternate route -LRB- bypassing the ridge -RRB- and did n't find it,'' <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said. `` If there's no way through it, it will have to be tackled early while the whales still are some ways from it.'' <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has expressed reluctance to use explosives for fear they might harm other marine mammals. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> offered Friday to send an icebreaking vessel now 300 miles miles from Point Barrow to help carve a path for the trapped whales. But <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said water in the area may be too shallow for the vessel. Easterly wind opened leads, or open water, through the ice to within four miles of the whales Friday, giving added urgency to the effort to free them before a shift in the wind could pinch off the escape routes. The whales still would face a 200-mile trek through the leads to reach open sea, and weather forecasts indicate the favorable wind may end this weekend. The whales also have Eskimo names.

<HEAD>Only One in Five Americans Part of Fitness `Boom'</HEAD>

 The fitness movement has bypassed four out of five <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> adults, especially those who are older, have low incomes and are less educated, a new survey says. Only one in five <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> adults gets significant exercise at least twice a week, and 45 percent do n't participate in any fitness activity, according to the survey of 12,500 people commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Lowest rates of participation are among people over 55 years old, those with incomes under $ 15,000 and those lacking college educations, according to the survey. `` You would have had to be living under the proverbial rock to miss hearing about the need for frequent participation in a fitness activity,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON>, research director for the sporting goods group. The scientific evidence linking physical activity to health is growing, according to Dr. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Promotion </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We know that regular exercise can reduce the risk of heart disease and help maintain a healthy weight,'' he said in a statement. `` And it can also make people feel better.'' The survey defined significant exercise as any of seven activities: aerobic exercising, cycling, calisthenics, exercising with equipment, exercise walking, running-jogging and swimming. It did n't say how long each activity must be performed. The survey's findings parallel those of previous studies by the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> and other groups. Inactivity threatens the health of a far greater proportion of Americans than any of the much-publicized evils of smoking, high blood pressure or high blood cholesterol, one researcher said. Yet a sedentary lifestyle can double the risk of a fatal heart attack or stroke, said the researcher, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, an epidemiologist with the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerobics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. `` It's almost the same -LRB- risk -RRB- as for ... smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol,'' he said in a telephone interview Friday. `` An overwhelming majority of the population is not exercising currently at the levels we believe most optimal for health,'' he said. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said he believes people are discouraged by the belief that they must exercise at `` optimal'' levels _ 20 minutes a day, three times a week, at 65 percent of the heart's maximum capacity to pump blood. But latest findings indicate that the highest risks of death from fatal heart attacks or strokes occur only in the most inactive people, and substantial benefits result from activities such as brisk walks and gardening. `` People think you've got to go out and do marathons, triathlons, 10 K's -LRB- 10-kilometer races -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. `` What we need to say is, ` Turn off the TV, do some gardening, take a walk after dinner.''' The survey was conducted by the independent polling organization N.P.D. Research in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points, <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> said. It was released in conjunction with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> trade show running through today in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.

 A storm packing 75 mph winds and 15-foot waves has left at least 10 people drowned and another 700 missing, authorities in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> said today. Residents said they had no warning of the storm that developed suddenly in the Bay of <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION>. Rescue workers today found nine bodies floating in the bay near the island of <LOCATION> Maheskhali </LOCATION>. One person also died in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, where more than 1,000 were injured, officials said. At least 1,500 people had been reported missing Friday, but district officials said today that about 800 were rescued. Authorities said their search was continuing for the other 700, most of them fishermen. The storm struck almost two months after floods inundated much of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, killing at least 1,000 people and leaving homeless about 50 million of this impoverished country's 110 million people.

 This community above the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION>, the northernmost in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, hardly qualifies as a popular fall destination with its below-zero weather, fog and the occasional polar bear roaming the streets. But the drama of efforts to free three ice-trapped whales has turned the Eskimo village into a boom town. `` It feels like this is Grand Central station,'' said <PERSON> Fran </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, owner of <PERSON> Pepe </PERSON>'s North of the Border Restaurant, where business in the past week has been up 20 percent. Hordes of journalists from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> have come to report on the plight of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whales, imprisoned under <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> ice about 13 miles northeast of here for more than two weeks. One of the whales disappeared under the ice Friday and was presumed dead. Residents of this whaling village of about 2,200 people are more accustomed to visits from polar bears that occasionally wander in off the ice pack. But they are taking the attention and the demands of the media in stride. `` We've become something of a nerve center,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON>, manager of the Top of the World Hotel. The 40-room hotel has been fully booked since Oct. 16, and its switchboard has been lit up constantly with calls from people seeking rooms and information about the whales. Another 16-room hotel and all 60 rooms at the former <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> also were filled, <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON> said. `` Right now, we're taking the names of people in town who have space, and we're referring callers to them,'' <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON> said. `` It's all part of the community's response, but we're glad to do it. The impact has spread far beyond the hotels. A special bank of phones was installed in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Slope </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Borough </LOCATION> assembly's chambers Thursday to improve communications, said <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> of the borough's information liaison office. Phone lines in the borough's search-and-rescue operations center had gotten so clogged the rescue squad could n't have received emergency calls had there been any, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. And there is n't a rental vehicle left in town. Enterprising natives are hitching sleds to their snowmobiles to haul reporters, photographers and TV crews across the ice to view the whales. Some reporters went to the operations center to hitch rides to the ice pack on borough and military helicopters involved in the rescue effort, but the center was declared off-limits. Ill-equipped visitors, unfamiliar with the harsh Arctic conditions, have created a run on insulated boots, stocking caps, mittens and other cold-weather gear. Journalists also like to eat well. `` They're bigger spenders because they're on expense accounts,'' said <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, who bills her establishment as `` the farthest <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> restaurant.'' Asked if she thought the media response was out of proportion to the situation, <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said, `` Well, maybe just a little bit. But what's wrong with caring?'' <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said the coverage will show the compassion the Eskimos feel for whales despite their hunting heritage. The Eskimos hunt bowhead whales, not <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> grays.

 The story of three trapped whales and efforts to save them from an icy death has generated sympathy across the nation and around the world. The struggle against time and thickening Arctic ice has gripped <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> schoolchildren, made front-page news in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and gained extensive coverage by Soviet television news. `` It's the kitten in the tree syndrome. If a kitten gets caught, everybody gathers around to rescue it,'' said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cetacean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` We ca n't do much about Japanese whale hunters, ocean pollution and gill nets. But here are three whales that maybe we can save,'' Ms. <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. A combination of early ice and shifting winds trapped the three <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whales more than two weeks ago near the northernmost tip of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Part of an endangered species, the giant mammals feed in northern waters before migrating past <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to breed in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Rescuers hope to free them by pulverizing a path through four miles of ice. They succeeded in drawing the whales nearly a half mile to open water with a string of holes Friday, but one of the mammals disappeared later in the day and was presumed dead. Television has delivered daily scenes of the struggling whales emerging to breathe every two minutes, their battered, barnacle-encrusted snouts rubbed to the bone by jagged ice. `` It's a very powerful emotional scene,'' said <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> of the Friends of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, an environmental group in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` We're not dealing with a bunch of fish. This is a mammal of extraordinary intelligence that has been extraordinarily hunted and persecuted.'' Their plight is a teaching tool in classes such as <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>'s kindergarten at <ORGANIZATION> Fremont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` Little children love anything big,'' Ms. <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> said. `` They're very concerned about how the whales got trapped and why they need to come up to breathe. They're aware these animals have a right to live. They're fascinated by them. `` They want them to survive. They do n't want them to be hurt.'' The drama has produced a wave of support from well-wishers, including a telephone pep talk from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to chilled rescuers. Some have suggested using explosives, rock salt and bowling balls to defeat the ice. `` We get calls and calls and calls,'' said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingall </PERSON>, director of ocean ecology for the environmental group <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>. `` A lot of people are phoning for information or to see if there's anything they can do to help. One suggestion paid immediate dividends. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrian </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Skluzacek </PERSON>, two brothers-in-law from <LOCATION> Lakeland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, flew to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> at their own expense Wednesday to use their de-icing machines to enlarge the whales' air pockets. The frozen theater has been front-page news in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, where TV newscasts play whale clips prominently. Soviet coverage has been unusually extensive, with the nightly news program Vremya carrying reports every day. Some Muscovites say the rescue attempts give them a good impression of Americans' concern for life, more than any disarmament initiatives <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television network was more tongue-in-cheek. Its report Thursday night said the `` Walkampf,'' a German compound meaning whale struggle, had upstaged the presidential `` Wahlkampf,'' the German word for election campaign. Pronunciation of the two words is identical. And one South African whale expert was skeptical about the rescue effort. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Best </PERSON> of the South African Museum in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> said in an interview published Friday that the rescue effort `` is all very humanitarian and noble, but it makes nonsense out of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> funding for -LRB- maritime -RRB- research,'' which he said has been slashed. Gray whales were hunted to near extinction by the 1920s, when their numbers dipped to below 1,000 while their skins were used for buggy whips and corsets and their teeth fashioned into ivory jewelry. Environmentalists now estimate their population at about 20,000.

 Defense Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> says Americans must get over their fear of selling arms to Arab countries, or risk losing ground to other countries with the weapons and the will to step in. `` <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and others are moving into the highly desirable positions of confidence and influence which <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has traditionally enjoyed with friends such as <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. `` I see tens of billions of dollars worth of jobs going abroad instead of sustaining our key defense industries and bolstering the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. economy.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, speaking Friday at an American-Arab relations seminar at <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said the threat to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would be greater if <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> countries look to other nations to supply arms. `` The notion that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense cooperation with moderate <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states poses a danger to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is ill-founded and untrue,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> must regard non-American arms in the hands of its neighbors as a higher risk.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has rejected major arms sales to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> warned lawmakers that the denial poses a greater threat militarily in the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> and economically in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fouad </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Farsy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s deputy minister of information, said earlier in the seminar that his country, like other moderate neighbors of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, should not be treated as the enemy due to its longstanding relationship with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` In the last 15 years, in the development of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, we have looked to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> for leadership, guidance ... and manpower,'' <PERSON> Al-Farsy </PERSON> said. The international president of B'nai B'rith, a Jewish civic and fraternal organization, said the group was dismayed to hear that <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> `` defined <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> arms sales policy in terms of dollars and cents. `` If the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wanted primarily to earn monetary profit on weapons sales, this country could sell arms to all sorts of dictatorial and totalitarian regimes around the world,'' said <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>. `` However, the cornerstone of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales policy has always been to examine first and foremost the strategic and moral implications of military sales,'' <PERSON> Reich </PERSON> said. `` In the case of arms sales to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has always chosen the wise course of supporting its most reliable ally in the region, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Reich </PERSON> said. `` This has meant, and rightly so, denying sophisticated weapons to those nations who _ in defiance of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy which seeks advancement of the peace process _ continue to declare themselves to be in a state of war with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s steadfast partner in strategic cooperation, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and <PERSON> Al-Farsy </PERSON> agreed on the need for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to meet face-to-face to negotiate peace in the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION>, but had differing conditions for how to get them talking. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> first needs to renounce terrorism and agree that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has a right to exist. `` Palestinian participation is required at every stage of negotiations concerning the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, since the outcome will affect their interests and will bear directly on their future as a people,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. `` Without their active participation, no agreement can be expected to endure.'' <PERSON> Al-Farsy </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not set itself up as an `` honest broker'' then take <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s side on every question. `` There can be no chance for peace if one side will not talk to the other. To them, progress is the lack of progress,'' <PERSON> Al-Farsy </PERSON> said of the Israelis. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is stubborn because it knows the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will support her no matter what position she takes.''

 A shootout on the midway of the State Fair left one dead and three wounded, including a police sergeant who was shot in the hand as he grappled with gunman, authorities said today. Two other officers were hurt in scuffles, and numerous bystanders were knocked down or trampled late Friday and early today as thousands fled the scene of the gunfight just outside the Cotton Bowl. Police were trying to determine what triggered the violence. The shooting followed a brawl between black and Hispanic fair-goers, said police Cpl. D.H. Boy. Police Sgt. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON> was in stable condition at <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where he underwent surgery, said <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, a nurse at the hospital. The man who police said shot <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON> died of multiple gunshot wounds, Ms. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said. His name was not released. The incident apparently began around 11:45 p.m. with a shooting in a fair restroom, said police Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Holt </PERSON>. An officer who overheard the shot chased two or three people through the midway crowd and found the sergeant, the gunman, and another man struggling on the ground, said <PERSON> Holt </PERSON>. A gunbattle ensued between the pursuing officer and the gunman, the captain said. Two other men were shot in addition to the gunman and the sergeant, he said. One was shot in the restroom and the other on the midway. Both were in serious condition, one with a chest wound, the other with a back wound, said a <ORGANIZATION> Parkland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> nurse who declined to give her name. Thousands of people headed for exits when the shooting broke out. Seven pregnant women were treated for injuries or premature labor caused by the fair-goers' stampede. Five other people were trampled or bruised in the crush. <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON>, 17, said she and a friend tried to climb a six-foot chain link fence to escape the gunfire, but she could not make it because she is seven months pregnant. She and her friend soon were engulfed by the crowd. `` We were both crying and holding each other and did n't know what to do,'' Ms. <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> said while waiting for hospital care. `` Then she fainted.'' <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>, 37, of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, was high above the midway on the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> ferris wheel when the shooting began. `` I heard two or three shots and people in the center _ in the middle _ started running in every direction,'' <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> said. `` After that, you could see people in different spots just running like crazy _ just getting away from this area.''

 <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, who has been indicted in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal, says reporters were corrupted by ambitious prosecutors who leaked information to them. `` By the time I was indicted I was already convicted,'' said <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, who is accused of taking payoffs from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> officials in exchange for influencing the awarding of government contracts. `` I am an innocent man caught in this system,'' <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Managing Editors convention Friday. `` And you, every one of you, no matter how well-intentioned, played a part in it.'' <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> lawyer who goes to trial Jan. 3 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on federal racketeering and conspiracy charges, also accused reporters of slanting their articles by overlooking his record as a respected litigator. Also speaking at the convention were former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON>, retired managing editor of The Indianapolis News. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> told the newspaper editors they crossed the line between the public's right to know and an invasion of privacy in covering her bid for the vice presidency in 1984. When reporters were finished interviewing everyone they could find, including a janitor in a school where she once taught, `` they found nothing newsworthy,'' she said. `` I was what I said I was ... so they had to go after my family,'' she said, referring to her husband's business dealings. <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON> was the one who made a telephone call on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> when <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> wanted to join the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> years ago. <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON> assailed his peers Friday for letting what he called an editor's mistake stick. `` I'm here as a defendant after being tried in the kangaroo court in which some of you participated,'' the former <ORGANIZATION> APME </ORGANIZATION> president said. He said he was belittled, maligned, misquoted and harrassed after the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> picked up a story from <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> that suggested <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON> made many calls on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s behalf. `` I made one call to one person,'' <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON> said. The AP corrected the story, but <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON> said he was hounded for weeks by newspaper reporters from around the country who continued to base their reports on the erroneous information. `` How much are editors responsible for the pushiness of their reporters?'' he said. `` Ours is an honorable profession,'' <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON> said. `` Please let's keep it that way.''

 A three-year probe that led to the indictments of a retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> colonel and a defense contractor is likely to produce more charges, a federal prosecutor said. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and its predecessor, <ORGANIZATION> Sperry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, are each accused of falsely billing the government for more than $ 500,000 for work that was never performed as part of a $ 526 million contract to modernize the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s computer network, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said Friday. Retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON>, 51, of <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> is accused of negotiating a consulting job with <PERSON> Sperry </PERSON> while he was overseeing the contract, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said more indictments are expected from the investigation. <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON> was indicted Wednesday and the companies on Tuesday. <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON>' Washington-based attorney, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, said his client was innocent and would defend himself vigorously. `` His decisions regarding his post-retirement activities were done in full accordance with the law and with the knowledge and understanding of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hynes </PERSON>, a spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>' office in <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said `` neither -LRB- Hedges -RRB- nor <PERSON> Sperry </PERSON> did anything wrong.'' <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> is the product of the 1986 merger of <LOCATION> Sperry </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said that is why both companies were named in the indictment A statement released by <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> said the company `` was disappointed that, after more than three years of cooperation with the government, an indictment would be brought relating to the alleged falseness of one invoice of a predecessor company.'' <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Agricola </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney handling the case, said investigators had not determined whether <PERSON> Sperry </PERSON> might have received favorable treatment in exchange for a consulting job <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON> took after he left the service in August 1984. `` Under the statute, it did n't have to. Just the conflict being there is required,'' said <PERSON> Agricola </PERSON>. In June 1984, <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON> signed a $ 75,000 consulting contract with Sperry while on leave from the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hynes </PERSON> confirmed that <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON> did work for <PERSON> Sperry </PERSON> after leaving the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. He said <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON> is still under contract with <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sperry </PERSON> was awarded the eight-year contract in January 1983. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON> oversaw the program from <ORGANIZATION> Gunter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>. Prosecutors said <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> remains eligible for defense contracts, although Col. <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Benham </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s investigations division said the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> could decide otherwise. If convicted, <PERSON> Sperry </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> each could face $ 50,000 fines plus restitution to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON> could be fined $ 10,000 if convicted.

 <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> accompanied <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> today on <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s first visit to the kingdom since King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> severed links last July with the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> greeted the leaders at the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Aqaba </LOCATION>, 175 miles south of the capital <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, state <ORGANIZATION> Jordan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, reached by telephone from <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> are trying to agree on a formula for a confederation between <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and a future independent Palestinian state. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a sort of parliament-in-exile, is due to meet in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> on Nov. 12-14 to declare Palestinian independence in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which have been wracked by a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising against Israeli rule since Dec. 8. `` <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> believes that it -LRB- the council -RRB- will be successful only if it also states clearly what relations the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state will have with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>,'' one <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official said. The radio said among those gathered for today's talks were Prime Minister <PERSON> Zaid </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Taher </PERSON> <PERSON> Masri </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON> and three of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s senior aides, <PERSON> Hani </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Hassan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Milhem </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said in an interview published Thursday in the Egyptian daily <ORGANIZATION> Al-Ahram </ORGANIZATION> that `` the next few days'' would witness `` a consolidation'' of the Arab side in possible peace talks with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` It is now for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to make up its mind and declare that it opts for peace and is ready to accept the obligations peace entails,'' he said. The tripartite summit comes a little more than a week before a crucial Israeli election pitting the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which favors negotiating a partial withdrawal from the occupied territories, against the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, which opposes territorial compromise. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said Thursday in an interview with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> network <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> that a <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> victory would be `` an absolute disaster'' and said the peace proposals of Labor leader <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> were a `` step forward.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has not visited <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> since the outbreak of pro-PLO rioting in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which once again propelled the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to the center of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> stage. In July, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> formally renounced his claims to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> ruled until Israeli occupation in 1967. The move challenged the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to set up a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state in the occupied lands. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said he took the move in compliance with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> wishes. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials generally welcomed the move but expressed irritation they were not consulted in advance and some indicated suspicion <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> was trying to pressure the organization. `` It's no secret that there's distrust between the king and the chairman -LRB- <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> -RRB-,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official from <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. `` But both trust <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>. He can be a good guarantor.'' <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials say the <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is likely to declare independence for the occupied territories that include <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, which was ruled by <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> before its occupation in 1967. It may also establish a provisional government that could take part in peace talks. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials say the council may formally, but implicitly, endorse <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist by accepting the 1947 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> partition resolution that split Palestine into Arab and Jewish states. At least 301 Palestinians and six Israelis have died in the 10-month uprising in the occupied territories.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> can not tell a jury that charges against him were politically motivated without a hearing that could delay his perjury trial until after the Nov. 8 election, a judge ruled. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> accused <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> of scheming against him for political gain on Friday. He also charged that the government deliberately timed his 10-count indictment shortly before the election. `` They wanted to make darn good and well -LRB- sure -RRB- that they got the indictment before Nov. 8, 1988,'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> said of prosecutors. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vining </PERSON>, who began screening potential jurors Friday, ruled that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> may not raise his allegations to the jury without a hearing that could delay his trial until after the election. Barring such a delay, jury selection could be completed and opening arguments in the trial could begin Monday. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> told <PERSON> Vining </PERSON> he would pursue the hearing process `` if it does n't unnecessarily delay the trial,'' but lead prosecutor <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillen </PERSON> immediately served notice he would seek time to prepare a written response to any such move. <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> also said he plans to be on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> next week for legal conferences. <PERSON> Vining </PERSON> said <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> would be free to raise the issue Monday morning. Outside the courtroom, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> declined to comment on his plans. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, a two-term Republican representing the 4th Congressional District of suburban <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, faces Democrat <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> in the election. As he unsuccessfully sought to subpoena <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> to testify at the trial, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> contended it is no accident that he was indicted shortly before the election. He accused <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> _ who, like <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, is a Republican _ of contacting officials in Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential campaign to assess the political impact of his investigation. One of those officials, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, deputy director of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Southern campaign, confirmed he talked with <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> on the day <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was indicted but denied ever having discussed the <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> case with <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> declined comment, citing the pending trial. Later, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> said he would subpoena reporters for The <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Journal-Constitution and <ORGANIZATION> WSB-TV </ORGANIZATION>, two news organizations which this summer obtained transcripts or videotapes of secretly recorded meetings between <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> and an undercover investigator. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> would not disclose what he wants to ask the reporters on the witness stand, and questioned whether they can legally be compelled to reveal the source of their stories about the recorded conversations. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON>, described by prosecutors as the middleman in the loan negotiations which led to the charges against <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, pleaded guilty to five violations of federal currency laws. LeChasney admitted to charges which do not mention <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, but involve the money-laundering `` sting'' investigation that eventually included a proposed $ 850,000 home mortgage loan for the congressman. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kish </PERSON>, <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON>'s lawyer, said he did not know if his client would be called as a prosecution witness against <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>. <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON> was a participant in meetings with <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> and an undercover agent posing as a financier. The government contends that the agent told <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> his proposed loan from LeChasney would be backed by illegal drug proceeds and that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> perjured himself by denying that to a grand jury. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> has said <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON> misled him and that he did not intentionally deceive the grand jury. LeChasney could be sentenced to 30 years in prison and fined $ 1.5 million, but under a plea agreement, federal prosecutors agreed to recommend lesser sentences if he testifies truthfully in all related cases. Five related charges will be dropped under the plea bargain. <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON> also agreed to repay $ 17,500 in government funds which he had converted to his own use.

 No courtroom reunions were planned to mark the anniversary of one of the nation's longest trials. But jurors in the case, which involved less than a teaspoon of dioxin, look back a year ago today and sigh with relief. `` I do n't think I'll ever forget when it started and when it ended _ especially when it ended,'' said <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cumer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, a 39-year-old telephone technician who served as jury foreman in the case known as <PERSON> Kemner </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION>. `` The guys at work tease me,'' he said. `` They call me the lawyer.'' After nearly four years of testimony and 38 days of deliberation, the jury decided on Oct. 22, 1987, that the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> owed more than $ 16 million to 65 people in <LOCATION> Sturgeon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, because of a chemical spill in 1979 during a train derailment. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>, who was dismissed from the jury just 45 minutes before it got the case, said she remains bitter. Mrs. <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>, 50, was dismissed by <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldenhersh </PERSON> for a conflict of interest after being part of the jury for more than three years. `` I hold a grudge,'' said the mother of five, who works as a sales clerk. `` And I still get teary-eyed when I think about it _ and I will for years.'' The panel awarded the plaintiffs $ 16.2 million as punitive damages, but gave 63 of them only $ 1 for compensatory damages. It awarded two plaintiffs $ 14,500 each to compensate for property damage. The <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> residents said they were hurt when the train derailed in Sturgeon and a 19,000-gallon load of wood preservative containing less than a teaspoon of dioxin spilled along the tracks. <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> contended the amount of dioxin was too small to cause the fatigue, headaches, joint pains, high blood pressure, nausea and other ills claimed by the plaintiffs. Dioxin, an unwanted byproduct created during the manufacture of some herbicides and pesticides, is known to cause brain, heart and genetic damage in laboratory animals. The health risk to humans remains subject to debate. The case, which generated 113,000 pages of court records alone, is on appeal, said <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Snively </PERSON>. Attorneys on both sides agreed it would take another year, possibly two, before the case is settled. `` If I had to do it again, I'd try to get out of it,'' Mrs. <PERSON> McCann </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think anything should go that long.'' <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Seigfried </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, who represented the plaintiffs with attorney <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Belleville </LOCATION>, called his participation `` a very interesting experience.'' He said he had no regrets about taking the case, tried in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> because <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> manufactured the wood preservative at its <LOCATION> Sauget </LOCATION> plant. `` It was part of the job,'' he said. `` It's what I do.'' But like the jurors, <PERSON> Snively </PERSON> breathed a sign of relief that the trial phase was over. The length of the trial was `` physically tough on everybody _ the stress, the fatigue,'' <PERSON> Snively </PERSON> said. `` After it's over, everybody tends to gain a little bit of weight. `` It's just good to see your kids and family on a regular basis,'' he said.

 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> today welcomed the indictment of <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> racketeering charges, saying it would hasten recovery of the billions of dollars plundered during his 20-year rule. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, in a statement, said she hopes the prosecution in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> of her predecessor will serve as a deterrent to other dictators who steal from their countries and then seek asylum abroad. `` This -LRB- indictment -RRB- is certainly welcome news in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and I commend this evident commitment to the rule of law abroad,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has been living in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> since he fled the country during the February 1986 civilian-military revolt that swept Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> invited <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to take up residence in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> claims in a lawsuit filed in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> that he was deceived into leaving the country against his will. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, are restricted to the island of <LOCATION> Oahu </LOCATION> because of his reported attempt last year to return to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are honoring a <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government request that he not be allowed to return. On Friday, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government indicted former President <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, his wife and eight associates on charges of racketeering. They could face 20-year prison sentences if found guilty. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was the highest-ranking former foreign official indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The charges alleged that between September 1972, when <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> declared martial law in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, and 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Marcoses </ORGANIZATION> amassed $ 103 million through embezzlement, theft, bribes and kickbacks. According to the indictment, the Marcoses illegally funneled the money through secret bank accounts in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and then used the money to buy valuable <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> properties. `` I hope that this and other similar efforts undertaken in other countries to investigate the crimes of the Marcoses will lead to the early recovery of the stolen assets that rightfully belong to the Filipino people,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government has accused the Marcoses of stealing up to $ 10 billion in public and private assets during <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' rule. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> formed the five-member <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Good Government to try to recover the wealth and bring the Marcoses to trial. The commission's former chairman, <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trial will save the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> time in efforts to recover assets. `` A lot of evidence that we would have to present before the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts -LRB- to recover <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> property -RRB- will already have been presented,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION>, Swiss authorities have ordered records on some Swiss financial transactions made by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, saying those records can be turned over to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Aquino government alleges that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his associates stashed much of their funds in Swiss banks. Swiss authorities put that figure at at least $ 1 billion. But <PERSON> Beat </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Rechenberg </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' Swiss lawyer, said he would `` most probably'' file an appeal with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.

 A girl was missing today after an Italian freighter rammed a Greek cruise ship carrying 475 British students and teachers, causing the cruise ship to sink, officials said. Two seamen were killed. At least 64 people, including 30 students, were injured Friday evening when the Adige freighter tore a gaping hole in the 6,300-ton Jupiter, which was steaming out of <LOCATION> Piraeus </LOCATION> harbor. Two remained hospitalized today. Screaming children jumped from the listing ship into oil-covered waters before the vessel sank less than an hour after the collision. A British Embassy official said the 14-year-old girl, <PERSON> Vivienne </PERSON> <PERSON> Barley </PERSON>, was the only person still unaccounted for. A <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said radio appeals were broadcast `` for anyone who may have seen her or picked her up to contact us.'' Frogmen and <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials searched the area where the Epirotiki Lines cruise ship sank less than a mile from <LOCATION> Piraeus </LOCATION> harbor on the start of an eight-day educational cruise. `` The Italian ship tore a huge hole below the waterline, almost splitting the Jupiter in two ... no wonder it sank in less than an hour,'' said <PERSON> Spyros </PERSON> <PERSON> Mavrikis </PERSON>, an Epirotiki spokesman. Greek Prime Minister <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, looking fit and well after major heart surgery in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, flew to <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> today promising a full investigation into the collision. At the time of the accident, the 415 teen-agers and their 60 teachers and helpers were on a trip to Greek islands and ports in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. `` I was sitting with my friends in the lounge when we looked out of the window and saw this ship coming straight towards us,'' said 14-year-old <PERSON> Kirsty </PERSON> <PERSON> Spurling </PERSON>, a pupil at the Sacred Heart of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> convent school at <LOCATION> Havering </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. `` We all screamed, there was a bang and the boat began to tilt ... I said a prayer,'' she said. As the cruise ship listed, screaming youngster jumped overboard into the oily waters of <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>' main port. Others were thrown into the sea by the force of the swell as the vessel sank. Dozens of <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> launches and tug-boats rushed to the rescue, but there were conflicting views as to how the survivors managed to escape the vessel. `` The ship tilted at a terrible angle and very quickly. We were all told to get out of the boat and climb up as high as we could,'' said <PERSON> Grahame </PERSON> <PERSON> Addecott </PERSON>, an English teacher at the Sacred Heart of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> school. `` On deck we were told to hang onto the rails and it seemed forever until the crew helped us down into the rescue boat ... some of my girls were very frightened,'' he said. Some students said crew members chose to abandon ship rather than help the students into boats. `` The crew all got out leaving us there to look after ourselves,'' said <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stavrou </PERSON>, 16, from <LOCATION> Dunster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Close </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Romford </LOCATION>. `` I did n't see any of the crew after we got out on deck.'' Weeping, oil-splattered children and teachers clung to each other as they boarded buses bound for hospitals in the <LOCATION> Piraeus </LOCATION> area. Four passengers were reported to have fractures and one underwent surgery for abdominal injuries, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The rest of the group was taken aboard another <ORGANIZATION> Epirotiki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> cruise ship berthed in <LOCATION> Piraeus </LOCATION> _ the <LOCATION> Pegasus </LOCATION> _ for the night. The tour company Schools Abroad, which coordinated the trip for 13 schools across <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, said charter jets were flying the group home today. The first of four planes with 140 people aboard, some still wrapped in blankets, took off from <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> just before 1 p.m. <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials identified the two dead seamen as <PERSON> Vassilis </PERSON> <PERSON> Psomas </PERSON>, 22, and <PERSON> Athanasios </PERSON> <PERSON> Golemotis </PERSON>, both from the Jupiter's 120-member crew. <PERSON> Golemotis </PERSON>' age was not available. Merchant Marine Minister <PERSON> Evangelos </PERSON> <PERSON> Yannopoulos </PERSON> said the Italian ship was to blame and its skipper, Capt. <PERSON> Flavio </PERSON> <PERSON> Caminale </PERSON>, was arrested on manslaughter charges. The Adige, a container ship owned by <ORGANIZATION> Sicula </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spa </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Siosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Line </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>, was transporting automobiles to <LOCATION> Piraeus </LOCATION> and hit the Jupiter while maneuvering toward the dock.

 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> announced today it will release 25 Iranian prisoners of war in accordance with a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution, the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. The agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, quoted an unidentified spokesman of the <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> as saying the unilateral decision was relayed to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. The spokesman was quoted as saying the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> was asked to disptach a delegation to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> `` to take the neccessary measures to repatriate the POWs.'' On Thursday, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> rejected an <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> plan for repatriating prisoners of war from the eight-year <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> conflict and said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> must accept the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan for ending the war before prisoner exchanges could start. The Iraqi spokesman was quoted as saying with the latest batch, the total number of sick and aging Iranian prisoners released by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> `` for purely humanitarian reasons, with no political conditions attached'' reached 645. He called on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to reciprocate, adding <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> `` would be held fully responsible for any delay in ending the sufferings of the POWs and their families,'' the news agency reported. He said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> `` has all along dealt with the POWs issue as a political one, in order to exploit it for the puposes of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s expansionist policies. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has 50,182 prisoners and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has 19,284 prisoners. But <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials and diplomats in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> believe <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> holds 60,000 to 70,000 POWs and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> 30,000 to 50,000. U.N. Resolution 598 calls for an immediate cease-fire, withdrawal of troops to internationally recognized boundaries and the exchange of prisoners. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> this week proposed to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> that repatriation of prisoners should begin on humanitarian grounds if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> reciprocates. But <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> also made it clear its offer was unrelated to peace negotiations, which stalled five days after a cease-fire was declared on Aug. 20. The peace talks have deadlocked over <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s insistence that the disputed Shatt-al-Arab waterway, which forms its southern border with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, should be cleared of silt and ships sunk early in the war. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has rejected the dredging demand, saying it is a secondary issue that can be settled later in the negotiations.

 Israeli warplanes flew over the ancient city of <LOCATION> Baalbek </LOCATION> in east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, police said today, fueling fears of an imminent attack on the main stronghold of pro-Iranian extremists. The rare nighttime overflights came hours after Israeli fighter-bombers attacked other <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> and pro-Iranian guerrilla bases to avenge the killing Wednesday of seven <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers in a suicide car bombing. Shiite Moslem kidnappers holding at least two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hostages charged Friday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> gave advance approval to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to strike at the guerrilla strongholds, and the kidnappers threatened to harm the hostages. <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, a Shiite Moslem leader, said today that the kidnappers of the hostages committed an `` unforgivable crime'' by threatening to harm them. <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, who heads the mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia, spoke in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>'s Syrian-backed militia has been locked in a fierce struggle with pro-Iranian fundamentalists for mastery of the Shiite community, and, therefore, has no influence on the kidnappers. Police in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> said today that the death toll from the Israeli air raids climbed to 16 when a wounded person died. Thirty-four were hurt in the attack. Police said sonic booms jolted the population of <LOCATION> Baalbek </LOCATION> out of their beds late Friday night and early this morning when the Israeli jets crashed the sound barrier in several low-altitude runs over <LOCATION> Baalbek </LOCATION>. `` They've seldom done such a thing since the 1982 invasion,'' said a police spokesman. `` People are afraid their city will be the next target for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s retaliation to the suicide bombing.'' <LOCATION> Baalbek </LOCATION> is controlled by the Iranian-backed fundamentalist group that is believed to be the umbrella for kidnappers of the 14 foreigners in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. An estimated 3,000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards are based at the <ORGANIZATION> Sheik </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abdullah </ORGANIZATION> barracks on a hilltop overlooking the city that harbors ancient Roman ruins. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> said victims of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s retaliatory raid were to be buried today in a mass funeral in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> valley town of <LOCATION> Mashgara </LOCATION>. The air raids hit positions near <LOCATION> Mashgara </LOCATION> and the port city of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. Israeli officials often charge that <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> cooperate in guerrilla warfare against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops and allied militiamen in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> pulled most of its army from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in June 1985 after a three-year occupation and carved out the six-to-10-mile security zone to prevent guerrilla infiltration into its northern settlements. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had vowed to retaliate for Wednesday's bombing, the deadliest attack against Israelis in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 2 -LCB- years. `` Committing this stupidity and this attack shall not pass without a punishment,'' said a typewritten statement in Arabic signed Friday by <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jihad </ORGANIZATION>, the pro-Iranian faction holding <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and educator <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>. The statement, delivered to the independent <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspaper An-Nahar hours after the attack, praised the Shiite Moslem suicide car bomber. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, was abducted in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on March 16, 1985. <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, 56, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Collins </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, was acting dean of agriculture at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> when he was abducted on June 9, 1985. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> are among nine Americans believed held by pro-Iranian extremist factions linked to <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. The statement accused the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration of giving <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> advance approval to attack <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing. <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>, considered to be <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s spiritual leader, said he would do his best to protect the hostages. `` We continue to respect our previous commitments to defend human rights in order to see these hostages free and safe as soon as possible,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Cadiz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON>, asked his captors to `` recognize that <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> is totally innocent and has never been involved in the continuing <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> strife except as a captive for 3 -LCB- years.'' Friday's statement was the first since Aug. 18, when the group said none of its hostages would be released soon.

 Chinese newspapers published a reader's letter urging leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> to launch an anti-smoking campaign by kicking the habit himself, a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> newspaper reported Saturday. Policeman <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Jianxin </PERSON> wrote that by smoking in public, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> encouraged thousands of Chinese to keep smoking, the independent Chinese-language Ming Pao reported, quoting the <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The news agency was quoted as saying <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> gave the letter prominent play and that it also ran in the Hygiene Newspaper. Chinese media traditionally do not criticize <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON>, of the northwest <LOCATION> Xinjiang </LOCATION> province, said he hoped <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> will quit for his and the Chinese peoples' health. The agency said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> produced 40 billion packs of cigarettes annually and 250 million people smoke. It said of the 32,000 fires last year, more than half were caused by careless smokers.

 Kidley Street seems too quiet to be a battleground. But Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> are skirmishing there and throughout <LOCATION> Macomb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and throughout the nation for the votes of so-called <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Democrats. The county's predominantly white, middle-class voters bolted to <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1980 and 1984 while they supported Democratic candidates on most of the ballot _ as did many Democrats elsewhere in the country. Macomb is `` an absolute 100 percent predictor of how <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s going to vote,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Neel </PERSON>, whom the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> sent here in August to run a storefront <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign office in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shores </LOCATION> `` And without <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, we're not going to win.'' <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilsenan </PERSON> of <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, a Republican district chairman, agrees. `` If you do n't carry -LRB- Macomb -RRB- county, you do n't carry the state,'' he said. Bordering predominantly black <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> on the north and mainly white, affluent <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> on the east, <LOCATION> Macomb </LOCATION> and its 700,000 residents are what <PERSON> Neel </PERSON> calls `` a microcosm of the country.'' Auto industry factories and rows of bungalow houses crowd Eight Mile Road, the county's southern border. Farther north are large homes, apartment buildings, condominiums and newer factories, and beyond them are mobile home parks and new subdivisions. A dwindling number of farms and small towns are found in <LOCATION> Macomb </LOCATION>'s northernmost reaches. On <LOCATION> Kidley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, the middle-class, dual-income <PERSON> Zaleski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tremaine </PERSON> families are linked by their sons, <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaleski </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tremaine </PERSON>, who are pals at <ORGANIZATION> Adlai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stevenson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. But their parents' divergent political leanings reflect the challenge facing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` I do n't think my luck has increased through the Republican administrations,'' said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaleski </PERSON>, a carpenter who voted for Democrats <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in 1980 and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> in 1984. `` I do n't think I've made many great strides,'' he said. `` I've got to run like hell just to keep up with things. <PERSON> Zaleski </PERSON> plans to cast an unenthusiastic vote for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` He's the lesser of two evils The Democrats at least do try to help the working man,'' he explains. <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Tremaine </PERSON>, a computer programmer, describes herself as a lukewarm Democrat who voted for <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in 1980 but switched to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1984 and plans to vote this time for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. If Mrs. <PERSON> Tremaine </PERSON> is a Reagan Democrat, the phenomenon she represents goes back further than <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The last Democratic presidential candidate to carry <LOCATION> Macomb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> was <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> in 1968. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> won the county and state by comfortable margins in 1972 and <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> did the same in 1976. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is n't writing off <LOCATION> Macomb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> partly because otherwise, it's a staunch Democratic stronghold. Two of its three <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members, 11 of its 12 state legislators and 24 of its 25 county commissioners are Democrats. `` They were conservative Democrats long before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> came along,'' said <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> state legislator from <LOCATION> Utica </LOCATION>. `` They just did n't like the presidential candidates that the national party put forth.'' Anti-tax sentiment is strong in <LOCATION> Macomb </LOCATION>. In the early 1980s, voters recalled a state legislator who voted to raise <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s income tax Abortion is a touchy issue among its Roman Catholics, as are U.S.-Soviet relationships among its Eastern European ethnic groups and crime among auto workers who led the white flight from <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> to the suburbs after the city's 1967 race riots. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' task is to persuade <PERSON> Macomb </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Democrats that he is less liberal than past Democratic presidential nominees <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, and that the gains <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> boasts have been illusory for them. The unemployment rate in <LOCATION> Macomb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> is running about 6.8 percent, somewhat higher than the national rate of 5.6 percent in August. Recent local polls indicate that only one in five Macomb Democrats who voted for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1984 might vote for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in November. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made a highly publicized visit Sept. 13 to a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> factory in <LOCATION> Sterling </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, where he rode in an M-1 tank to underscore a speech stressing his commitment to a strong <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaigned here in August and September, and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> campaigned for his vice president earlier this month in <LOCATION> Sterling </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, not far from the tank facility. Both <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> have played to <LOCATION> Macomb </LOCATION>'s conservative Democrats by portraying themselves as defenders of family values and tough on crime, drugs and communism. `` It's a patriotic area,'' <PERSON> Gilsenan </PERSON> said. `` People were flying the flag before it became popular again.'' The first wave of newcomers to <LOCATION> Macomb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> after World War II were mainly Catholics from <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> who brought along their Democratic loyalties that were nurtured by President <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> and the trade unions. `` The people who moved up into <LOCATION> Macomb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in the 50s and 60s came of age in the 30s and 40s and saved up enough to buy a home in the suburbs,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utica </LOCATION>, the county's only Republican in the state Legislature `` But that was a different generation.'' Those older Democrats `` have retired to cottages up <PERSON> North </PERSON>, to mobile homes in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> or died off,'' said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON>, who is running against liberal Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, D-Mich., this year `` Those people are being supplanted by younger people ... concerned they'll be able to pursue the same middle-class lifestyle as their parents. <PERSON> Neel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' centrist message could finally end local Democrats' eight-year infatuation with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. In 1980, he said, `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> hit it at the right time at the right place. If he'd run against a <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, he would have got his clock cleaned.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was at a pig farm, sitting on a bale of hay and talking about rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> while Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Durbin </PERSON> stood a few feet away saying the presidential candidate was going about things all wrong. With the election nearing, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign message was `` completely overshadowed'' by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s sharply critical television commercials, <PERSON> Durbin </PERSON> said. His advice to his party's candidate was that the uphill race could still be won, but <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> needed above all to `` come out and be hard-hitting and forceful. Now, <PERSON> Durbin </PERSON> and other Democrats with the same message have gotten their wish. Over the next few days, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> refined his new Populist campaign rhetoric to its essentials, waved <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> brochures in the autumn air with a denunciation that they were `` political garbage'' and charged in a new television commercial that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s own ads were `` full of lies, and he knows it.'' In a television message Saturday night, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was accusing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of a campaign `` of fear and of smear'' and he was vowing to `` fight my heart out for the things I believe in.'' The polls say <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is on the verge of sweeping into the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in next month's election. But like trailing candidates everywhere, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is making a final determined effort to salvage his candidacy. `` This is 18 months and 450,000 miles. He's not giving up now,'' said <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Metropoulos </PERSON>, the man who travels everywhere with the governor. Yet even as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> readied his charge, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate was scoffing at the man from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is no <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, referring to the political patron saint of the underdog. The sharpened rhetoric and new commercials were not the only evidence of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' last campaign stand. He also stepped up the pace of campaigning at the same time <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was cutting back on his. And <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> seemed to accepting every TV interview offer that came his way. Yet from <PERSON> Durbin </PERSON>'s vantage point in rural <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> to other party officials around the country, Democrats say <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> needs excitement as much as issues. Thus <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> twice last week leapt to his feet during rallies and pumped his fists in the air like a cheerleader, trying to ignite the crowd and the candidate. Democrats do not minimize the difficulties. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s lead in the national public opinion polls ranges from seven points to 17, although <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' own polls show it below 10. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appears to have an overwhelming advantage in the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, as well, with a seemingly solid foundation of Southern and Rocky Mountain states. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' operatives have had well-publicized squabbles with Democratic regulars from coast to coast. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' performance in the second presidential debate on Oct. 13 left some of his aides demoralized. Adviser <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Brazile </PERSON> resigned last week after making personal remarks about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that brought an apology from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. And for weeks, <PERSON> Durbin </PERSON> told reporters, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` had his character assailed and in some quarters destroyed by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> negative advertising.'' Said <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, `` I would n't have been a punching bag on some of those issues. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides also have insisted for weeks that if they could break through <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s persuasive campaign attacks the voters would swing behind their man on the strength of his promise to stand up for jobs, tougher trade competition, health care and education. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does n't want this campaign to be about his record and that's why he's put up a campaign of labels and fog and deceptions,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON>. The new <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> commercials are designed to counter advertisements the vice president has used. One <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ad shows a revolving door with prisoners moving through, and talks of the former <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> furlough program and a prisoner who failed to return from a weekend pass and later brutalized a man and his wife. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' TV reply says that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` wo n't talk about all the thousands of drug kingpins furloughed from federal prisons while he led the war on drugs,'' including one who raped and murdered a pregnant woman of two. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has taken a furlough from the truth,'' the ad says. The second one is meant to counter a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ad that shows <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in a tank and contends the governor opposes several weapons. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> counter-ad shows <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> watching the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> commercial, then clicking the television off and saying he favors the weapons. `` I'm fed up with it. Have n't seen anything like it in 25 years of public life, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s negative TV ads, distorting my record, full of lies, and he knows it,'' he says. That commercial is similar to a script <PERSON> Durbin </PERSON> handed a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide last week, although the congressman disclaims any credit for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' aggressive new style. One <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide said the governor began fighting back a few weeks ago, after Republicans started using campaigning by <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, who along with his fiance was attacked by <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, the now nationally known escapee from a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> furlough program. The ads were the most dramatic element of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' stretch drive this week, but not the only one. He spent one day condemning <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> campaign brochures, including one that said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had the support of murderers, rapists and drug dealers. The next day, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> compared <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign to Watergate and said `` truth was the first casualty'' in both. All the while, he honed his rhetoric. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to help the people who already have it made. I want to make every American a full shareholder in the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream,'' he said. A few hours later, the line was refined: `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to help the people who already have it made. I want to help every American family make it.'' A few days later, criticizing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s tax cut as favoring the wealthy, he said simply, `` He's on their side. I'm on yours.''

<HEAD>Charge Of Alcohol Use At Atomic Plant Shows Need For NRC Rule,
Lawmaker Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new allegation of alcohol abuse at a nuclear power plant illustrates the need for strict federal regulations to detect substance abuse at atomic reactors, says the chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> investigations subcommittee. `` It is the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s -RRB- responsibility to protect against drug and alcohol abuse,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> and Insular Affairs subcommittee on investigations and oversight `` It is not enough for the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> to leave it to the industry to regulate itself.'' <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON>, who has held a series of hearings on the question of substance abuse at nuclear plants, wants the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> to issue stiff regulations on drug and alcohol abuse instead of leaving regulations up to individual utilities. The commission proposed a new rule last month that would require reactor owners to conduct random drug tests, test employees for drugs based on cause, report drug use to the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> and mandate personnel sanctions. But the rule would leave alcohol detection and enforcement up to `` the prudent judgment of each utility.'' Commission officials say no final decision has been made on the proposed regulation. In latest allegation of substance abuse at an atomic reactor, <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON> provided The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> with an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> document outlining an accusation made by an employee at the <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> Power Station in <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, against a senior plant manager. The employee, according to the report, told a superior that the manager had alcohol on his breath and stumbled as he passed through a radiation-detecting device on the night of Oct. 10. But officials at <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, operator of the reactor, said the company hired a private investigator the next day who concluded several days later that there was no evidence of alcohol abuse. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, assistant vice president at the plant, defended the utility's internal substance abuse program. In a telephone interview Friday, <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said the employee, who was charged with checking for fires at the reactor, reported his accusation to a superior. The shift supervisor talked to the senior manager `` at length'' and decided there was no evidence of alcohol. <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said under the company's internal regulations, the manager could have been ordered to take a blood test if the supervisor found cause. He said such blood tests have been ordered in the past. The subsequent investigation turned up no evidence to corroborate the alcohol charge, he said. But <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON>, who wrote a letter to <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lando </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> last week urging a strict rule on both alcohol and drugs, and a top <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON> aide said it is wrong to rely on self-policing and criticized the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> for not conducting its own investigation. `` At the very least you want the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> to do is find out what happened,'' said subcommittee investigator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheibel </PERSON>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> ca n't take the trouble to send somebody out there? `` The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> is in a position of public trust, and at the very least the public can expect the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> to act cautiously and not just accept the word of the person who said, ` No, there was no problem','' he said. Commission spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> was `` looking into'' the allegation, but said he did not know to what extent. <PERSON> Scheibel </PERSON> said he was told by <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> officials the agency is not conducting a separate investigation. <PERSON> Scheibel </PERSON> noted that the senior manager in question was a higher ranking official at the company than the shift supervisor who would have had to order the blood test. He said that could be an `` inhibiting factor.'' But plant officials said a thorough _ and independent _ investigation was conducted and that no other employees corroborated the alcohol allegation. The <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> report comes on the heels of a subcommittee hearing earlier this month that focused on an allegation of alcohol abuse against a plant manager at the <ORGANIZATION> Davis-Besse </ORGANIZATION> reactor near <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Icelandic Residents Vote On Ruff-erendum On Dog Ownership</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By AGUST ASGEIRSSON</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>REYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Residents of <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION> are getting one last chance to stop the capital from going to the dogs. This week, they vote on an experimental program relaxing a ban on dogs in the city of 88,000. The weeklong referendum begins Monday and asks voters to say whether the 4-year-old program has been a success. City Hall banished dogs in 1924 following an outbreak of dog-related disease. For 60 years it resisted attempts to overturn the ban, despite ridicule from abroad and lurid stories about mass slaughter of illicit dogs. In 1978, dog owners went to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in an unsuccessful bid to have the ban declared unconstitutional. The issue made headlines again when <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gudmundsson </PERSON>, then the finance minister, threatened to emigrate unless he could keep his dog in <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>. Compromise finally came in 1984 when City Hall, while keeping the ban on the books, set up some exemptions and promised a referendum after four years on how <PERSON> Reykavik </PERSON> and man's best friend were getting along. `` We are of the opinion that the vote is not necessary because of the good experience we've had in allowing conditional dog-ownership,'' Mayor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Oddsson </PERSON>, who owns a German shepherd named <PERSON> Tanni </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> -RRB-, recently told <ORGANIZATION> Morgunbladid </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>'s main newspaper. But nevertheless, the promised ballot box is being set up in the city sports hall, and citizens will vote yes or no on the question: `` Do you think that the experimental dog rules have been successful?'' <PERSON> Oddsson </PERSON> said the vote is not binding but if there is an overwhelming majority either way, then `` we must take notice of that.'' With opinion polls showing 2-1 support for the exemptions, dog owners are confident. But one city official, <PERSON> Magnus </PERSON> <PERSON> Oskarsson </PERSON>, said voters are so apathetic on the issue they may ignore the referendum and give anti-dog forces a victory by default. Strict rules apply to <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>'s 850 registered dog owners. Annual licenses cost $ 120, dogs must undergo an annual medical checkup, and owners must have insurance. The city center is permanently out of bounds, and dogs must stay out of public parks between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m. They can not enter public buildings, restaurants, children's playgrounds, barbershops, prisons, cemeteries, morgues and buses. Leashes are always required. According to city veterinarian <PERSON> Oddur </PERSON> <PERSON> Runar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hjartarson </PERSON>, the ban was imposed after dogs began transferring a dangerous sheep disease to human beings. Hyatid disease, which once infected an estimated 20 percent of <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>'s population, is caused by a worm that can cause blindness in people and even death, <PERSON> Hjartarson </PERSON> said. Dogs picked up the disease from eating the intestines of slaughtered sheep. The disease has since been eradicated and illegal dog ownership has become rampant _ along with the lurid stories. `` There were all these stories in the foreign press about dogs being caught and killed. It never happened. I recall perhaps one example of a dog being impounded,'' <PERSON> Oskarsson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gudrun </PERSON> <PERSON> Gudjohnsen </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Dog-Breeding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, warns a new ban `` would be a big step backward'' and not likely to be enforced. `` During the 60 years of the old ban, there were hundreds of dogs in the capital. People ... ought to realize that it is far better to have an effective monitoring and control system than going back to a system of no control,'' she said.

<HEAD>An Agreement at Last, But Round Two May Be a Killer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The difficulty of reaching a short-term agreement under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> keeps its military bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> raises what was once an unthinkable notion _ an eventual <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> pullout from <ORGANIZATION> Subic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Air </PERSON> <PERSON> Base </PERSON>. The agreement signed last week after six months of sometimes-bitter negotiations covers only the use of the bases until 1991, providing for $ 962 million in economic and military aid for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> over the next two years. It is a sharp increase, but many Filipino politicians say it's far from enough. If the Americans are to remain beyond Sept. 30, 1991, the negotiators probably will face difficulties which were only hinted at in this year's talks, according to analysts. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> scholar, said until the talks brought to the fore the spectre of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pullout from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, `` it was sort of an unthinkable, unmentionable issue.'' As the talks were going on, both Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could move its bases if the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> demanded too much. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who is with the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION>, an independently funded think tank, predicted that if nationalist forces continue to shape the debate in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> over the bases, negotiators for both sides will consider a phaseout of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. The debate in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> also will be affected by how well the current agreement is implemented. The funds promised in the agreement, while falling short of the annual $ 1.2 billion sought by the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, are still substantially higher than the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid appropriated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in previous years for use of the bases. And in light of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> budget crunch, the difference is significant. Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> minority in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, raised a warning flag: `` Just how that money is going to be found in a foreign operations budget already carved to the bone to meet other base rights and peace-keeping commitments is not readily apparent to this senator.'' But an influential legislative aide who spoke only on condition of anonymity said that there is enough bipartisan support for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> so that `` there are ways the money could be found.'' He conceded this would mean short-changing other aid recipients or wrangling with the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for some of its money. `` It wo n't be easy,'' he said. Another struggle is expected over a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contribution to a $ 5 billion multinational aid program to help ease the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>' $ 28 billion debt. Although the package is unrelated, resolution of the base pact was expected to boost support in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for the international initiative. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is spearheading the effort, although <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will foot most of the bill. The international aid package, if it is approved and funded, `` will grant legitimacy'' to the U.S.-Philippine bases agreement in the eyes of the Filipino public and leadership, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bresnan </PERSON>, a senior research associate at the <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. So far, President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> is facing a hard time selling the new agreement to intellectuals and <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s urban middle class, who accuse her government of selling out their country's sovereignty But some analysts said that if Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> wants the Americans to stay, she must bring the debate before the broad public and take a position herself. `` She has to take a stand and begin to shape opinion,'' said <PERSON> Bresnan </PERSON>. Retired Gen. <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, former national security adviser who headed a study of the bases issue for the Council on Foreign Relations in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said, `` What we have to hope for is that the Filipino people weigh in on this, because there is overwhelming support among them for the bases.'' The Filipinos who oppose the continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence `` feel that as long as we're there, they ca n't cut the umbilical cord with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, `` and nothing we can do will change that.''

<TEXT>
 In dealing a blow to an ambitious Serbian politician, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders have shown how difficult it is to quell ethnic turmoil or introduce democracy in this one-party state. With millions watching on television, the Communist elite last week ended 38 hours of bitter debate with a dramatic rebuff to <ORGANIZATION> Serbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> party leader <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>. A close ally of <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dusan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ckrebic </PERSON>, was the only member of the ruling Politburo not to win a secret vote of confidence Wednesday from the party's policy-setting <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Ckrebic, an old-time Communist in his 60s, immediately offered his resignation. But <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> angrily intervened to stop consideration of the offer, and <PERSON> Ckrebic </PERSON> remains on the Politburo for now. Another Ckrebic ally charged that an `` unprincipled coalition'' tried to bring <PERSON> Ckrebic </PERSON> down to hurt <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>. The meeting, which did little to tackle the growing economic crisis, gave <PERSON> Yugoslavs </PERSON> a revealing look at their squabbling leadership. Serbs who have rallied round <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>'s campaign for greater Serbian control over the provinces of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> were furious that only a Serb _ Ckrebic _ fell victim to the unprecedented vote of confidence for Politburo members. `` Did you see what they did to us?'' fumed a <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> television journalist. The next day, 20,000 Serbs in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> protested the outcome. Chanting `` We will not give up Ckrebic!'' they literally turned their backs on two Politburo members who came to address complaints that the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> session did nothing to meet their demands. The 200,000 <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Serbs </LOCATION> and Montenegrins, a minority in what was once a <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> heartland, want to end alleged harassment by the ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> majority. They also want to oust some ethnic Albanian Communist leaders. The call for action extends far beyond <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. With inflation at 217 percent and living standards halved since 1980, most of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s 23 million people are fed up with leaders they perceive as ineffectual and corrupt. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s response to the widespread demand for new leaders was the vote of confidence and the prospect that a third of the committee's 165 members would be replaced in the next six weeks. That would constitute the single biggest sweep of top party ranks since Stalinists were purged after <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s break with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1948. But it fell short of widespread expectations of an immediate shake-up, and the choice of who should fall is likely to get mired in the usual battle among the party leaderships of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s six republics and two provinces. The broad powers given those eight leaderships under the 1974 constitution have enabled widely varying political cultures to develop. The most obvious gap is between the rich, Western-oriented north and the bankrupt, backward southern areas of <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Macedonia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. Another rift has opened up between liberal northern <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> and the demagogic populism of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>. Party chief <PERSON> Stipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON>, from the republic of <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION> between <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, hailed the vote of confidence in Politburo members as a step to party democracy. But the way <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> tried to undo the verdict showed clearly that however much he supports economic and even political reform, he will protect <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s and his own interests first. The leaders agree that change is needed, <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> said after the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting. But he said the party's only experience in cleaning its own house is in purges ordered from the top. `` We are still learning the rules of the game,'' he said. The half-hearted steps toward political reform show how hard it is for any one-party system to change without the Communists either relinquishing power to some form of popular control or simply carrying out a ruthless purge. <PERSON> Stane </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolanc </PERSON>, a former No. 2 to the late <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>, said during the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s debate that the crisis probably cost <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> `` a billion dollars'' in lost foreign investments. <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> tried to assuage what he said were foreign fears that <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is descending into chaos. `` <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> will not fall apart,'' he said. `` There is a great deal of quarreling in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, but it is not as dangerous as it may appear at first glance.'' But Western creditors are likely to remain uneasy about recovering any of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s $ 21 billion foreign debt. Economic and constitutional reforms designed to attract foreign and private investment are lumbering their way through party and government organs this fall. For years, <LOCATION> Yugoslavs </LOCATION> have called for such reforms _ and more radical ones, such as a return to private farming in this largely agricultural nation. Ironically, the political struggle fueled by the ambitions of <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> may deter foreign investors just as <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> opens up to capitalist investment.

 The 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which adjourned with a parting salvo in the war against drugs, may best be remembered for its wrestling over two national controversies _ the Iran-Contra affair and the nomination of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Both dramas, played out in ornate committee rooms before national television audiences, involved the lawmakers in bitter feuding among themselves and with the White House. A host of other issues produced a lengthy list of accomplishments over a two-year session that brought to a close the first 200 years of congressional history. For the first time since 1976, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, working furiously, passed all 13 appropriations bills before the start of fiscal 1989 _ an event accomplished at three minutes to midnight on Sept. 30, the end of fiscal 1988. `` I think it's been one of the truly great Congresses in my experience and in this century,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash. `` It's turned out to be not only a historic <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but also an extraordinarily productive one. Other major legislative accomplishments included: _ A multibillion dollar attack in the `` war against drugs'' that features money for rehabilitation, up to $ 10,000 in civil penalties and loss of federal benefits for personal use of even small amounts of drugs, and a death penalty for drug dealers who murder during drug-related crimes _ A complex tax package whose main purpose was correcting errors in the 1986 tax overhaul, but also included dozens of tax benefits to one group or another as well as the tax increases to pay for them It has a three-year price tag of $ 4.1 billion. _ The first complete overhaul of the federal welfare system since its inception during the depression of the 1930s _ Ratification of the first U.S.-Soviet arms reduction treaty The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces, or INF, treaty requires elimination within three years of all missiles with a range of 300 miles to 3,400 miles. _ A sweeping revision of the trade laws, to reduce the trade surpluses that other countries run with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ The $ 18 billion Clean Water Act, passed after two vetoes by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and designed to improve the quality of many of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s waterways _ Catastrophic health insurance for millions of elderly or disabled people who receive <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>, providing free hospital care for lengthy illnesses after the recipient pays the first $ 564 _ Two civil rights bills, the Civil Rights Restoration Act and the Fair Housing Act _ An $ 800 million health package designed to fight the AIDS epidemic, including money for testing, research and home care _ A $ 1.2 billion bill providing individual payments of $ 20,000 to Japanese-American survivors of World War II internment camps established in Western states after the Japanese attack on <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> _ Drought relief for crop and livestock producers hit by the summer drought, with a price tag estimated from $ 3.9 billion to $ 5.1 billion _ A package of veterans legislation, including a bill to elevate the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to Cabinet status, an action that will give the new Department Veterans Affairs additional political clout _ An $ 88 billion highway and mass transit bill that permitted states to boost the speed limit on some interstate highways to 65 miles per hour _ Legislation prohibiting smoking on domestic airline flights of two hours or less, a period that covers the vast majority of commercial flights Both <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, called the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the most productive in two `` I believe it is the most productive one since <ORGANIZATION> LBJ </ORGANIZATION>, 20 years ago,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said, referring to the leadership of <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Baines </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and passage of the 1965 Civil Rights Act. `` Perhaps the most productive since 1965-1966,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> echoed. Senate Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> was perhaps thinking of the session's occasionally raucous, partisan, fighting moments as well as its accomplishments, when he said he could sum everything up with two words: `` historic and hysteric.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who assumed the speaker's chair at the start of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, replacing <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> `` Tip'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, ended the session the subject of an ethics investigation into whether he abused his office for personal financial gain. A separate ethic probe was under way into whether he violated House rules by disclosing a purported <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> covert operation in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' prompt action on money matters, partly as a result of the October 1987 stock market crash, meant the government started fiscal 1989 this month without the usual threats of a government-wide shutdown. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was relieved not to get another catchall spending bill, wrapping together money for hundreds of government programs. Following the market crash, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> officials and congressional leaders held a series of closed-door meetings for a month, seeking to end a year of clashes over spending and tax levels. Their budget summit of last November produced an agreement _ since adhered to _ that limited tax increases and set caps on spending levels for domestic, military and foreign assistance programs for the last two federal fiscal years. One of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' earliest acts was to undertake a massive investigation of the Iran-Contra affair. For 14 weeks during the spring and summer of 1987 virtually all other business was shunted into the background while <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committees held unprecedented joint hearings. Television carried the proceedings to the nation as Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and his former colleagues wove a tale of a clandestine enterprise extending to four continents. Parallels to Watergate were drawn and suspense built over whether evidence ultimately would link the entire affair directly to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The committees reviewed more than 300,000 documents and interviewed more than 500 witnesses as they probed the sale of weapons to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the diversion of some of the `` profits'' to aid the Contra rebels fighting <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who had opposed the arms-for-hostages swap, summed it up for investigators: `` Our guys got taken to the cleaners.'' But in the end, there was no `` smoking gun.'' In a report issued at the end of 1987, the committees concluded that a `` cabal of ... zealots'' had lied, deceived <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and each other and exhibited disdain for the law. `` The ultimate responsibility for the events in the Iran-Contra affair must rest with the president,'' they concluded. Of 110 judicial court nominees submitted by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, 91 were confirmed. As a result, in nearly eight years in office, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has named just more than half of the active judges on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> district and appellate courts and the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. By far the most contentious nomination fight was over <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s nomination of <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> to succeed <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> The conservative nominee had written much that was controversial, and he refused to back down from his criticism of what he saw as the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s unconstitutional activism It was a fight basically fought out on television, from the live broadcasts of the confirmation hearings and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sessions, to the taped commercials from both sides. Even though clearly defeated, <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> declined to withdraw, insisting on a vote. When it came, he was rejected 58-42. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s second attempt to replace <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> was torpedoed when <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> withdrew as a nominee after conflict of interest questions arose he after he admitted smoking marijuana while a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> professor <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s third choice, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, was confirmed 97-0 last Feb. 3.

 The most important social lawmaking done by the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was the welfare overhaul bill. A painstaking compromise, the new law requires states to create job, training and education programs and requires welfare mothers of children over 3 to participate in them. States are also told to crack down on child support collection and establish paternity in many more births involving welfare recipients. The welfare changes are to be phased in over five years at a cost of $ 3.3 billion. Proponents caution that the act is not a panacea for poverty, but their aim is scarcely less modest. They hope to see the welfare system transformed from a check-mailing operation into an avenue to independence and parental responsibility. While the welfare bill demonstrated cooperation between the two, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> took on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration over civil rights. Over <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> enacted the Civil Rights Restoration Act to broaden the protections afforded to women, minorities, the elderly and the disabled under four federal civil rights laws. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in 1984 that only specific programs or activities receiving federal monies had to comply with the four anti-bias statutes. Under the new law, entire institutions, government agencies and some corporations must comply even if only one activity receives federal funds. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also strengthened the nation's fair housing law by allowing stiff fines against those found guilty of discrimination. Previous law only gave the federal government a mediation role. In the field of foreign affairs, the long-running dispute over aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels was the most divisive issue. The rebels benefited from $ 100 million in aid, including weaponry, that had been approved by the previous <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. But it was to prove the last military assistance <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would give. On Feb. 3, 1988, with Speaker <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> taking a high-profile role and urging colleagues to `` give peace a chance,'' the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> defeated by eight votes an administration plea to give the rebels new lethal aid. Follow-up legislation was approved to give solely `` humanitarian'' aid _ food, clothing and medicine _ to the Contras. But by year's end even their supporters conceded the rebels had ceased to be a fighting force.

<HEAD>Artist's Popularity Is Stronger Than Ever 10 Years After His Death</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A decade after the death of artist <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON>, the little white house that holds his beloved illustrations groans from the weight of 1.3 million visitors. And his Saturday Evening Post covers that art critics scoffed at are fetching prices as high as $ 500,000 from such collectors as <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> billionaire <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Perot </PERSON>. The tall, thin, pigeon-toed artist, who called himself a hack and feared losing his audience all his life, would be amazed and amused at his enormous popularity, said his son <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON>. `` He liked being recognized on the street, but he was always a little surprised by it,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> Poughkeepsie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, home. <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON>'s growing popularity threatens to overwhelm the pretty town of 2,300 people where he lived for 25 years before his death on Nov. 8, 1978, at the age of 84. Nearly 130,000 people will visit the <LOCATION> Rockwell </LOCATION> museum this year, said director <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> <PERSON> Moffatt </PERSON>. She said the museum, which opened in 1968 in the 18th century Georgian house, has stopped advertising because it is filled to capacity six months of the year. `` He would have said ` Gee whiz!' _ that was his favorite expression _ ` I ca n't imagine why they would want to spend all that time looking at my pictures.' But he would be sorry about all the traffic in town,'' said <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Batty </PERSON>, assistant museum director and a friend of <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION>'s. `` I go home every Friday night and leave the town to the tourists for the weekend,'' said insurance agent <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvadore </PERSON>. Townspeople said they will breathe a sigh of relief when a new museum finally opens far from the center of town. Ground breaking is set for late 1989. All the excitement is for a humble painter who told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in an interview shortly before his death: `` I just do the things that people pay me very high prices to do.'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> art dealer <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Goffman </PERSON> believes <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> is the best-known artist in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` He was on 3 million coffee tables with The Saturday Evening Post,'' she said. She set an auction record for a <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> painting in 1981 with her bid of $ 253,000 for `` The Homecoming Marine.'' She sold it to <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> a few years later at double the price and believes <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION>'s finest works now can fetch $ 1 million <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Percevel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> began his magazine-cover career at 16 after dropping out of art school in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He was 22 when he did the first of 321 Saturday Evening Post covers that would make his a household name. His `` Four Freedoms,'' paintings that traveled the country in 1943, raised more than $ 130 million for the war effort. The year before his death he was awarded the nation's highest peacetime award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Up to his final year, however, <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> worked almost obsessively. `` He felt even up to the end that his popularity might all vanish,'' his son said. <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> said shortly before his death: `` I want to be working on a picture and just fall over dead. ... I do n't want to sit in a chair or go to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> or anything like that.'' He did not get his wish. Ill health made it impossible for him to work the last year of his life. <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> never was much of a businessman, his son said, and so he often gave up the rights to his work and gave away his paintings. When he died, `` he was n't really a wealthy man,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>, a sculptor who lives in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, is casting a bronze sculpture of frolicking children for the new <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> museum, and eldest brother <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON>, an artist who lives in <LOCATION> Stockbridge </LOCATION>, has shown some of his father's whimsical spirit with temporary sculptures he has made out of plastic toys. Having <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> for a father `` had its advantages and its disadvantages,'' said <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON>, 57. `` All I can say about it is that I miss him.''

 A barbecued buffalo sandwich once bitten into by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> is being preserved for posterity by an Illinois family. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenne </PERSON>, now 42, was a Boy Scout in his native <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> when <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, then vice president, sank his teeth into the sandwich. <PERSON> Jenne </PERSON> walked off with the uneaten portion and his family has kept it in a deep freeze since. `` It'll probably stay frozen forever,'' <PERSON> Jenne </PERSON> said recently. `` It's been a part of the family for 28 years.'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, then a presidential hopeful, was guest at a local Republican barbecue in <LOCATION> Sullivan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jenne </PERSON>, 14, and his Scout troop were detailed to surround <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s table to keep the throngs away. `` Security was n't like it is today,'' <PERSON> Jenne </PERSON> recalled. `` It was pretty lax.'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> had taken just three or four bites when he had to leave. `` I saw -LRB- the sandwich -RRB- sitting there, so I just grabbed it, plate and all,'' <PERSON> Jenne </PERSON> recalled. That partially eaten sandwich became <PERSON> Jenne </PERSON>'s claim to fame. The incident got newspaper coverage at the time and again, eight years later, when <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> was elected president. The sandwich, <PERSON> Jenne </PERSON> said, has been stored in a glass jar over the years. The paper plate on which it rested, still sporting barbecue stains, is between the pages of a folder which his mother, <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON>, created especially for `` sandwich souvenirs.'' Printed on the plate, in a 14-year-old's handwriting, are the words `` This is the plate on which Vice President and future President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> ate buffalo barbecue. Sept. 22, 1960.'' The sandwich has survived weather-related power outages and once falling on the floor. `` I think -LRB- the sandwich -RRB- has survived better than <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> has,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Jenne </PERSON> said.

 The Lebanese, with rival Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> groups claiming to govern them, fear the monthlong turmoil over a new president will formally sever ties that kept the nation together through a 13-year civil war. `` We have no president and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> is lost. What is there to help <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> survive?'' said <PERSON> Kazem </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON>, 88, the eldest of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliamentary </ORGANIZATION> deputies and an architect of the country's independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943 `` This is the worst crisis we've ever had,'' said <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON>, appointed interim Parliament speaker last week. `` The political, social and economic systems have ceased to exist. We just do n't know where we're heading. He echoed the despair of most Lebanese at the creeping partition of the country into Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> cantons after <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> failed to elect a president to succeed <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> when his six-year term expired Sept. 23. Parliamentary efforts failed because <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> deputies, opposed to Syrian-backed candidates who were the most serious contenders, boycotted the electoral sessions and blocked a quorum. <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> appointed army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, head of a caretaker military government minutes before he stepped down. But acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem, declared that his Cabinet, installed under <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>, was the legitimate one. Three Moslem army officers named as ministers under <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> quit. All but one Christian in <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>' Cabinet resigned and handed their ministries over to <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. The crisis deepened last week when <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> failed to elect a new speaker to succeed <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, a pro-Syrian Shiite Moslem, after his one-year term expired. <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> was appointed in the session, which once again was boycotted by the Christians. The Americans had sought with the Syrians to produce a compromise candidate for the presidency but have backed off diplomatic efforts until after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential election Nov. 8, one well-informed Lebanese said. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> now appears to be as much at a loss about <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> as the leaders of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> themselves,'' said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Despite widespread fears that the constitutional crisis will touch off new fighting, there have been only sporadic clashes between Christians and Moslems. The two sides, after years of warfare and intervention by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, have achieved a military balance. The estimated 800,000 Christians, led by <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON>, a former medical student who commands their main militia, have been receiving shiploads of weapons and ammunition from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, freed from the gulf war against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> by an Aug. 20 cease-fire, has been arming the Christians to sabotage <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s efforts to pacify <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s archrival in the Arab world, backed <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> during the war and supports <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s estimated 1.7 million Moslems. `` The Christians are armed to the teeth,'' a senior Lebanese army officer said, also speaking on condition of anonymity. `` They can defend themselves against any Moslem or Syrian attack, but ... they ca n't attack or make any territorial gains.'' The stalemate has sent prices of food, gasoline and other basics soaring. A 2.2-pound can of powdered milk cost 4,000 Lebanese pounds Friday against 2,700 pounds Monday. The Lebanese pound, pegged at 8 to the dollar in 1982 and 337 on Sept. 22, was at 540 Friday. So far, the rival governments have not embarked on an economic war. The Christians easily could cut off electricity, fuel and water supplies to Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. They may be refraining because the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, where 70 percent of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 9.3 million ounces in gold reserves are held, is located on the Moslem side.

 An aircraft mechanic faces manslaughter charges and could lose his certification following his arrest for allegedly improperly installing an engine part that caused a fatal plane crash. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said he knew of no other prosecution of a mechanic for a mistake that led to a fatal crash. `` The circumstances in this case are peculiar,'' <LOCATION> Volusia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's Sgt. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said Friday. `` By its very nature an aircraft is a very sophisticated and very dangerous piece of equipment. It's not like a car that if it breaks down, you dump it by the side of the road.'' <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Halter </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, an employee at <LOCATION> Spruce </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, was arrested Thursday by <LOCATION> Volusia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's investigators on charges of manslaughter by culpable negligence, a third-degree felony, <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said. He was released on $ 2,500 bond. <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Halter </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> mechanic's license is under investigation and could be revoked for violations of agency rules. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> blamed the July 24 death of <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Gatlinburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, on an air-oil separator on his single-engine plane that had been worked on by Halter. Improper installation of the separator caused the engine to lose its oil and freeze up, <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> crashed shortly after takeoff. `` We could trace the path of the plane down the runway from the trail of the oil being expelled,'' <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said. `` If the thing had been tested after the installation, it would have been detected.'' <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said the charges did not represent a crackdown or a change of policy by his department. `` This piece of equipment was installed in direct violation of <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> regulations,'' <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said. `` This person is an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> mechanic and should have known _ that adds up to to probable cause for the third-degree manslaughter charge.''

<HEAD>$4.1 Billion Tax Bill Extends Some Benefits, Adds New Ones</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-The 100th Congress, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 One of the first lessons learned by a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is that there's no better way to keep voters happy than to cut their taxes. There's no money left in the federal treasury to grant any more across-the-board tax reductions such as were approved in 1981. But that does n't prevent the lawmakers from granting targeted relief to one group after another. That's exactly what they did in the tax bill that cleared its final hurdle in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday. It now goes to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and sponsors predict he will sign it. The bill originally was designed to clear up confusing language and correct errors in the landmark tax overhaul enacted in 1986. But it was amended over and over to extend some expiring benefits, add some new ones for selected groups, and raise taxes to finance the benefits. The measure would have no effect on the federal deficit. Although it would cut taxes by $ 4.1 billion over three years, it would raise others by the same amount. And it is not just tax cuts and increases that were attached to the bill. It includes a `` taxpayer's bill of rights'' to rein in what some lawmakers view as an overly aggressive <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>; for example, the agency would have to give 30 days' notice before seizing bank accounts and other property, and would be prohibited from promoting employees on the basis of how much they collect. Some of the other provisions: _ DIESEL: Wipe out a 1987 requirement that farmers, construction companies and other tax-exempt, off-road users of diesel fuel pay the federal tax of 15.1 cents a gallon and later apply for a refund _ MUTUAL FUNDS: For 1988 and 1989, permit owners of mutual fund shares to deduct certain operating expenses of the fund without regard to a general provision allowing deduction of only miscellaneous expenses that exceed 2 percent of income _ HIGHER EDUCATION: Exempt from taxation interest earned on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> savings bonds that are redeemed to finance a college or vocational education, starting in 1990 _ TUITION AID: Renew for 1988 an expired law allowing a worker to avoid tax on up to $ 5,250 a year of employer-provided education assistance Graduate education would not qualify. _ HOUSING: Extend through 1989 a tax credit for owners of newly constructed low-income rental housing Also, extend through 1989 and modify a tax exemption for bonds issued by state and local governments to help low-income families buy their first home. _ TOBACCO: Impose a tax of 45 cents per pound on pipe tobacco _ WRITERS: Allow free-lance writers, artists and photographers to deduct work-related expenses even before a project produces income _ ` HEIFER TAX': Permit livestock farmers to deduct expenses of producing livestock before the animals begin generating income, thus repealing what has become known as the `` heifer tax.'' _ ATHLETICS: Allow an 80 percent deduction for contributions to college athletic scholarship funds even when such `` gifts'' guarantee a fan the privilege of buying a game ticket _ RESEARCH: Extend through 1989 a credit for increased spending for research and experimentation _ JOB TRAINING: Extend through 1989 a credit under which the government pays the first year of wages for certain newly hired economically disadvantaged workers _ CONTRACTORS: Further restrict the `` completed-contract'' method of accounting that allows defense contractors and most big construction companies to delay taxes on part of their profits until a project is completed This change will raise $ 1.3 billion. _ CORPORATIONS: Accelerate estimated tax payments from corporations that switch from an annualized method of computation, raising $ 869 million _ <LOCATION> ALASKA </LOCATION> CORPORATIONS: Repeal a provision that has allowed <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Native </ORGANIZATION> corporations to sell some of their unused tax credits to other companies; repeal will cost the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> companies $ 1 billion _ LIFE INSURANCE: Remove some of the tax advantages of using single-premium life insurance as an investment Loans from such policies would be taxed as cash withdrawals; the new rules would apply to policies whose cash value builds more quickly than one paid through seven equal annual premiums. The change would cost policyholders $ 345 million. _ MAIL CARRIERS: Allow rural mail carriers to deduct 33.75 cents for each mile a personal car is driven on a mail route; most people are allowed 22.5 cents a mile for business-related mileage _ BUSINESS MEALS: Permit operators of offshore or <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil rigs and of some commercial vessels -LRB- but not luxury liners -RRB- to deduct the full cost of meals provided to employees; most business may deduct only 80 percent _ HOME SALE: Allow a surviving spouse to defer taxation on profits from the sale of a principal home, just as though the spouse had not died Present law denies such a break if a spouse dies after a home is sold and before a new one is built. Also, the provision allowing a person over 55 to avoid tax on up to $ 125,000 of profits from the sale of a principal home in which he or she had lived at least three of the last five years would be available to a person who spends up to four of those five years in a nursing home. _ HOME PHONE: Prohibit any person with a home-based business from deducting any part of the base monthly telephone charge as a business expense _ FARM MACHINERY: Tighten depreciation provisions for single-purpose farm structures, such as poultry houses, and farm machinery _ FARM INCOME: Expand a law allowing farmers to defer for one year income from the drought-forced sale of livestock Also, the measure would ensure that farmers may defer taxes on payments received as a result of drought-caused crop losses. _ BANKS: Renew a tax break for healthy savings and loan associations that take over failing associations, and extend the benefit to banks _ HIGH-SPEED RAIL: Permit use of tax-exempt bonds to finance certain high-speed rail facilities _ BLOOD DONORS: Permit states and blood-collection facilities to require blood donors to list their Social Security numbers so they can be traced if tests determine their blood is carrying the AIDS virus _ AMISH: Exempt from Social Security taxes employees from <LOCATION> Amish </LOCATION> and other sects with religious objections to the program; self-employed Amish already are exempt

<HEAD>Met Forges Final Link In `Ring Cycle' Chain</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Fire and flood consumed the stage of the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in the final scene of <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s `` Goetterdaemmerung,'' but instead of fleeing in panic, the audience leapt to its feet and cheered The triumphant premiere of the new production Friday night meant that the nation's leading opera house had forged the final link in its long-awaited new production of <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s epic `` Ring Cycle.'' The sets and the lighting were among the most spectacular ever seen at the Met and, at least as far as the heroine and the villain were concerned, it seemed as if the company had even brought back the much-lamented bygone Golden Era of Wagnerian singing. Soprano <PERSON> Hildegard </PERSON> <PERSON> Behrens </PERSON>, singing and acting with passion and elegance as the noble <PERSON> Bruennhilde </PERSON>, consolidated her claim as a worthy successor to the great <PERSON> Birgit </PERSON> <PERSON> Nilsson </PERSON>. She and bass <PERSON> Matti </PERSON> <PERSON> Salminen </PERSON> as the baleful <PERSON> Hagen </PERSON> dominated the stage and easily penetrated even the cruelest waves of sound that <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> _ and the Met orchestra _ could provide. Not for 13 seasons had the company performed this last and longest -LRB- nearly six hours including two intermissions -RRB- of the four operas in which <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> intertwined Norse mythology and 19th century German philosophy with sometimes muddled, but generally powerful, results. `` Twilight of the Gods'' as the opera is called in English, turns on <PERSON> Hagen </PERSON>'s determination to get his hands on the magical gold ring that has been the source of all the trouble since his father, <PERSON> Alberich </PERSON>, stole it from the <ORGANIZATION> Rhinemaidens </ORGANIZATION> in the first opera, `` Das Rheingold.'' The plot twists might seem silly were they not redeemed by <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s glorious music, which carries the audience through contrivances like an amnesia-inducing potion and a magical helmet that disguises <PERSON> Siegfried </PERSON> so <PERSON> Bruennhilde </PERSON> ca n't recognize her own husband when he kidnaps her. The sets by <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider-Siemssen </PERSON> have combined naturalism with high-tech effects throughout the earlier operas and reach their artistic peak in Act 3. The first scene, a forest clearing where <PERSON> Hagen </PERSON> murders <PERSON> Siegfried </PERSON>, is strikingly realistic, the tableau resembling a Flemish painting. <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wechsler </PERSON>'s lighting moves subtly from dappled sunlight to encroaching darkness as the hero's doom approaches. But the real stage wizardry is saved for the finale, when <PERSON> Bruennhilde </PERSON>'s suicide in <PERSON> Siegfried </PERSON>'s funeral pyre literally sets the world ablaze, causes the Rhine to overflow, and even burns up <LOCATION> Valhalla </LOCATION>, the kingdom of the Gods. All this is vividly brought to life as the orchestra, splendidly conducted by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, pours out the final measures of the score. In a performance so strong it's a shame the biggest weakness was the Siegfried of <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>. He seemed ill at ease on stage, his medium-sized voice showed severe strain by Act 2, and he gave only a workmanlike rendition of his wonderful final narrative. Baritone <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Raffell </PERSON> failed to make much impression in the thankless role of <PERSON> Gunther </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hagen </PERSON>'s half-brother. Soprano <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Harries </PERSON> did better as <PERSON> Gunther </PERSON>'s sister, <LOCATION> Gutrune </LOCATION>, but had trouble with her high notes. In the small but vital role of <LOCATION> Waltraute </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bruennhilde </PERSON>'s sister, mezzo <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> _ who was singing in Ring Cycles 20 years ago _ made a dazzling impression and provided a valuable link with a tradition the Met is bidding to revive. `` Goetterdaemmerung'' will be performed several more times this fall. In the spring, the Met will stage three complete Rings _ one of them on successive Saturday afternoons in April for a nationwide radio audience.

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Meat prices rose Saturday and bread prices will rise by 60 percent, the government said, two days after an unpopular austerity program was amended to allow salary raises for some workers. The <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Politika </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ekspres </ORGANIZATION> said the latest price increases `` will drive the remaining shoppers out of meat markets'' and will further depress living standards. Thousands of Yugoslavs in recent weeks have protested rising prices in a growing economic crisis in the communist nation. As of Saturday, prime quality steak cost $ 6.36 a pound in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, up from $ 5.55. Ground meat rose from $ 2.21 to $ 3.39 a pound. The cheapest type of bread, now available for 5 cents a pound, will cost 8 cents when new bread prices take effect Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> Politika </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ekspres </ORGANIZATION> said. Statistics published here say living standards have dropped to the level of the mid-1960s. Inflation is running as high as 217 percent. Meat prices were boosted considerably three weeks ago. Last year, the government had to cancel sharp increases in bread prices after widespread protests. The average monthly income in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is $ 100, and experts say about 80 percent of it goes for food. Faced with increasing strikes and worker protests, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday eased an austerity program of wage cuts and price rises introduced in May. The amendments allow wages increases of 140 percent to 152 percent this year, but only for workers in profitable companies and in hard-pressed social services like health and education. Another <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> Vecernje </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Novosti </ORGANIZATION>, said about half of Yugoslav companies, employing more than 2 million workers, will not be able to increase their wages because they are not making profits.

 Hurricane <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> slammed into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> today with 125 mph winds and blinding rain, killing at least seven people and forcing thousands on the region's <LOCATION> Carribean </LOCATION> coast to flee inland The hurricane's winds later dropped to 70 mph, and it was downgraded to a tropical storm, but forecasters predicted heavy rains from the storm would cause flash floods and mud slides in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. Nicaraguan radio reported three dead and dozens injured on <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Corn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, about 45 miles off the city of <LOCATION> Bluefields </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> authorities said four drowned and seven were missing there. More than 77,000 people were evacuated in the two countries, authorities said. On <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s coast, the storm flattened homes, felled trees and cut communications. About 1,000 people were evacuated in the early morning darkness after flood waters threatened to engulf a neighborhood in <LOCATION> Bluefields </LOCATION>, 180 miles east of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. The group was taken to a municipal building to ride out the storm, the state radio, Voice of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, reported. Precautionary evacuations also began in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> as the storm swept inland, according to a newspaper report. Severe flooding also was reported in coastal Costa Rican towns, officials there said. <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> has never been hit by a hurricane in recorded history, and the last one that hit <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> was in 1911. Earlier this week, the storm left at least 26 people dead and tens of thousands homeless in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. Forecasters with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said the storm, traveling west at 8 mph, weakened as it passed over land. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> struck <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Corn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> late Friday, state radio reported. Heavy winds and rain knocked out power in <LOCATION> Rama </LOCATION>, 60 miles west of <LOCATION> Bluefields </LOCATION>, and strong downpours were reported in central Chontales and southern <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> provinces. Flash flood and mud slide warnings were issued for <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, western <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. Forecasters predicted more than 15 inches of rain would inundate those areas by Sunday. Storm surges of 10 to 15 feet were expected near and just to the north of the hurricane's center. At noon EDT today, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>'s center was near latitude 11.9 north and longitude 84.5 west, or 120 miles east of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. Maximum sustained winds were 70 mph. `` The danger is effective and real. There exists a great danger of loss of life in the city of <LOCATION> Bluefields </LOCATION>,'' Information Minister <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON> said Friday night. Neighborhood civil defense committees in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> stacked sandbags to form levees against flooding. Heavy winds and rain prompted the government to evacuate hospitals in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cabezas </LOCATION>, 120 miles north of <LOCATION> Bluefields </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Boaco </LOCATION>, an inland city 45 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. Under an emergency law declared Thursday, the government ordered private firms to make available stocks of goods necessary to confront the hurricane. <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aragon </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Juigalpa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, 100 miles west of the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> coast, said refugees were streaming into the city ahead of the storm. `` They're carrying everything they can _ chickens, pigs, sacks of beans and other small belongings,'' he said. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> rivers near the Nicaraguan border spilled their banks, as did the <LOCATION> Coto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> side, officials said. Costa Rican officials feared <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> could destroy many of the 20,000 banana plantations along the coast.

 `` One-liners say a lot,'' says <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, contending that voters have been well informed this year even though the presidential campaigns have often aimed merely for catchy television `` sound bites.'' `` There are a lot of subtleties communicated with a sound bite,'' the brief TV clip on the evening news, he said. `` People receive messages.'' Voters, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, can receive a complex message from a simple one-liner, especially when such elements as body language are added in. While <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said television coverage of the campaign, the dominant medium for most Americans, has occasionally lacked substance, he also said `` the information is out there'' for voters to make up their minds. Both of the presidential compaigns spend millions of dollars on television advertising, and they arrange candidate appearances and speeches with an eye toward getting a particular few seconds on the news. But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said that is n't all bad. `` What you have right now is you have to get a story across and the temptation is to say ` OK, we've got a message today we want to get across on our own terms and nobody else's,''' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` That's a pretty good strategy,'' he said. `` You ca n't fault the strategy.'' `` The people, by and large, know a lot about all four of us,'' he said. `` It's more oriented to one-liners, but, you know, one-liners say a lot. `` Let's not minimize the importance of one-liners.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> made his comments Friday night in an interview as his campaign plane returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after he spent a week stumping in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and South. In the interview, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was mildly critical of the coverage of the campaign but generally satisfied that voters had been told what they need in order to make a choice. `` I found out that, at least in my own case, sometimes I've given what I think have been very susbtantative speeches ... There does n't seem to be much interest in covering it,'' he said. `` The question is, have we been well-served? I think we know a lot about <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bsh </PERSON>. I think they really have a very good idea of the four candidates.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he's now more comfortable as a national candidate because `` a national campaign is now something that's more behind me than ahead of me.'' That comfort level is increased because he's now settling into the traditional role of a vice presidential candidate rather than a lightning rod for controversy, he said. That point was underscored, he said, by a telephone call he received from his wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, late in the week. `` She said ` you must really be giving great speeches, having great crowds, doing all the right things, because I have n't heard a thing about you out here,''' he said. `` Welcome to the traditional role of the vice presidential campaign.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said both of the presidential campaigns have dealt with substantative issues. `` There have been a number of speeches, a number of debates, probably too many speeches,'' he said. `` The information is out there. The question is on how this information gets communicated. `` The question then becomes, what is being communicated? Is it the 15-second sound bite? `` I'll be interested to find out what we've learned from this,'' he said. `` I think we've got to rethink it on both sides. `` You have to look at how television is used by both campaigns,'' he said. `` It is very difficult to do in a substantative way, even though there have been substantative speeches. `` I'm sure we'll go back and there'll be new benchmarks, there'll be new standards, maybe some old standards will be thrown away.''

 Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> is attempting to beat an Election Day deadline with his one-man, rush-to-justice defense in a federal perjury trial that will climax one of the country's most bitter congressional elections. If everything goes as expected, the two-term <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressman will deliver his opening argument in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, just one week after his indictment was handed up and just 15 days before the Nov. 8 election. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, a lawyer, is representing himself in the perjury case and hopes a quick acquittal will bring victory at the polls. He has admitted to a mistake in judgment in negotiating an $ 850,000 loan last year with an undercover agent posing as a financier, but denies criminal wrongdoing. Eventually, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> accepted a $ 150,000 check from a middleman, then returned it uncashed. The 10 perjury charges brought against <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> stem from his testimony before a grand jury in February. Among other things, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> testified he could not recall any mention of drug money; tapes of the meetings have the agent saying the loan money was probably drug-related. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> is facing the same challenger he did in 1986 in his bid for a third term in the House. He calls it a race between `` a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> liberal and a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> conservative.'' Voters in the suburbs east of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> will choose between <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a one-time `` Dukes of Hazzard'' TV star who has had to answer repeated questions from <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> about his admitted bout with alcoholism. Though <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> demanded the speedy trial to obtain a verdict before the election, he has stressed his disadvantage in manpower and time to prepare for the trial, saying he will just have to rely on the `` ol' innocent defense.'' In fact, he will have more going for him, said lawyer <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a former policeman and prosecutor who was the Republican nominee for governor in 1986. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has been a critic of <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> but expressed admiration for his tactics in the case. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said he has seen both laymen and lawyers successfully defend themselves. `` Many defendants found that there was an advantage in that the jury was continously being exposed to the defendant himself while he conducts the trial,'' he said. If <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> is a good courtroom performer, he said, he will be able to impress his case on the jurors `` from the time the trial starts, and not just from the time he takes the witness stand.'' But <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fierer </PERSON>, who has handled a string of high-profile criminal cases and represents another defendant in the money-laundering probe, said that while <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> may get the underdog's sympathy from the jury, he is sacrificing some potentially important options in rushing to trial. `` He really has given up investigative time, the time to go out and find witnesses, to get prepared on witnesses, and that sort of thing,'' Fierer said. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, however, noted that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> has had access to transcripts of his meetings with the undercover agent for some time, `` so he's probably, no doubt, well-prepared to go to trial. And I think probably it is a wise thing for him to do.'' And <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said some pre-trial skirmishing over what can be used in court and demands for information are not as crucial to <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> because `` in this case, the facts are fairly simple.'' If the trial starts Monday, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> also gives up time for pre-trial hearings that could have helped his defense, especially on his claims that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>, also a Republican, is promoting his career at <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s expense. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vining </PERSON> ruled that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> may not present those claims to the jury without conducting a pre-trial hearing on whether <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> could be subpoenaed. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> has n't officially told the judge whether he wants the hearing, but he has indicated he will not permit a delay in the trial It will be up to the jury to decide whether <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> can reconcile the tapes of his meetings with the undercover agent with his later grand jury testimony. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> has vowed to show his answers were not deceitful because he simply could not remember everything said in the negotiations. The 38-year-old congressman has had to curtail campaigning, saying the trial has become the campaign's most important factor. His pre-indictment polls, he said, found a dead heat. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' campaign manager, <PERSON> Maren </PERSON> <PERSON> Hesla </PERSON>, disagreed `` Congressman <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> has attempted to make the verdict the election, but that's just not the case,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hesla </PERSON> said. `` We enjoyed an 18-point lead prior to the indictment.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who has acknowledged a conviction for assault on his wife during the days he was battling alcoholism, has been quiet about his opponent's criminal case. Ms. <PERSON> Hesla </PERSON> acknowledged that <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> has lost news media attention because of the focus on <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s case. `` We're doing what we can to be out there meeting the voters right now,'' she said.

 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s weekly radio address delivered Saturday from Camp David, Md.: My fellow Americans, <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> once said, `` You ca n't fool all of the people all of the time.'' Well, this week, our liberal friends have been trying to prove him wrong. They've charged that our record of lowering your taxes, ending runaway inflation, and igniting the longest peacetime economic expansion ever, has been bad for middle class working Americans. Well, it's time to remind them of a few facts. For example, the misery index: the miserly index was an election year gimmick they cooked up for the 1976 campaign by adding the unemployment and inflation rates. It came to 13.4 percent in 1976, and they declared that no one had a right to seek reelection with a misery index that high. Well, four years later, in the 1980 campaign, they did n't mention the misery index, perhaps because it had grown to almost 21 percent And this year, they still are n't mentioning it. Under us, it's dropped to under 10 percent. Our liberal friends have been hopping around the country, charging that real family income is no higher today than it was 20 years ago. Now, in fact, it's 14 percent higher. But why would they bring family income up at all? After all, between 1977 and 1981 _ maybe you can guess why I picked those years _ the typical American family's income, after taking out inflation, fell seven percent. Think of what it would mean to you and your family if somebody were to cut your family's paychecks by that much today. Think of how much less you could buy at the grocery store, the clothes you could n't get for your children, how much less you could put in the plate at your church or synagogue each week. And then, think of this: since 1981, when we came to office, the typical family's income, after taking out inflation, has soared more than 10 percent. One place you can see what this change means to you is in housing. Our liberal friends have been talking a great deal about affordable housing recently. Do n't they remember that in 1980, as housing prices and interest rates skyrocketed together, one of the few times in history that's happened, and real family incomes plummeted, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream of owning a home almost went down for the count. And the top housing official of the previous administration finally threw up his hands in despair and said, `` For many hard-working families, housing is growing beyond their reach,'' Yes, according to real estate industry economists in 1980, the average American family made just over three-fourths of what it needed to buy a home. Today, with interest rates half of what they were and inflation under control, the typical American family makes over 110 percent of what it needs to buy home. Renters are also doing better. When the liberals left office, the national vacancy rates for apartments in the price range of low and medium income families were around five percent, which means it had become hard for low and medium income Americans to find an apartment. Today, these national vacancy rates are around eight percent, and it's the landlords who are having to wait longer to find tenants. Add this all up and you see that we have more, much more, affordable housing today then we had eight years ago. You'd think all these facts would give our liberal opponents pause, but apparently not. When we note that since our expansion began, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has created more than 18 million new jobs, that unemployment is nearly the lowest it's been in 14 years, and that a greater proportion of Americans are at work today than ever before in our history, the liberals blandly respond that what we need are `` good jobs at good wages.'' Perhaps they believe that most Americans have bad jobs. I do n't believe that, and to tell the truth, I find remarks that put down honest occupations _ yes, including short-order chefs _ offensive, and I expect you do too In any event, overall, job for job, the jobs created since our expansion began pay more than the jobs that existed before. The liberals charge that we've given tax breaks to the wealthy, but when we came to office, the wealthy were paying 19.3 percent of the federal individual income tax revenues. Now it's 26 percent. The charges go on and on, but the truth remains the same. No matter how you look at it, the last time they were in office, the liberals clobbered the American middle class and we stopped them. Some are calling this last-ditch opposition campaign an attempt at `` class warfare.'' So, what's new? Our liberal friends have been at war with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s middle class for years. Now they want you to turn the other cheek, but will they just take that as an opportunity to really let you have it. <LOCATION> Mainstream </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is in better shape today than it's ever been. Why would we ever want to put it back in the hands of those who almost turned out its lights? Until next week, thanks for listening and God bless you.

 Here is the text of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> response to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s weekly radio address Saturday, from <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>: In less than three weeks, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people will elect a new president. It may be the most important election of this century. On the surface, this election has been a series of negative TV ads, quicky polls and instant experts. The ads, the polls, and the experts seem to be driving the process. Most Americans are unhappy with what they are seeing on their televisions. We are a big people and we want a wide view of what's at stake in this election Everything important to the American people can not be reduced to a seven-second sound bite. The ads on television are n't going to tell you much of anything. A little music, some flag waving, and then `` poof'' the ad is over. It's time to look beneath the surface and start asking the important questions. We need a president who tends to the nation's business; who has a sense of the future. We need a president who has a plan for making the trade deficit a trade surplus; who is willing to make a real commitment to ending the policy of borrow and debt that has put us into a sea of red ink. We need a president who wants to keep <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> strong and who knows that economic power and military strength go hand in hand. We need a president who believes in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> so much that he is not afraid to tell us we have problems that need fixing. We need a president who ways the same thing in public that he says in private and who wo n't make secret deals with the Ayatollah. Two years ago, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people put the Democrats back in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. We won in 1986 because we told the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people we would make a difference in their lives. Our agenda was clear and exact: check and balance a White House that seemed to have lost its way. We delivered despite two years of confrontation. When the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people asked for a clean water bill, we delivered despite a White House that said no. When American workers wanted a new trade bill and jobs for Americans, we delivered despite a White House that said no. When the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people demanded fairness on plant closing, we delivered despite a White House that said no. When the American people demanded an end to the `` slash and burn'' education policy of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, it was the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that said yes. So who is in the mainstream of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> politics? A look at the record of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will answer that question. This <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has tried to be a `` family'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. We have tackled the problems that people talk about when they sit around the kitchen table. For our senior citizens, we have expanded <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> to include catastrophic health insurance. For two-paycheck families, we fought for parental leave and child care bills, only to run into a White House filibuster. For millions of working men and women, we fought for an increase in the minimum wage despite White House opposition. For our nation's security, we fought against waste and fraud in the Pentagon. As majority leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats, I take pride in the work of the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. We have done our duty. We have addressed your concerns. We have listened to the people. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> once said that `` polls are like sleeping pills designed to lull voters into sleeping on election day.'' Do n't let the polls lull you to sleep. Do n't let the political hucksters pick the next president. Look beneath the surface. Look to the record. Vote for the future. Remember that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is always at its best when we face our problems and never stand still. Thank you and God Bless You.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ridiculed presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign theme of `` good jobs at good wages'' on Saturday, asserting it is a cover for the belief `` that most Americans have bad jobs.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s weekly radio address from Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, followed the pattern of recent weeks in which he has launched an entirely partisan attack against the `` liberals'' in this year's election campaign While <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> contended that the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was the champion of the middle class, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> also claimed that honor in the Democratic response. `` As majority leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats, I take pride in the work of the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. We have done our duty. We have addressed your concerns. We have listened to the people,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said in an address relayed only hours after the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had adjourned for the year. The senator said the Democratic-led <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> fulfilled a specific agenda: `` check and balance a White House that seemed to have lost its way. We delivered despite two years of confrontation.'' In his address, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not mention <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> or the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, by name, but his target was clear. Using his favorite catch-word for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asserted that `` our liberal friends'' in the campaign have no response to the nation's robust economy or its low unemployment rate. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> have repeatedly boasted that `` more than 18 million new jobs'' have been created during the economic expansion. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has countered with the charge that many of the jobs created during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency have been minimum-wage positions, such as those in the fast-food industry. `` The liberals blandly respond that what we need are good jobs at good wages,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` Perhaps they actually believe that most American have bad jobs.'' `` I do n't believe that. And to tell the truth, I find remarks that put down honest occupations _ and that's including short order chefs _ offensive. And I expect you do too,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> added. `` The jobs created since our expansion began pay more than the jobs that existed before,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also tried to counter Democratic charges that his administration has given tax breaks to the wealthy by asserting that the middle class has flourished under his administration. Charging that `` our liberal friends have been at war with the American middle class for years,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> argued that `` mainstream <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is in better shape today than it's ever been. Why would we want to put it back in the hands of those who almost turned out its lights?'' For his part, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> contended that the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has dealt with `` the problems that people talk about when they sit around the kitchen table.'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had expanded <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> to include catastrophic health insurance, fought for parental leave and child care bills, and tried to obtain `` an increase in the minimum wage despite White House opposition.'' `` <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> once said that `` polls are like sleeping pills designed to lull voters into sleeping on election day,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. `` Do n't let the polls lull you to sleep.

<TEXT>
 Here is a chronology of major events in the attempts to free the three trapped whales in <LOCATION> Barrow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>: Oct. 13 _ The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whales were discovered trapped in the ice east of <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barrow </LOCATION>. They apparently became stuck a week before. Biologists were unable to contact an icebreaker to give aid. Oct. 14 _ The whales continued to swim several hundred feet offshore, using two holes in the ice to breathe. Biologists believed time was running out for the grays as nighttime temperatures dropped to 13 degrees below zero, threatening to shrink the whales' breathing space. Efforts failed again to contact an icebreaking ship. Oct. 18 _ A biologist said one whale may have pneumonia, as an <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Skycrane </ORGANIZATION> helicopter went to tow a 185-ton Hovercraft-type icebreaking barge 200 miles northwest to the whales. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> telephoned with his support. Oct. 19 _ <ORGANIZATION> Eskimos </ORGANIZATION> cut new holes in ice, but the barge effort was hampered by shallow water. Biologists said the whales' health appeared to be stabilized, and that they were handling their captivity better than first believed. Oct. 20 _ The barge began its journey but moved only about six miles through sand bars, mud and shallow water. Two <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> brothers-in-law arrive with de-icers to enlarge breathing holes for whales. Oct. 21 _ One of the whales, nicknamed `` Bone,'' disappeared and was presumed dead. Rescuers tried `` Plan B:'' A five-ton concrete `` bullet'' wielded by a helicopter loaned by the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. Easterly wind opened `` leads,'' or open water, through the ice within four miles of the whales. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> offered an icebreaker to help in the rescue. Oct. 22 _ Eskimos using chain saws had led the whales almost a half-mile closer to open water by carving a string of 24 breathing holes in the ice. The Skycrane dropping its `` bullet'' had punched four 15-to-20-foot holes in the ice at 75-yard intervals, but a massive pressure ridge of ice stood in the way.

<HEAD>Bentsen Warns Texas Voters Against Ticket Splitting</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> warned his fellow Texans on Saturday against ticket splitting to support him for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for president in hopes of giving powerful jobs to two men with ties to the state. `` Some Republicans ... are trying to peddle the notion that you can vote twice for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told a union audience in <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION> as he stumped with Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` Have you heard that one?'' It was a rare acknowledgement of the political problem tied to his dual candidacies for vice president and re-election to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` A vote for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a vote for <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, and a vote for <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> sure is n't a vote for <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. A vote for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> makes no sense if you care for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` A vote for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a vote against a strong energy policy that will bring this state back,'' he said. Under <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is allowed to run for both the vice presidency and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. He has said he would resign from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> if he and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> win, but he was staying in that race because resigning would automatically hand the seat to Republican opponent <PERSON> Beau </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON> for six years. A resignation, on the other hand, would force a special election. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> made his comments at a joint rally with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in a packed hall owned by the local pipefitters union, whose members are highly dependant on the oil and gas industry. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is a traditionally Democratic part of the state and the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket needs to win big there to have any chance of carrying the state and its 29 electoral votes on Nov. 8. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s press secretary, said the senator spoke up because some news editorials in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> had suggested that Texans support the Republicans for president and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, instead of his Republican opponent <PERSON> Beau </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON>. Some <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporters, who also like <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, have been making that suggestion to boost ticket splitting. The polls show <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> a handy winner in his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race but the Democrats behind in the presidential race and they do n't want <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> supporters of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to feel satisfied by just supporting him for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. After campaigning together in <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> went their separate ways and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> traveled north to <PERSON> Gilmer </PERSON> for the annual `` Yamboree'' celebrating the year's crop of yams before heading on to <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. On a stage decorated with bushels of yams and some pumpkins, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told a crowd of several hundred people, not to listen to Republican ads claiming that the Democrats wanted to take away their guns and were weak on defense. He took particular umbrage at a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ad featuring former test pilot <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeager </PERSON> saying the Democrats were bad for the defense industry, which is a major employer in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` I decided he set some of those high altitude records and forgot to turn on his oxygen,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. Orange-lettered signs proclaimed `` Yammin' with Dukakis-Bentsen'' as the senator spoke and then rode around town in a convertible waving at the friendly thousands attending the festival. There was some disagreement in the campaign entourage as whether there was any real difference between yams and sweet potatoes, and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was asked what he thought the difference was. `` Well, I do n't know,'' he said. `` But I'm yam proud to be here.''

 A fire destroyed a plastics factory Saturday and injured at least 45 people, 20 of them critically, police said. The fire was caused by an explosion of a gas cyclinder inside the factory, said a police officer who spoke on condition of anonymity. The officer said the factory was operating without a license. `` The plastic factory was located inside a grain depot -LRB- warehouse -RRB-, we did not know it was functioning,'' he said. The factory was in the northwestern part of the city. The official said of the injured, seven were not expected to survive. At least 100 firefighters fought the blaze for three hours and brought it under control.

 In a marathon worthy of Captain <PERSON> Ahab </PERSON>'s pursuit of the Great White Whale, a group of high school students staged a 21-hour reading of `` Moby <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>,'' the classic novel of man against whale. The fund-raising event Thursday through Friday kept 19 students at <ORGANIZATION> Monument </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> immersed in whaling music, a film version of the novel and <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Melville </PERSON>'s book. `` I'm going to bed for a little while because I have a soccer game tomorrow, well today, actually,'' <PERSON> Margo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said early Friday. `` I do n't know if this helps to read the book, but it's more fun. Beginning Thursday afternoon, each student and teacher <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> took turns reading chapters. They finished about noon Friday. <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> said she planned the reading of the novel set partly in nearby locales, `` as a way of getting the students enthusiastic about the book. I like the idea of oral reading and I think it's important that they listen to each other read, too. To set the mood, whaling music was played and a videotape of the film `` Moby <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>'' played 14 times through the night. Money raised by the reading will help the students pay for a whale watching trip or a visit to a whaling museum. Each student sought out sponsors for the marathon, so <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> said she had no idea yet how much money was raised. <PERSON> Great </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> is about a dozen miles from <LOCATION> Arrowhead </LOCATION>, the farm where <PERSON> Melville </PERSON> wrote the novel in the early 1850s.

 Authorities arrested a Lebanese woman who was carrying pictures of three Americans held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and a letter from one of them in a false bottom in her suitcase, police said Saturday. The woman stopped Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> Milan </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Linate </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> was carrying photos of <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alann </PERSON> <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Fortunato </PERSON> <PERSON> Finoli </PERSON>, deputy director of the <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> police anti-terrorist unit. He said the photographs were to be given to an Italian businessman, who was not identified. She also carried a handwritten letter signed by <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>, he said. She was arrested and charged with carrying $ 1,000 in counterfeit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bills and 50 grams of heroin, <PERSON> Finoli </PERSON> said. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman contacted by telephone said officials there had been informed about the incident. `` Yes, we are aware of it. It's in the Italian hands,'' he said. Asked if the Italian businessman had any connection with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, he said: `` We're not saying a thing about it.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity. Police refused to say who was to ultimately receive the pictures and documents, or why. The woman arrived on a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airlines </LOCATION> flight from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and her suitcase was examined thoroughly, like those of many other Lebanese passengers, police said. Police also questioned the businessman, who was waiting for the woman at the airport, but freed him because he committed no crime, according to <LOCATION> Finoli </LOCATION>. It was not clear when the large, black-and-white head shots of the three hostages had been taken, <PERSON> Finoli </PERSON> said, adding that police were examining them. It was also not known when the letter from <PERSON> Steen </PERSON> was written, he said. The letter was addressed to the Italian businessman and simply `` expressed thanks to everyone who was working for his -LRB- <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>'s -RRB- liberation,'' <PERSON> Finoli </PERSON> said. He said the woman, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> identified as <PERSON> Aline </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizkalah </PERSON>, 36, apparently worked as a courier for different people in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. She told police she knew nothing about the photos or documents. The woman said the Italian businessman was to give her money, but he denied it, police said. <PERSON> Finoli </PERSON> refused to elaborate on the Italian's identity, saying only that he was from the northern part of the country and `` well known for other things.'' The other documents in the woman's luggage were written in Italian but were in a kind of code, which police were trying to decipher, <PERSON> Finoli </PERSON> said. They did not mention the hostages, he said. He refused to release any more details. The arrest occurred before Islamic Jihad threatened to hurt the hostages in retaliation for an Israeli air raid on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> Friday. Islamic Jihad, a pro-Iranian fundamentalist faction, is believed to hold <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, while <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>'s abduction has been claimed by the pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, is the longest-held foreign hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985. <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, acting dean of agriculture at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION>, was abducted three months later.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

 Police arrested three teen-agers following a plea for justice from an Israeli immigrant who was slashed and raped with her teen-age daughter after her husband was strangled. `` I have been left with nothing,'' the widow said in an interview published Friday by <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION>, a newspaper in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` Now all I want is for them to find my husband's killers, and to go back to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> immediately.'' Police said Saturday they had arrested <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, 17, <PERSON> Dutval </PERSON> <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON>, 15, and <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, 17, all of the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, and charged them as adults with murder, robbery, burglary and rape. Two other suspects were being sought, police said. `` How, how could God give these people the ability to be such sadists?'' the widow said in the <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> interview. It appeared the suspects killed their former employer in a money dispute, stole the keys to his apartment, then went there and attacked his wife and daughter, according to Capt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahey </PERSON>, a police spokesman. Police declined to elaborate on the dispute. The names of the victims were withheld because sex crimes were involved, said Sgt. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>, a police spokesman. However, he said the 50-year-old man and his family had emigrated here from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> about eight years ago. The body of the man, a limousine driver and former contractor, was found slumped in the seat of his car about 3 a.m. Tuesday in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>. He had been stabbed and strangled. About 2 a.m. Tuesday, a gang of youths wearing Halloween masks entered the man's apartment in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> and attacked his wife and teen-age daughter, police said. The woman told <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> that she and her daughter were taken to separate rooms, handcuffed to beds and raped repeatedly. `` Where is the money? Where is your husband?'' they screamed _ but did not say that her husband had been left for dead. The woman said the attackers also threatened to kill her 3-year-old daughter. `` I bit my lips and I knew that if I shouted, they would kill the baby,'' she said. `` They cut them up and threatened them,'' said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mause </PERSON>, a family friend. `` They were terrified. The daughter is in bad shape. ... She is ruined.'' The attackers also ransacked and robbed the apartment, reportedly taking jewelry and $ 6,000 cash. A 14-year-old son was away at the time of the attack. The man had owned a general contracting business at one point and had employed <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> was arrested about Friday evening at a <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> hospital where his girlfriend was having a baby. The other two arrests were late Friday and early Saturday, police said.

Standing before the familiar Cleaver home, which was trucked in from <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, executive producer <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Levant </PERSON> introduced the cast members as they emerged one by one through the front door. Mindful of tradition, <PERSON> Levant </PERSON> said as he announced the members of the original cast: `` <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Billingsley </PERSON> ... Tony Dow ... <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Osmond </PERSON>.. and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathers </PERSON> as the Beaver. The arrival of the show at <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> was marked by the ceremonial mounting of the Cleavers' house number _ 211. The numbers were hammered in and removed three times for the benefit of TV crews who may have missed it. `` This is the day we've looked forward to for many, many years, the beginning of production at <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>,'' studio president <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> said. Everything except the sidewalk -LRB- painted plywood -RRB- in front of the <PERSON> Cleaver </PERSON> house came from <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> _ even the brown leaves -LRB- real leaves -RRB- that were strewn about to simulate autumn. Once inside, the cast wandered around their home. <PERSON> Mathers </PERSON> looked through curtains to the back yard. `` Gee, here we are in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and we have the same neighbors,'' he said, looking out at a wall mural of homes and yards. Much of the 444-acre movie-television complex is still being built. But `` The New Leave It To Beaver,'' which airs on cable's SuperStation TBS, will produce 19 episodes this season in the 22,000-square-foot sound stage, which means the cast and crew will be in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> until March The original `` Leave It To Beaver'' began in October 1957 on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, then moved to <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> in October 1958, where the sitcom ran until September 1963. Twenty years later, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> aired a TV-movie titled `` Still the Beaver,'' which in turn spawned a series of the same title on the Disney channel in 1984. Disney droped the Cleavers after two seasons, but <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> soon ordered 74 episodes for his cable station, which could keep the series on the air until the early 1990s. Economy was a big factor in the move east. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Houbrick </PERSON>, a spokesman for the show, said last season might have been the show's last if it had to continue production on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, where union wages are considerably higher than in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> The cast has nothing but praise for local hospitality and the Universal facility. The studios in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> were `` musty'' and leaked, <PERSON> Mathers </PERSON> said. `` Every time it rained we had to move from one set to another.'' <PERSON> Levant </PERSON>, however, said he sees few differences between <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and West. `` We've still got to hide the palm trees when we go outside, same as <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.''

The corporate guilty plea, to charges it conspired to defraud the government, could result in a fine up to $ 500,000. The New York-based company's plans were disclosed in a statement which says the case is not related to the recently publicized <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation of defense contractors, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday. `` It's somewhat prototypical of the kind of cases that one can expect,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>. `` You have a lot of the same elements and it shows in a kind of generic way how the game is played.'' <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> was indicted in June 1987, several months before the investigation began of defense contractors' use of consultants to get information for use in bidding for contracts. The indictment said <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> treated an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> employee at <ORGANIZATION> Hanscom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> to golf greens fees, baseball tickets, meals and liquor in exchange for information used to bid on contracts.

 Parliament on Saturday approved a package of constitutional amendments designed to make the economy more market-oriented and ease the worst economic crisis since World War II. The amendments also would give <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> more control over its autonomous provinces of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION>. The crisis has been fueled by hundreds of thousands of Serbs protesting the alleged harassment of Serbs in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> by the majority ethnic Albanians. Adoption of the 34 measures was largely symbolic, since strong opposition is expected when they are submitted to for approval by the legislatures of each of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s six republics and two provinces. The government meanwhile approved price increases of up to 53 percent on meat and 60 percent on bread, two days after <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> eased an unpopular austerity program by allowing salary raises for some workers. The wage increases of between 140 percent and 152 percent for this year will only partially compensate for falling living standards because inflation is now at 217 percent. Meat prices were boosted just three weeks ago. Last year, the government had to cancel sharp increases in bread prices after widespread protests. The economic amendments were designed to help ease a crisis that has reduced living standards by one-half since 1980. They provide for less state interference, greater private and foreign investment and more market mechanisms in the economy, such as closing unprofitable enterprises and sacking unnecessary or undisciplined workers. The moves to give <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> more control over <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and a controversial proposal for army financing are likely to meet particularly stiff resistance in regional legislatures. <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> would increase its control over <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s largely ethnic Albanian judiciary, which Serbs contend is biased against them. The reforms also would require <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> pupils to study according to programs drawn up in <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>. The object is to broaden the non-Albanian cultural background given to ethnic Albanian pupils. <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION>, administratively parts of the republic of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, have strenuously resisted <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> communist leader <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>'s efforts to curtail their autonomy. Serbs have held dozens of massive rallies to voice their support for the constitutional reforms in the past five months, and <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION>'s party leadership was forced to resign this month over the issue. The amendments also would allow the budget of the armed forces to be replenished from funds of the republics in case of a shortfall in the federal budget. The liberal northern republic of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> has refused to endorse the proposal.

The amendments, due to be adopted by <ORGANIZATION> republican </ORGANIZATION> and provincial legislatures by Nov. 29, the national holiday, are seen as an interim solution before a `` new and modern'' constitution is drafted, the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Stipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON>, who holds the annually rotating chairmanship of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, said last week a new draft constitution may be ready for discussion by the next national party congress in 1990.

 <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Montana </PERSON> perfected his A-line chic and <PERSON> Givenchy </PERSON> turned out his peppiest clothes in several seasons during Saturday shows for next summer's ready-to-wear. <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaultier </PERSON>'s collection drew gasps and occasional laughter with designs that ranged from a bawdy-house look to a traveling circus act. Everything was long and beautiful by <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, who showed only a few skirts between trousers shaped like fluid inverted cones. He also showed an occasional pair of wide, cuffed linen shorts. He kept to a muted tone of greys, browns and dusty pinks. The high-waisted trousers he has done before but they never looked better. <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> showed silk jumpsuits and flowing skirts with tops draped in silk chiffon fichus, sometimes off the shoulder. Some toppers had floppy lapels, others had swooped, stitched necklines and natural shoulderlines. The sophisticated outfits also had vest fronts with open backs crossed by straps. Everything was sleek and easy. Jackets often had a long flared look from an easily fitted bodice. Square-necked sundress tops were like trapeze dresses over pants. While all the day clothes were dressy, evening clothes were anything but show-off. Usually in austere black, they had lacquered lace and net cut-outs in the bodices over swirling chiffon skirts. <PERSON> Givenchy </PERSON> delivered a collection to keep his Palm Beach-to-Paris clients happy. There were short skirts and pants or skirt suits came out with a snug silhouette. These silk, smooth wool and pique outfits looked peppy with very wide, white piping all over, creating a clean look in navy with white or yellow. Chunky or big pastille buttons also brightened up the scene. With circular necks and slightly blousing tops, the silk flower-print dresses were completely <PERSON> Givenchy </PERSON>. Even more striking were the widely-striped silks with stand-out capped sleeves, square necks and straight short skirts. <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaultier </PERSON> threw caution to the wind after showing more conventional clothes last season. He sees the upcoming nineties as naughty, with lacy corsets, jackets open to reveal bosoms and shiny tight pants. There was a full line of underwear dressing including a multicolored girdle tunic and a clinging girdle dress with a bra top. The finale was based on multi-suspenders and garters covering the colorful elasticized jersey or satin body suits underneath.

 Leftist guerrillas attacked two small police stations in the south with machine guns and anti-tank rockets, killing a corporal and wounding a local farmer, police said Saturday. They were the first significant terrorist actions since right-wing President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> lost an Oct. 5 referendum on extending his rule to 1997. According to a national police statement, eight guerrillas opened fire Friday night with machine guns and M-16 rifles on a small frontier post in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quenes </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Andes </LOCATION> foothills 20 miles east of the city of <LOCATION> Curico </LOCATION>. The guerrillas then set a police building afire, destroying it and a police jeep, the statement said. It said the gunfire killed a corporal, <PERSON> Juvenal </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON>, and wounded a farmer visiting the post, <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>. An hour earlier, other guerrillas fired two anti-tank rockets at another police post in <LOCATION> Pichipellahuen </LOCATION>, 55 miles southwest of the town of <LOCATION> Traiguen </LOCATION>, the communique said. There were no injuries reported in the attack. The communique blamed both attacks on the communist <ORGANIZATION> Manuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rodriguez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. A spokeswoman for a dissident faction of the front called foreign news agencies in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> to claim responsibility for the actions, saying they represented the start of a `` national patriotic war.'' Interior Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON> called the police officer's death `` an extremely cold terrorist act'' and called on Chileans `` to understand that this country wants to achieve democracy on a peaceful level. <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON> was named Friday, when <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> replaced half of his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>'s 16 members in a shake-up prompted by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s 800,000-ballot loss in his bid to extend his term The 72-year-old army commander seized power in a 1973 coup. Under the constitution, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> remains in power until March 1990. The winner of open elections planned for December 1989 will take over. While swearing in his new ministers, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> firmly rejected opposition calls to step down early and for consitutional reforms. Opposition leaders said his declaration and new Cabinet choices dashed their hopes for prompt negotiations on the reforms. ` The Cabinet is the same, only the names are different,'' said <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaldivar </PERSON>, vice-president of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest. `` It does n't ... reflect the feeling of the immense majority of Chileans who voted ` no' on Oct. 5.'' <PERSON> Zaldivar </PERSON>, however, called on the opposition's ranks to `` keep a cool head and firm nerves'' and not to resort to violent actions. The coalition has repeatedly condemned leftist terrorist actions, saying they provide an excuse for government repression. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagos </PERSON>, a prominent Socialist, noted that two army generals, Public Works Minister <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> Siebert </PERSON> and Economy Minister <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Concha </PERSON>, and a retired navy admiral, Defense Minister <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Carvajal </PERSON>, were retained while generals from the air force and national police were ousted.

 Twelve thousand law officers stood at attention Saturday outside a church where a funeral Mass was held for two city policemen who were shot in separate incidents within hours of each other. Busloads of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> police officers, their shields draped with black mourning bands, were joined outside Our Lady of Perpetual Help church by colleagues from around the state and from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. They stood 10 deep, filling more than six blocks of the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> neighborhood of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. Hundreds of civilians also stood behind police barricades surrounding the church. While the mourners waited outside in chilly, windy weather, a wedding proceeded inside the church _ an event planned nine months ago. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoban </PERSON>, 26, an undercover officer from <PERSON> Bay </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridge </PERSON>, was shot in the head and chest Tuesday night during a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> drug raid. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Buczek </PERSON>, 24, a highly decorated street officer who lived in <LOCATION> Suffern </LOCATION>, was killed less than three hours later while he and his partner pursued a suspect in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>. `` We will never turn this city over to those demons of death who would take all our lives for a few coins of gold,'' Police Commissioner <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> told the mourners. Department officials called it the largest police funeral in city history. It also was the first time in the department's history that a double funeral had been held for officers killed in separate incidents There was silence when two hearses arrived _ broken by the slow beat of drums from the police band. A lone bagpiper played `` Amazing Grace'' while the flag-covered caskets were carried up the church steps. `` It seems fitting for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> and <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> to lie together in this church because they shared so many common bonds,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulto </PERSON> said in an homily. `` Christopher and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> shared a vision that life could be better.'' The mourners included Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Borough President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Borough </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Claire </PERSON> <PERSON> Shulman </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>. At one point during the funeral, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> held his head in his hands and appeared to be sobbing. `` The social contract, even with criminals, was always that you did n't kill cops,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said later in an address to mourners. `` Now, they go out of their way to kill cops.'' In closing, <PERSON> Ulto </PERSON> said, `` I plead to each and every police officer here: please remain faithful to your calling. ... Stand true to what officers <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Buczek </PERSON> and <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoban </PERSON> lived and died for.'' `` There are no words to describe our family's grief,'' the <PERSON> Buczek </PERSON> family said in a written statement. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> gave up his life to fight the war on drugs. `` All we ask is that our nation's local and federal governments support the death penalty and provide the funding necessary to win the drug war.''

<HEAD>Million-Dollar Reward Offered For Identity Of Secret Client _ If</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Relatives of a man who was killed in an unsolved hit-and-run are offering as much as $ 1 million to anyone with information leading to the driver's identity. But the family says that before it can pay off, it first must win a $ 6 million lawsuit against the driver, and his identity apparently is known only to one person, an attorney who has won court permission to keep it secret because of lawyer-client privilege. That lawsuit is pending in <ORGANIZATION> Palm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, while state and private investigators continue trying to track down the driver of the car. The suit was filed in February over the March 9, 1986, crash that killed <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Baltes </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. Attorney <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Krischer </PERSON> says the driver approached him for counsel the day after the accident and he has steadfastly refused to publicly identify him. On Oct. 12, Circuit Judge <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Poulton </PERSON> said <PERSON> Krischer </PERSON> did not have to reveal that information because it is protected by attorney-client confidentiality. `` This criminal is out there laughing at the system, hiding behind the attorney-client privilege,'' says <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Farish </PERSON>, attorney for <PERSON> Baltes </PERSON>' family. He devised the reward plan, announced Friday, `` in order to make incentive for someone to come forward and expedite this mystery.'' <PERSON> Farish </PERSON> conceded that if someone comes forward with information leading to the driver's identity, the tipster would have to wait for a favorable jury verdict in the lawsuit. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubin </PERSON>, who represents <PERSON> Krischer </PERSON>, said he is indifferent to <PERSON> Farish </PERSON>'s tactics, as long as <PERSON> Farish </PERSON> does not trample on the judge's ruling. `` It's really not my concern as long as he and everyone else respects the attorney-client privilege,'' <PERSON> Lubin </PERSON> said. `` Anything that Mr. <PERSON> Farish </PERSON> or the <PERSON> Baltes </PERSON> family will do to help us is welcome,'' said Chief Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Selvig </PERSON>. `` If this helps, we welcome it.''

 The USS Wisconsin, which received a nearly $ 449 million overhaul, was recommissioned Saturday as officials lauded the World War II warship as a mighty defender. `` When the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> was originally commissioned, it was the most powerful warship on the seas,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` With the new modern weapons systems that were ably installed at <ORGANIZATION> Ingalls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION>, it is once again the standard for blue water military strength around the world.'' The USS Wisconsin will join three other World War II battleships that were modernized and returned to service _ the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said the $ 448.8 million refitting was a fraction of the cost of building such a ship from scratch today. But Milwaukee Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON>, who refused to attend the ceremony, disagreed. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> calls this ship a bargain, but a half-billion-dollar battleship is no bargain for <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> taxpayers,'' <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON> said. He said he it was `` incredible that taxpayers have been saddled so much to bring back a ship that's mostly of nostalgic value.'' The <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> is 887 feet long, 108 feet wide and displaces 58,000 tons. It will be based in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, until construction is completed on a new naval base in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. It will have a crew of 1,600.

<TEXT>
 A rare, public rift in the Jewish community, controversy over a political memo and harsh words from <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> have focused attention on <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION>, one of the most powerful lobbying groups on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, referred to as <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION>, is well-known in the corridors of power even though its staff generally stays out of the limelight and prefers to work behind the scenes. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dine </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION>'s executive director, rarely gives interviews, and <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> officials are not regulars on the television and radio talk show circuit. Yet <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> has compiled a stunningly successful record since 1951 in promoting the relationship between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> is the largest recipient of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic and military aid, amounting to $ 3 billion this year. `` It's the strongest lobby in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the strongest lobby in the country,'' said former Rep. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Findley </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> who wrote a book attacking <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> after his defeat in 1982. `` It remains a powerhouse on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> because they have an excellent, highly professional, highly trained staff,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> staff members track legislation and have broad contacts at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and in the White House. <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> and its allies in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have played a large role in opposing the sale of weapons to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, in a speech to an Arab-American group Friday, said congressional opposition to the sale of weapons to moderate Arab countries was costing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` tens of billions of dollars worth of jobs.'' <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, upset that its attempts to buy weapons such as new fighter jets and Maverick antitank missiles from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> often have been stymied by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, recently signed a deal with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to buy more than $ 30 billion worth of weapons. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> did not mention <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> by name, but he criticized `` various interest groups and many in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>'' for trying to block sales to Arab countries. `` The notion that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense cooperation with moderate <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states poses a danger to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is ill-founded and untrue,'' he said. But Rep. <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, D-Calif., a strong backer of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, said, `` Such sales are not in the American interest of peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Findley </PERSON>, in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, said he thinks <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION>'s real power stems from an indirect linkage between the lobby and pro-Israel political action committees controlled by Jewish groups. <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> strenuously denies the allegation and says it does not make political contributions or endorse candidates. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Toby </PERSON> <PERSON> Dershowitz </PERSON> reiterated this position in a letter to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Jewish Week, which had published a story saying the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION> show `` 60 Minutes'' was looking into the relationship between <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> and pro-Israel political action committees. `` ` 60 Minutes' has no new ` evidence' that <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> coordinates or directs PACs,'' she said, adding that earlier allegations fall `` far short of ` proving' any such direction or coordination.'' <PERSON> Dershowitz </PERSON> also disavowed a 1987 memo written by a former junior staffer at the lobbying group to another ex-staffer, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Amouyal </PERSON>. The memo discussed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, describing <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> incumbent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON> as a `` poor supporter of our issue.'' It called for encouragement of the candidacy of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Licht </PERSON>, the state's lieutenant governor who is Jewish. `` No such negative campaign exists'' against <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dershowitz </PERSON> said. While <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> always has been a magnet for criticism from some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the airing of a disagreement in the Jewish community over the lobby's activities was unusual. Six officials of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith complained in a letter that <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> had taken positions that were not in accord with `` the consensus of the organized Jewish community.'' The complaint was in the form of a letter that appeared first in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. The letter said <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> erred in trying to close the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and some Jewish leaders disagreed with <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION>'s opposition to a big <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> arms deal. Last week, the groups tried to paper over any differences with <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION>. They issued a statement in which they pledged to be `` fully supportive'' of <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION>'s work. The three groups were among the founding members of <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> in 1951. Some of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s supporters on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> also played down the significance of any rift. `` Do all Jews have the same opinion on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>? No,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass. But that does n't translate into an overall lessening of support for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, he said. Although <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> officials `` generally do a good job,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said, `` I think they sometimes tend to overkill.'' `` The Jewish community is not homogeneous,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., who said, `` I do n't think it is anything but healthy to have different points of view'' on issues But Rep. <PERSON> Mervyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Dymally </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> and an <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> critic, said the open disagreement could weaken the lobby because when `` leaders begin to speak out ... then <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> will moderate their views. <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION>'s money comes from its 50,000 members who sent contributions. The group, which has a staff of about 70, will operate with a budget of $ 6.6 million this year, <PERSON> Dershowitz </PERSON> said. Six people registered as lobbyists for <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> between April and July this year. Lobbying reports filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> show that Dine and <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION>'s chief lobbyist, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloomfield </PERSON>, each earned about $ 21,000 in the second quarter of 1988. Meantime, former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchetti </PERSON> and author <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said they have asked the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to investigate whether <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> should be registered as a lobby for a foreign government under the 1938 Foreign Agents Registration Act. Department spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said the agency determined in the 1970s that <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> was not required to register because none of its money came from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

According to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> holds 50,182 Iraqi POWs and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> holds 19,284 Iranians. But <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials and diplomats place the figures much higher, saying <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> holds 60,000-70 ,000 and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> 30,000-50 The Iraqi spokesman said the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> was asked to send a delegation to organize the new repatriation, according to the news agency report monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. It said he called on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to reciprocate and claimed that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> `` had all along dealt with the POW issue as a political one in order to exploit it for the purposes of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s expansionist policies.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> commentary on Saturday welcomed <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s planned release of prisoners but said real progress on the issue would only come through quicker peace negotiations. It also accused <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of waffling on the issue, claiming <PERSON> Irdaq </PERSON> first said it would not exchange prisoners within the framework of U.N. Resolution 598 but later supported elements of that plan. The resolution is the basis for the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the 8-year-long war. The commentary, monitored by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was ready to exchange prisoners of war.

 More than 100 anti-abortion protesters were arrested in <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, on Saturday, while a noisy, rain-soaked protest in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> drew as many counterdemonstrators as demonstrators. The crowd of protesters in front of the Summit Women's Center in <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION> delayed the opening of the clinic for more than an hour, witnesses said. `` The goal was to save babies' lives,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Chuvala </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, who helped organize the protest for the <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pro-Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. `` If some mother decided not to have an abortion because of our presence there, then yes, we've accomplished our goal. Police originally said 131 people were arrested by midday, but later revised that total to 103 adults and four juveniles. Officer <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Peeler </PERSON> said the adults were released on written promises to appear in Superior Court later, and the juveniles were released into the custody of their parents, she said. <PERSON> Chuvala </PERSON> said there were about 50 people taking part in the protest who were not arrested, bringing the total number of participants to about 160. There were far fewer arrests in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, where about 300 people turned out. Activists on both sides of the issue each claimed they had more supporters in the crowd. `` They may be able to get away with this in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, but they are not going to do this in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, an organizer of the pro-choice counter-protest. Since July, large anti-abortion protests in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> have resulted in hundreds of arrests. Deputy <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> police superintendent <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Conway </PERSON> said three abortion opponents were arrested on disorderly conduct charges as they sat on the sidewalk in front of the downtown Gynacare clinic. About 30 helmeted officers stood shoulder to shoulder in front of the clinic to clear a path for arriving patients. No staff members or patients with appointments for abortions were denied entry, said a clinic spokeswoman who would identify herself only as <PERSON> Karla </PERSON>. But she added that there was no way of knowing if any women were discouraged from coming in for unscheduled pregnancy tests. `` We are not here to get arrested, to close buildings, to make an issue,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>, a Presbyterian minister from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> who helped organize the recent demonstrations there and was advising the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> protest. `` We are here to save children who are going to be killed,'' <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Tess </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON>, another organizer of the pro-choice counter-protest, said, `` It's not so much that they are pro-fetus, they are anti-women. These people are trying to win back by disruptive tactics the moral rights that they could n't win by legitimate means.'' In <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Chuvala </PERSON> had declined to identify in advance which of about a dozen clinics in the state would be the target of Saturday's action because `` we need an element of surprise.'' After the protest began at the clinic in <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>, a woman who answered the telephone at the center said, `` I'm sorry, we do n't have anything to say. Earlier, a coalition of abortion providers in the state had vowed to do everything possible to keep open whatever clinic was hit by the protest.

 A Shiite Moslem leader said Saturday that kidnappers holding foreign hostages and threatening to hurt the American ones were committing an `` unforgivable crime.'' <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, who heads the mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia, spoke in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> after the Islamic Jihad, a pro-Iranian fundamentalist faction, warned it would punish <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hostages it is holding. The Islamic Jihad threat was in retaliation for Friday's Israeli air raids on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> that killed 21 people and injured 34. Officials had said 16 people were killed in the attacks but police reported five more bodies were found in the rubble Saturday in the southeastern town of <LOCATION> Mashgara </LOCATION>, one of the main targets of the Israeli raids. Israeli warplanes flew over the pro-Iranian stronghold of <LOCATION> Baalbek </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> Saturday but no attacks were reported. <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>'s Syrian-backed militia has been locked in a fierce struggle with pro-Iranian fundamentalists for mastery of the Shiite community. It has no influence on the kidnappers. In <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, police said Saturday they arrested a Lebanese woman at the airport who was carrying pictures of three American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in a false bottom in her suitcase. The woman stopped Thursday was carrying photos of <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alann </PERSON> <PERSON> Steen </PERSON> to be given to an Italian businessman, said <PERSON> Fortunato </PERSON> <PERSON> Finoli </PERSON>, deputy director of the <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> police anti-terrorist unit. She also carried a handwritten letter signed by <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>, he said. She was arrested and charged with carrying $ 1,000 in counterfeit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bills and 50 grams of heroin, <PERSON> Finoli </PERSON> said. Police refused to say who was to ultimately receive the pictures and documents, or why they were being sent. They said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy was notified. <PERSON> Finoli </PERSON> said the woman, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> identified as <PERSON> Aline </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizkalah </PERSON>, 36, was arrested before Islamic Jihad, or Islamic holy war, threatened the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages Friday and accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of giving <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> advance approval of the air attack. In <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> said Lebanese `` are against <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s policy, against <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s support of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and against the American administration. But we are not at all against the American citizens.'' He called the kidnapping `` an unjustified, unforgivable crime.'' In its statement, the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION> said: `` The criminal <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> must realize it will not get away with what it has done, especially in connection with the hostages we hold.'' The group holds <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, acting dean of agriculture at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> is the longest-held foreign hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985. <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Collins </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, was seized three months later. The Jan. 24, 1987 abduction of <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>, a teacher at <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, has been claimed by the pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. They are among nine Americans believed held by pro-Iranian extremist factions linked to <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, the main militia challenging <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>'s Amal among <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Shiites. Others believed held are three Britons, an Irishman and an Italian. Asked if he believed the foreign hostages would be released soon, <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> said that would happen `` only if deals were struck between the kidnappers and the hostages' governments.'' In <LOCATION> Mashgara </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday buried eight air raid victims. About 1,500 mourners shouted `` Death to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the great Satan!'' and `` Death to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>!'' as they paraded flag-draped coffins through the streets. `` The more you kill us the more we will fight!''

 The racketeering indictment of former <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> signals the start of a lengthy legal process that is likely to include several rounds of plea bargaining with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Even if <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and the government do n't work out a deal that would spare both sides the expense of a trial, it could easily be a year or more before <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> would face a jury. Federal prosecutors allege <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> embezzled more than $ 100 million from the Philippine government and used the money to buy three buildings in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The main charge carries a maximum prison sentence of 20 years. `` Paradoxical as it may seem, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> and I welcome the opportunity to show the whole world that these allegations of dishonesty and criminal activity can not be proven by our accusers. We are confident that we will be vindicated,'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said in a statement released Saturday by his spokesman, Gemmo <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION>. As part of what they promise will be a vigorous defense, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' lawyers will embark on an extensive legal process of pre-trial discovery that is likely to involve a demand for a massive review of administration records for any documents suggesting <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was offered assurances he would n't be prosecuted if he came to this country Whether any such records exist, the check for them and the discovery process in general will take a long time. In <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> on Friday, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> referred to the matter indirectly, saying President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was responsible for <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> being brought to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> considered himself loyal to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and expected some loyalty in return, including safe haven in this country. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was president of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> for 20 years and a close ally of a succession of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administrations until he fled into exile in February 1986. <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> also said his client's health will be a major factor in the case. Although he said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, 71, is willing to attend his arraignment either in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> by Oct. 31, where <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife would plead innocent, <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> described <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' state as `` frail.'' `` I am personally concerned ... that he may not be physically able to withstand the rigors of a criminal trial of this scope and magnitude,'' said <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> spokesman, said Saturday that `` even at the expense of his life, if he has to go to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, he'll go. The most important thing is not life, but honor and he will defend his honor any place.'' In the 2 -LCB- years <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has lived in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, he has been treated for a variety of illnesses, including chest pains and an eye ailment. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' lawyers showed no enthusiasm with the deal the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> offered prior to his indictment, possibly pointing to a drawn-out process of negotiation in the future. Calling the pre-indictment offer `` a set of non-negotiable'' demands, <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> had been instructed to accept or reject a deal that would have required him and his wife to plead guilty to felony racketeering charges and testify against others with no assurances <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> would not be jailed. And <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' lawyers are showing no reluctance to publicly dispute information being put out by the government about the case. One <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tigue </PERSON>, flatly rejected the notion that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' lawyers had n't responded to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s demands that he enter a guilty plea Federal sources said Thursday that the lawyers had n't responded by a 5 p.m. EDT deadline. <PERSON> Tigue </PERSON> said there had been miscommunication, that the deadline had been 5:30 p.m. and that the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' lawyers had responded in time, rejecting the offer. `` Of course we would n't let the deadline go by'' without responding, said <PERSON> Tigue </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> decision to face indictment rather than plead guilty to a crime also raises another intriguing question: How much political damage might he inflict? A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> cable that leaked out earlier this month touches on the potential problem. It says, in part, that an indictment may prompt a vindictive <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to `` seek to involve and embarrass'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> officials by making allegations of improper or illegal conduct, `` however unfounded'' in an attempt to adversely affect relations with the current <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government. The cable does n't elaborate. In another development, a congressman confirmed early Saturday that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> recently was subpoenaed to testify before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. Rep. <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he signed the subpoena after it was requested by the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> affairs subcommittee <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON> declined to discuss what the panel wants to question <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> about, but The Virgininian-Pilot and the Ledger-Star, newspapers in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, reported from their <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bureaus that it involves long-standing allegations that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> funneled millions of dollars into the 1980 and 1984 presidential campaigns of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, television station <ORGANIZATION> KHON </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> as confirming that the subpoena had been served. `` I understand it's for his appearance today -LRB- Oct. 21 -RRB- in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> told the station. `` That's not going to happen.''

 Troops shot and wounded 12 Palestinians on Saturday in scattered clashes in the occupied territories, hospital officials said. The army said a soldier was injured when he was struck in the head by a rock. Also Saturday, 21-year-old Lt. <PERSON> Moti </PERSON> <PERSON> Shtaier </PERSON> died of wounds suffered Wednesday when a suicide car bomb exploded in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the army said. His death raised the number of Israeli troops killed in the explosion to eight. Two other soldiers were hospitalized in critical condition. The bombing prompted Israeli air raids over southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> Friday that killed 21 people and injured 34. Police initially said 16 people were killed but reported five more bodies were found in rubble in the southeastern Lebanese town of <LOCATION> Mashgara </LOCATION>, one of the main targets of the raids. Most of Saturday's rioting in the occupied territories was confined to the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where 650,000 Palestinians live, many in refugee camps. The army placed curfews on <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s Nusseirat refugee camp and a <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> neighborhood after violent protests, a military spokesman said. Hospital officials said troops shot a 23-year-old resident in the leg with a plastic bullet. The spokesman confirmed only one of the 12 wounded, identifying him as a 16-year-old <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> boy shot and wounded by a plastic bullet. Demonstrators stoned the army headquarters in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s Jabaliya refugee camp, an Arab reporter said. Soldiers responded with plastic bullets, shooting and wounding a 20-year-old man in the leg, the reporter and hospital officials said. The hospital officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said another Jabaliya man in his 20s was severely beaten by club-wielding soldiers. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s town of <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION>, protesters burned tires at the open-air market and hurled stones, slightly injuring a soldier, the reporter said. Troops fired tear gas and plastic bullets to disperse the crowd, shooting and wounding a 13-year-old boy in the leg and a 46-year-old man in the hand, the reporter said. Five others were shot and wounded by plastic bullets in other protests, the reporter said. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, troops fired live ammunition to disperse a crowd, wounding a 15-year-old Palestinian in the leg and a 16-year-old in the stomach, hospital officials said. The officials said an 18-year-old Palestinian from <LOCATION> Salfit </LOCATION> village was brought to the hospital with a bullet wound to the stomach. The 10-month Palestinian revolt against Israeli rule of the territories, captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> War, has claimed the lives of 301 Palestinians and six Israelis. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, some 500 supporters of U.S.-born Rabbi <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> held a rally Saturday night to protest the exclusion of the ultra-right-wing parliament member from the upcoming elections Nov. 1. The parliament's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> barred <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> from running for office because of his racist views. `` Arabs are a cancer in our midst,'' <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> told the crowd, who chanted, `` Death to the Arabs'' and waved yellow flags with the Kahane emblem, a fist inside a black Star of <PERSON> David </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> advocates expelling all Arabs from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

 The government said Saturday that it wants Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> to meet with the interior minister to remove obstacles to upcoming top-level talks with the opposition. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> last week refused a request for such a meeting, but the government continues to hope he will meet with Interior Minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said. At an unusual meeting with reporters, <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said problems remain over the participants, date and site of the talks. But he strongly denied that the government was backing out of its promise to discuss <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s future with the opposition. `` I state tat we have wanted from the beginning and still want the round-table to begin as quickly as possible,'' he said. `` The round-table is our initiative, not anyone else's.'' Solidarity, the first independent trade union movement in the Soviet bloc, responded with a communique saying the insistence on another Walesa-Kiszczak meeting was a discouraging development. `` This mounting of difficulties and the fact that nothing can as of today be recognized as settled gives a very pessimistic prognosis,'' said the statement. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> confirmed he turned down a proposed meeting with <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, an army general who agreed with <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> to hold the talks in a meeting Aug. 31 during a wave of strikes in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. After getting the promise for the talks on the possible legalization of Solidarity and union pluralism, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> quickly halted <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s worst strike wave since Solidarity was crushed in the 1981 martial law crackdown. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, speaking from his home in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, said he refused another meeting with <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> `` because a meeting on personnel problems makes no sense. I wo n't permit any personnel changes'' in Solidarity's proposed delegation. `` I like the general very much, and I am ready -LRB- to talk -RRB-, but the talk can not concern personnel problems or problems of Solidarity and pluralism,'' he said. `` This is all for the round-table.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said the opposition could start the talks immediately if the government agreed. `` I'm not going to travel and talk without a purpose, but I'm ready to talk about the important things,'' he said Urban said: `` There are various problems: who should issue invitations, where it takes place, how many working groups there will be. ... We also need to discuss and remove controversies concerning the personnel composition. `` We strongly appeal -LRB- to the opposition -RRB- not to avoid the necessary preparatory work so that the round-table can finally meet,'' Urban said. <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> mediator <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Stelmachowski </PERSON>, who met with Politiburo member <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Czyrek </PERSON> on Saturday, said only one major obstacle remained. He said the government seeks to remove two people from Solidarity's proposed delegation to the talks. Urban previously said there were problems with the proposed participation of longtime Solidarity advisers <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON>, who in the government's view advocate the overthrow of communism.

 Stormy weather spread heavy rain, wind and cold air across parts of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> on Saturday, with snow at some higher elevations, while high wind whistled across parts of the <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>. A strong low pressure system over the southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> coast spread rain over much of the region during the night and into Saturday morning. During the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT, 1.70 inches of rain fell at <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>; with 1.50 at <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>; and 1.05 inches at <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION> Colder air poured in behind the low and changed the rain to wet snow over parts of south-central and northeastern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state and over most of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>.

 Authorities detained the captain of an Italian freighter and accused him of ramming a Greek cruise ship in an accident that killed two <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> seamen, injured 54 passengers and left two people missing. Italian officials on Saturday denied the Greek allegation and said the freighter was at a standstill before the crash. Officials had reported a British teen-ager was missing and feared dead after Friday's accident and on Saturday sponsors of the tour of British students said a teacher also could not be accounted for. Schools Abroad, the London-based organizer of the trip, identified the missing student as <PERSON> Vivien </PERSON> <PERSON> Barley </PERSON>, 14, of <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> <PERSON> Confield </PERSON>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and the teacher as <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Butt </PERSON> from the T.P. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> Community in <LOCATION> Walsall </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The collision involved the freighter Adige and the 6,300-ton Jupiter, which was carrying 486 British students and teachers. Most of the schoolchildren arrived in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Saturday for tearful reunions with their families. The crash tore a gaping hole in the port side of the Jupiter, which sank less than a mile from shore. All others aboard the Jupiter were rescued, and no injuries were reported from the Adige. Italian officials denied Greek claims that the Adige was at fault. `` The responsibility for the collision is that of the captain of the Adige, who, through criminal negligence, threw his ship into the left side of the Jupiter,'' said <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s merchant marine minister, <PERSON> Evangelos </PERSON> <PERSON> Yannopoulos </PERSON>. The Adige, a container ship owned by <ORGANIZATION> Sicula </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SPA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Siosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Line </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>, ignored warnings from the <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>'s skipper as it was manuevering to dock, said <PERSON> Spyros </PERSON> <PERSON> Mavrikis </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Epirotiki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, the Jupiter's owner Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, returning to <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> Saturday after undergoing heart surgery in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, told reporters before his departure that `` it was a question of the captain not knowing what he was doing.'' But Adige Capt. <PERSON> Flavio </PERSON> <PERSON> Caminale </PERSON>, being being held in the port city of <LOCATION> Piraeus </LOCATION> on manslaughter charges, said the Greek ship was to blame. `` We were stopped outside the <LOCATION> Piraeus </LOCATION> port, waiting for the pilot so we could go in,'' <PERSON> Caminale </PERSON> said in a telephone interview with <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s RAI television network. `` The pilot was coming towards me. At a certain point, I saw the cruise ship leaving port ... `` Probably the wind pushed it, and I found it coming upon me. So when I realized after a few seconds that this ship was coming at me, I ordered the engines in reverse ... and, at the last moment, when he -LRB- the cruise ship -RRB- saw that he could n't pass, he violently tacked to starboard. And in so turning himself, he struck my prow.'' In <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the Adige `` had been at a standstill for 10 minutes when Capt. Caminale spotted the Jupiter leaving port, and realized promptly that it was on a collision course.'' `` The captain of the Italian ship immediately ordered its engines to reverse direction,'' the communique said. There was not enough time for the order to be carried out, said 2nd Lt. <PERSON> Enrico </PERSON> <PERSON> Costantini </PERSON> at the ministry's operations center. Asked if the Greek ship had struck the Italian vessel, he said, `` I think so. That is what it appears at this moment.'' Students and teachers were flown back to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> Saturday aboard four chartered jets. Some were still wrapped in blankets and many wept as they boarded the jets. A government spokesman said three people remained hospitalized in stable condition. The 471 teen-agers and their 15 teachers and chaperones were starting an 8-day educational cruise when the collision occurred 20 minutes after the Jupiter left port. According to <PERSON> Mavrikis </PERSON> and port officials, the Adige's bulbous nose rammed the cruise ship amidships below the waterline. `` Its prow tore a gash all the way up to the boat deck and the engine room flooded. The tug boats managed to keep the ship afloat while it was evacuated,'' <PERSON> Mavrikis </PERSON> said. Thirty-two vessels took part in a 25-minute rescue operation. The Jupiter slid underwater 40 minutes after the crash.

<TEXT>
 Tens of thousands of Lithuanians carrying torches and their national flag marched Saturday to a cathedral the Soviet government said it will return to the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. The procession began immediately after a Lithuanian nationalist group was told the government had acceded to demands to return the 14th <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vilnius </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> to its original use. The Vilnius Cathedral was a center of Christianity in the Middle Ages and its confiscation by the officially atheist Soviet government had angered many Lithuanians. `` It's been so many years, I just ca n't believe it,'' a 67-year-old Catholic woman said. The woman, who marched as the scent of burning candles and torches filled the air, said she had prayed at the cathedral as a girl before it was converted into an art museum in 1950. The announcement came at the end of the first day of a two-day conference of the <ORGANIZATION> Lithuanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Restructuring </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, a broadly backed group that is considering the most militant nationalist demands yet from the three Soviet Baltic republics. `` The Lithuanian government has decided to return the <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> Cathedral to believers as of Oct. 22,'' an official of the movement told more than 1,000 delegates and hundreds of guests assembled in the Vilnius Sports Palace. Members of the audience took to their feet, clapping and cheering in the direction of the republic's new reform-minded <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, <PERSON> Algirdas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brazauskas </PERSON>. On Friday, <PERSON> Brazauskas </PERSON> told a news conference that services would be allowed in the cathedral every Sunday and that another church converted into a museum would be returned to its original use in March. But Catholic officials were not satisfied and said they would boycott the <ORGANIZATION> Vilnius </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> until it was completely turned back to the church. An estimated 4 million Roman Catholics live in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, about half of them in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>. The return of the cathedral was the latest in what many Lithuanians consider a dizzying period of change in the republic. <PERSON> Brazauskas </PERSON> is a product of that change. He was named to head the party just two days ago, replacing <PERSON> Ringaudas </PERSON> <PERSON> Songaila </PERSON>, a conservative who had expressed only lukewarm support for the restructuring group. <PERSON> Brazauskas </PERSON> had no reservations. `` I'm sorry to say that in its evaluation of the movement, there were mistakes, and some were also made by the -LRB- party -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Brazauskas </PERSON> told the 1,100 delegates in a speech. The 56-year-old official stood on a stage in the Sports Palace in front of a huge banner bearing the yellow, green and red stripes of the flag of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s brief independence between World Wars I and II. The flag was banned until this month. <PERSON> Brazauskas </PERSON>, who was interrupted repeatedly by applause during his 20-minute address, met with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> last week and said the Soviet president believes the Lithuanian group can help perestroika, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s plan to restructure society. In his speech, <PERSON> Brazauskas </PERSON> expanded the list of reforms planned at the request of nationalist activists. He said a nationalist monument in <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> that was destroyed under Soviet dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> will be rebuilt. Victims of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s repressions will be rehabilitated and they or their survivors compensated, he said, and `` all the blank spots'' in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s history will be cleared up. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> took control of the independent Baltic states in 1940 under a secret pact with <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Activists in all three republics are demanding that authorities renounce the pact. In draft resolutions up for a vote over at the meeting, the Lithuanian group said the 1940 takeover was an `` unlawful occupation'' and that the republic `` reserves its right to withdraw from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' Groups in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> have adopted similar resolutions. But in several respects, the Lithuanian measures are more radical. In its draft resolutions, the movement says defense and foreign policy should be handled jointly by the republic and the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>. It says Lithuanians should have the right to perform compulsory military service in their republic and to set up their own diplomatic missions abroad. The movement was formed in June and claims 180,000 supporters among the republic's 3.6 million people.

 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> praised <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials Saturday for indicting <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> on racketeering charges and said that could deter dictators from robbing the people and seeking asylum abroad. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> also said that former President <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' trial in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would hasten recovery of his ` hidden wealth'' _ billions of dollars her administration claims <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> obtained during his 20-year rule. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, who have lived in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> since he was ousted in February 1986, were indicted in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Friday on charges that could send them to jail for 20 years if found guilty. They were charged along with eight associates. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> alleges that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife embezzled at least $ 103 million in government funds including <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid and funneled the money to secret bank accounts in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries. The couple then allegedly used the money to buy valuable <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> properties, the indictment says. `` This -LRB- indictment -RRB- is certainly welcome news in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and I commend this evident commitment to the rule of law abroad,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said in a statement read by her press secretary, <PERSON> Teodoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON>. `` I hope that this and other similar efforts undertaken in other countries to investigate the crimes of the Marcoses will lead to the early recovery of the stolen assets that rightfully belong to the Filipino people,'' the statement added. `` Significantly, also, the fact that the Marcoses are being brought to justice will serve as a powerful deterrent to all those who believe themselves above the law and those who would abuse the public trust for private gain.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government has accused the Marcoses of stealing up to $ 10 billion in public and private assets during his rule and hiding the wealth in real estate, shares of stock, works of art, jewelry and bank accounts around the world. News reports on the indictment came too late for <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s newspapers Saturday but most bannered reports from the previous day that the Marcoses were about to be criminally charged Political commentator <PERSON> Belinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> _ no relation to the president _ said in a front-page article in the Philippine Daily Inquirer it was ironic that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was being prosecuted for violating <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> laws and not for crimes committed in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. `` But what does it matter?'' she said. `` The important thing is that the law has caught up with this rascal at last.'' Officials said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' trial in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would delay his prosecution here even further, but noted the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trial could result in the recovery of some of the `` ill-gotten wealth.'' Although it has repeatedly said it will file criminal charges against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> government has not done so for fear <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> would insist on returning to defend himself. The constitution forbids trial in absentia.

<TEXT>
 The stage has been set for a complex land swap involving the 111-acre <ORGANIZATION> Phoenix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> campus and more than 100,000 acres of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> swampland. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved legislation concerning the swap on Thursday. The bill authorizes the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to dispose of the school, which the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration wants to close because of declining enrollments. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative wing of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, has described the downtown <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> land as perhaps the most valuable undeveloped piece of urban real estate in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. Under the plan, the <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> family interests of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> will get 68.4 acres of the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> property in exchange for the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> acreage and a cash payment of at least $ 34.9 million. The transaction also calls for the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to get 11.5 acres of the school property to expand its <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> hospital; <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> to get 20 acres for a park; and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> to get 4.5 acres for a veterans home. The rest of the land is tied up in road rights-of-way. The money paid by the <ORGANIZATION> Colliers </ORGANIZATION> will be placed into a trust fund for the education of Indians in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> land will be used to provide a buffer around the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> and to provide habitat for endangered species, such as the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> panther. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 316-32 approval of a package of bills in which the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> deal was included. The measure was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> a week ago, but was approved again by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> later Thursday and sent to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for his signature. The new <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote was necessitated by a minor change made by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of British children rescued after a ship collision off <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> returned home Saturday for tearful reunions with their families but the trip organizer said one child and a teacher were missing. The missing child, 14-year-old <PERSON> Vivien </PERSON> <PERSON> Barley </PERSON> of <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> <PERSON> Confield </PERSON>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, was presumed dead, according to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. It had been reported she was the only one of the 486 students and teachers in the group not found. However, the organizer of the trip, Schools Abroad, announced Saturday evening that teacher <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Butt </PERSON> from T.P. <ORGANIZATION> Riley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Walsall </LOCATION>, central <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, was also missing. `` All we know is several -LRB- pupils -RRB- say he helped them out of the boat following the accident and was last seen by them helping children out of the boat, as is typical,'' said school headmaster <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. `` Since then, there is simply no information, and obviously we are very, very concerned,'' he said in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. However, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Epirotiki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, owners of the Greek cruise ship Jupiter that carried the British travelers, said later, on condition of anonymity: `` I know this man is alive and well. I have spoken to him myself.'' `` He was accounted for earlier today; now he is not,'' a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said, also on condition of anonymity. `` He certainly did not board any of the planes to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>.'' An Italian freighter collided Friday with the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> cruise ship carrying the British children and teachers off the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> port city of <LOCATION> Piraeus </LOCATION>. Two Greek seamen aboard the Jupiter were killed, and 54 passengers were injured. The cruise ship sank. Greek authorities detained the captain of the Italian freighter Adige and accused him of being responsible for the accident. The rescued children flew home aboard four chartered <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 jets to <LOCATION> Stansted </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gatwick </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> airports and rushed into the arms of their parents. Some of the injured passengers remained behind in Greek hospitals. Some youngsters _ rumpled, pale and still wrapped in blankets _ burst into tears at the sight of their families. One father collapsed at <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> as he waited for his daughter to arrive. He was taken to a hospital. Some children were unable to speak, but others poured out their stories. Teacher <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Embrey </PERSON> described the children as `` magnificent, absolutely fantastic. If it had been adults, I do not think we would have got as many off the ship as we did. `` Some of the children could not swim and others were afraid to jump ... Once we were in the water, all we could do was to swim like the devil.'' <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillon </PERSON>, 19, said he escaped from the sinking ship as it tilted almost vertically in the sea. `` It went up on one side, stood up, and then I realized we just had to get off,'' he said. `` But there was one girl, <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Korb </PERSON>, who would not come with me. She would not let go so I tried to talk her down. `` She would not let go of the ladder, so in the end I had to pull her hands off.'' His tearful mother, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillon </PERSON>, clung to her son as he told his tale. `` Until I heard he was safe, I could n't cry,'' she said.

 <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Puffe </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, separated from his wife, wanted to be with his two little boys. Now, he sits in an isolated jail cell with a wound healing on his neck. He slashed his throat and lived. Police say he slashed the throats of <PERSON> Timmy </PERSON>, 3, and <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON>, 2. They were buried Saturday. The 29-year-old father was charged last week with two counts of first-degree murder, but a judge granted him permission Thursday to see the boys one final time before their funerals. <PERSON> Puffe </PERSON> and his 27-year-old wife, <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON>, were getting a divorce and custody of the boys was going to be a major issue. She and the children had moved out in August and a temporary court order let <PERSON> Puffe </PERSON> have the children on Sundays. <PERSON> Puffe </PERSON> was being held in lieu of $ 500,000 cash bail in a cell equipped with a television monitor where officers `` are watching him a bit more closely'' than other inmates, said Chief Deputy <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Andraschko </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Waupaca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> will not have died in vain if we would see children as a gift from God and not pawns in the lives and desires of adults,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gauerke </PERSON> told about 100 mourners Saturday at <ORGANIZATION> Trinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. The church pastor urged family and friends to reflect on the `` joy and unending enthusiasm and vitality'' of the boys and to forgive their father. The killings Oct. 15 left people stunned in the neighborhood of neat lawns, no fences and well-kept, ranch-style homes. Basketball hoops, bicycles and swing sets adorn many yards in this community of about 6,200 about 40 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. `` Everybody has kids. It's just a neighborhood full of kids,'' said next-door neighbor <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bodah </PERSON>. `` You can tell it kind of bothers the kids.'' The boys' mother and police found them in the house after Mrs. <PERSON> Puffe </PERSON> received a phone call from her estranged husband. Mrs. <PERSON> Puffe </PERSON>'s daughter from a previous marriage, sleeping in another bedroom, was unharmed. In a letter police found addressed to Mrs. <PERSON> Puffe </PERSON>, the father wondered what his wife would joke about, `` now that I'm gone and I took my little men with me,'' according to a criminal complaint. Neighbors and relatives described <PERSON> Puffe </PERSON> as a devoted father who often worked 70 hours a week as a farmhand but spent every spare moment with his sons. In a signed statement to police, <PERSON> Puffe </PERSON> said he drank about a fourth of a quart of rum and wrote a note to his wife after putting the children to bed. He took a knife from a kitchen drawer and lay down on the bed where the two boys were, according to the statement filed in circuit court. `` I cut <PERSON> Timmy </PERSON> first across the neck, I cut <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> across the neck right away, across the neck both the same way,'' the statement said. He called his wife and told her, `` I just killed the boys,'' then returned to the bedroom and lay between his sons, according to the statement. `` With my right hand -LRB- I -RRB- cut my own throat,'' the statement said. `` I wanted to be with my boys.'' Police spoke twice with <PERSON> Puffe </PERSON> by telephone and he told them there was no problem in the house. A third call went unanswered and an officer looking through windows saw a man's figure lay down on a bed, sit back up, fall sideways and crawl down a hall. <PERSON> Puffe </PERSON> crawled out the front door of the home. He was hospitalized for a day and then went to jail.

Their summit was held with a view toward <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s parliamentary elections on Nov. 1 and a session of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which acts as the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament, on Nov. 12. `` This meeting aims at coordinating Arab positions so we can move forward quickly to convening an international peace conference,'' <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> told reporters after meeting with King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and Egyptian President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>. `` We want the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> voter ... to determine his interests before the November election,'' said <PERSON> Osama </PERSON> <PERSON> Baz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s chief political adviser, when asked about the summit's significance. `` It is important for him -LRB- the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> voter -RRB- to know that there is an <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> partner who is ready for peace,'' <PERSON> Baz </PERSON> told reporters. `` If he does not want it, we will have something else to say.'' In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, a spokesman for Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, denounced the <LOCATION> Aqaba </LOCATION> conference, calling it an attempt to influence the Israeli election.

In July, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> renounced <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s claims to the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and curtailed his nation's longstanding administrative ties with the occupied territories. He previously terminated joint efforts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to arrange peace talks with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> last visited <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> for an Arab summit in November 1987. He told reporters he still supports the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s commitment to a confederation between <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and an independent Palestinian state. He said he would give the 450-member <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> four options: Declaring a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state under occupation, a provisional state and government, a provisional government alone, or asking temporary international protection for the occupied territories. Aides said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> planned to leave Sunday.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is expected to sign a broad ranging anti-drug bill that calls for stiff penalties for drug dealers including the death sentence in some cases involving drug-related murders. The bill, characterized by Sen. Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., as `` bad news for drug dealers and their customers,'' was approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> early Saturday `` This is a very strong bill. The message is simple. Do n't do drugs. The country will not tolerate it,'' declared <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. The bill calls for creation of a Cabinet-level `` drug czar'' that would coordinate all aspects of the federal government's war against illegal drugs. It also calls for stiffer penalties and a variety of other sanctions, including loss of some federal benefits and civil fines, for drug violations. White House spokeswoman <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said she did not know when the president will sign the legislation, adding that the bill had not yet been sent over to the White House. Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, one of the principle sponsors of the legislation, said Saturday he expects <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to sign the bill swiftly. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> worked late into the night to enact the legislation that many congressmen and senators wanted in time for the final days of their re-election campaigns. A dispute over proposed anti-obscenity language _ sought by conservatives, but labeled unconstitutional by many liberals and moderates _ held up the vote until the early morning hours Saturday. The matter was worked out when it was agreed to create a new obscenity trafficking offense and the House went on to approve the overall legislation on a 346-11 vote. Two hours later the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed the measure with a voice vote. The bill would allow up to a $ 10,000 civil fine for possession of even small quantities of drugs intended for personal use and could, beginning in September, lead to the loss of student loans and other federal benefits for anyone convicted of drug possession. Drug kingpins and others who kill or order killings while committing drug-related felonies could be executed under a federal death penalty provision in the legislation. Other provisions of the bill would: _ Require for the first time health warning labels on alcoholic beverages _ Toughen child pornography laws, including creation of penalties for anyone who aids in the use of a child for producing sexually explicit materials _ Establishes a one-year pilot program for drug testing of new drivers' license applicants _ Expands the government's role in drug treatment, prevention and research programs _ Allows the president to impose sanctions against countries involved in laundering drug money Because of continuing disagreements among some legislators, provisions that would have required random drug testing for transportation workers and those with safety-related jobs at nuclear facilities were left out of the legislation. In <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Micky </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadoff </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Mothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drunk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Driving </ORGANIZATION>, called the legislation `` a fantastic success'' because of its provisions involving alcohol.

 A shootout on the packed midway of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> State Fair sent thousands of fairgoers fleeing in panic and ended with one dead and three wounded, authorities said Saturday. `` I heard two or three shots and people in the center _ in the middle _ started running in every direction,'' said <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>, 37, of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, who was high above the midway on a ferris wheel. `` After that, you could see people in different spots just running like crazy _ just getting away from this area.'' Many bystanders were knocked down or trampled in Friday night's panic, and several pregnant women went into labor, officials said One police officer was among the wounded and two other police officers were injured in related scuffles, officials said. `` All I know is it got wild out there real fast,'' said police Cpl. D.H. Boy, who was treated for bruises suffered while arresting a young man with a gun in his waistband. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON>, director of communication for the fair, said the shooting probably would have little effect on the fair, in its last weekend. `` This is n't the first time'' someone has been shot at a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> State Fair, she said. `` I've been at the fair more than 15 years. This is not the first time there's been an incident, and I've never seen it affect attendance before.'' She also said the fair's directors would discuss handling of the shooting and the panic on the midway as part of their general review of the fair. The police presence at the fair was boosted this year and as of Thursday, crime at the fair was down by 26 percent over last year, police officials said. During the 1985 fair, 230 offenses were reported including 57 rapes, murders, assaults and robberies. The shooting followed a brawl between black and Hispanic fair-goers, one corporal said, but investigators were unsure whether gang fights were involved or if the brawl and shootings were connected. The shots and panic apparently began with a shooting near a restroom, said police Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Holt </PERSON>. Officer J.T. <PERSON> Dailey </PERSON>, who was working off-duty security at the fair, overheard the shot, chased several people through the midway crowd and found police Sgt. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>, a gunman, and another man struggling on the ground, <PERSON> Holt </PERSON> said. He said the gunman pointed a pistol at <LOCATION> Dailey </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dailey </PERSON> fired, the man returned fire, and the officer shot a second time, <PERSON> Holt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON> was shot in the hand and the man who police said shot <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON> died of multiple gunshot wounds. In addition to the gunman and the police sergeant, two other men were shot, one near the restroom and one on the midway, <PERSON> Holt </PERSON> said. A witness to the shooting said <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON> saved his life. `` If it had n't been for that cop, I would have got shot. He got ahold of his -LRB- the gunman's -RRB- hand,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said. He and his family were leaving the fair when the shooting broke out and the combatants fell on top of <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>'s pregnant daughter. She was one of eight pregnant women treated at Parkland and <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> hospitals for injuries or premature labor caused by the fair-goers' stampede. Six were released and none gave birth, hospital officials said. Information after the remaining two was unavailable. <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> officials said they treated five other people trampled or bruised in the crush after the shooting. When Boy, the officer who had made an arrest, and other officers realized an officer had been shot, they began moving through the panicked crowd to help him. `` It was pretty scary. They were all coming at us and you did n't know who had a gun,'' said <PERSON> Boy </PERSON>, 42, who has been a police officer for 10 years The wounded sergeant was in stable condition Saturday following surgery at <LOCATION> Baylor </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> medical examiner's office identified the dead man as <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabors </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Federal authorities investigating the crash of a small plane near <LOCATION> Frederick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, were looking Saturday into whether the crash might be connected with the landing at about the same time of a jet carrying President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The wreckage of a single engine <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> Arrow that crashed Friday evening was found in mountainous terrain west of <LOCATION> Frederick </LOCATION> shortly after dawn Saturday. The pilot, identified as <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Spring </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, was killed. According to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, preliminary information from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> indicates the <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> crashed about 20 minutes after the landing at <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> of a small <ORGANIZATION> Gulfstream </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> II </ORGANIZATION> jet carrying the president. The president and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, were bound for the presidential retreat at Camp <PERSON> David </PERSON> and flew into nearby Frederick airport because rain and fog prevented them from taking a helicopter directly to the retreat. There was speculation that the arrival of the president's plane might have caused the smaller plane to be ordered into a holding pattern until <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s plane landed. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>, said he had no preliminary information that the <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> was ordered to hold off its landing, but he said air traffic communications with the plane would be reviewed as part of the investigation. `` We still have to check the information out,'' <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> said. Maj. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayres </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> wing of the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> had two to three hours of fuel left in its tanks when it crashed. White House spokeswoman <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said the president's plane landed at <LOCATION> Frederick </LOCATION> at 5:32 p.m. Friday. <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> said preliminary information from the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> showed that the <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> was given clearance to land at 5:38 p.m. but that the plane disappeared from radar at 5:53 p.m.

 The 535 men and women who made up the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had a very good two years or a very bad two years, depending on your point of view.

 Throughout the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, Democrats struggled to pass a campaign spending limitations bill over Republican opposition. In the end they failed. But the battle will be remembered. At 1:30 a.m. one day last March, Republicans fled the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor to prevent a quorum from being established and to force the Democratic leadership to adjourn. A call went out for the sergeant-at-arms to arrest absent senators. Sergeant-at-Arms <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Giugni </PERSON> used a master key to enter the private office of Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore. <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> was arrested and escorted to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chamber But he refused to enter. <PERSON> Giugni </PERSON> ordered a squad of detectives to lift <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> from his feet and to carry him inside. They did so and his presence gave the Democrats a quorum and the Republicans a severe case of outrage. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> remained in session all night.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> worried about its `` quality of life.'' Younger senators, especially those with children, grumbled about legislative chaos, sessions that stretched deep into the night, roll calls that stretched far beyond their allotted 15 minutes, a `` Tuesday-Thursday Club'' that saw senators stretch a two-day weekend into four. Action was taken. In exchange for time off every fourth week, senators were expected to be present Monday through Friday for the rest of the month. Roll calls were restricted to 15 minutes with no waiting for senators who did not show up on time. Almost immediately the law of unintended consequences went into effect. With the 15-minute clock running, a band of senators piled off elevators in the subway lobby of the <ORGANIZATION> Hart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> building. The roofless, three-car train was waiting. But it was filled with visitors who happened to be blind. It took a while for the senators to get possession of the train. Fuming, they stormed onto the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor minutes after the roll call ended, only to be told that they could not vote and would not be recorded. Now, during roll calls, the trains are reserved for the exclusive transportation of senators.

 One of three trapped whales was presumed dead Saturday, but its companions inched toward open water as <ORGANIZATION> Eskimos </ORGANIZATION> cut a string of breathing holes and a helicopter battering ram smashed a path through thick ice. `` They certainly have a very good fighting chance in their battle to escape,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Withrow </PERSON>, a federal marine mammal biologist, said Saturday. However, a huge ridge formed by colliding ice masses stood in the way of a breakthrough for the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whales, members of an endangered species. The big marine mammals were about four miles from open water. A second ice-smashing Skycrane cargo helicopter was standing by two hours away in <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> in case rescuers decided a second concrete ice-bashing `` bullet'' was needed. And at <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> direction, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> assigned the largest aircraft in its inventory _ the C-5A Galaxy _ to ferry more equipment from <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Barrow </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> said Saturday. The whale nicknamed Bone disappeared beneath the foot-thick ice Friday afternoon. By midnight Friday, rescuers on the ice near this small Eskimo town on the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> had given up hope Bone might rejoin the others. North Slope Borough biologist <PERSON> Geoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said the whale was presumed dead. `` Everyone is sorry to hear about the whale, but I do n't think it was totally unexpected,'' <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said Saturday. He had told reporters earlier the whale was the weakest of the three, and had some respiratory problems. Bone, <PERSON> Crossbeak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bonnet </PERSON> became trapped at a small breathing hole in unseasonably heavy ice more than two weeks ago during their annual migration south. Open water was too far away for them to reach it without surfacing to breathe. The missing whale got its name because skin on its snout had been rubbed to the bone by the rough ice surrounding the breathing hole. That condition may have led to <PERSON> Bone </PERSON>'s death, said biologist <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>. `` Once they get a bone infection, they go pretty quick,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> said. The whale's body probably sank to the bottom but may float in a few days because of gases from decomposition, <PERSON> George </PERSON> said. `` We'll either find it or a -LRB- polar -RRB- bear will,'' he said Polar bears feed on whale carcasses. Something will have to be done about the ice ridge, and soon, if the remaining whales are to be freed, said Col. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s two Skycrane helicopters on loan for the rescue. `` We looked for an alternate route -LRB- bypassing the ridge -RRB- and did n't find it,'' he said. `` If there's no way through it, it will have to be tackled early while the whales still are some ways from it.'' The ridge lies about a quarter-mile from an area of open water leading to the open sea. The ridge was believed to be too thick to be punctured by the helicopters' five-ton, steel-reinforced concrete hammers, and local ice specialists were assessing the situation Saturday, said <PERSON> Geoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>. `` I think we're going to blast,'' he said. Bone disappeared about the same time rescuers had their greatest success. About two dozen Eskimo volunteers, many of them bowhead whale hunters, led the whales almost a half-mile closer to open water Friday by using chain saws to carve a string of 10-by-30-foot breathing holes. They continued carving holes on Saturday. De-icers, which keep the holes open by agitating the water, freed the Eskimos to work on new holes. `` After waiting so long for high tech equipment, it's the local people who have kind of taken over and made some progress,'' <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said. The whales, meanwhile, were swimming from hole to hole, apparently responding to efforts to lead them to open water, biologists said. `` Their swimming patterns now are about what you'd expect them to be,'' said <PERSON> Withrow </PERSON>, who is from <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. Biologists removed a de-icing machine from the whales' original hole late Friday and started one of the machines in the most distant new hole. They also shined a bright light in the farthest hole. In a matter of minutes, the whales popped up in that hole, touching off a chorus of cheers from people on the ice. Rescuers shoveled snow and ice into the original hole Friday evening in an effort to seal it and discourage the whales from returning. But late Friday, they did just that, nosing up through the slush. `` That's OK,'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said. `` It's just a little retrogression. We're in good shape.'' The first huge CH-54 Skycrane helicopter loaned by the Guard worked in the opposite direction from the Eskimo crews, working from the open water back toward the whales, so as not to frighten the mammals. The aircraft, designed to haul heavy cargo, used a concrete block suspended from its cargo hook to punch four 15 - to 20-foot holes in the ice at 75-yard intervals `` They hover the helicopter 20 feet over the ice, and drop the ` bullet,''' said Spec. 4 <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, a Guard spokesman. `` It drops through the ice on the second or third try. Then they pull it back out.'' The second Skycrane abandoned the repeatedly frustrated effort to drag a 185-ton, icebreaking `` hover-barge'' 230 miles from the oil fields at <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. The population of endangered <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whales has risen to about 20,000, growing at an annual average of 2.5 percent for the past decade, officials said. The whales spend their winters in the warm water off <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and summer in the food-rich northern seas

<DATELINE>BLACKFOOT, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A boxcar filled with radioactive waste was headed back to the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> on Saturday, three days after Gov. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> banned the temporary storage in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> of any new shipments. The boxcar full of low-level nuclear waste had been in limbo at a rail yard in the eastern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Blackfoot </LOCATION>, the last stop before a temporary waste storage facility at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> about 35 miles northwest of here. It originated at the <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>'s Rocky Flats facility, 16 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, but was stopped after <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> issued an order Wednesday banning the storage of additional waste at the lab. `` The boxcar will return to <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> and we'll probably just leave it on our siding until we get permission to ship it someplace else,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogard </PERSON>, shift superintendent at Rocky Flats. The boxcar left Blackfoot mid-afternoon Saturday. An <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> officer and a <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> railroad agent had kept an eye on the boxcar while it was in <LOCATION> Blackfoot </LOCATION>. It had been inspected for safety by an environmental engineer from the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>. Lab spokeswoman <PERSON> Penny </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON> said the decision was made late Friday by <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Primarily, the decision was made to kind of clear the air and remove what we considered a contentious item,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON> said. The move was delayed by the need to examine the potential impact of returning the waste to Rocky Flats, she said. `` It's not as easy as turning your car around and driving back.'' <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> issued the order in an effort to force the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to open the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near <LOCATION> Carlsbad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, the nation's first permanent repository for defense-generated, low-level nuclear waste. More than 2 million cubic feet of low-level radioactive waste already is stored above ground at the <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> lab, awaiting transfer to a permanent dump like the one in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, which was supposed to open this month, but has been postponed until at least January. `` They have broken their word too many times,'' said <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON>, who traveled to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> site last week. `` They can not give us a date.'' `` Hopefully the opening of the WIPP facility will be the final solution,'' Rocky Flats' <PERSON> Bogard </PERSON> said Saturday. `` We have about 90 days capacity and space on the plant site that's available where we could safely store it.'' The opening of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> site was pushed back after <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> engineers raised questions about the safety of the proposed repository. There have also been delays in certifying the casks that will carry the waste to the site. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Garrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Carruthers </PERSON> said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> communities will object to opening the site until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> provides money for road bypasses and improvements on the route to the site. The <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> governor won an assurance from <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Ofte </PERSON>, manager of the <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> laboratory, on Friday that the DOE will voluntarily abide by his ban on all further shipment of waste into <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. The bulk of the waste at the lab, built up over two decades, has come from the Rocky Flats plant. Other facilities also have been ordered to stop shipping waste to the lab. <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> said a westbound truckload of waste from the <ORGANIZATION> Argonne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> was turned back at <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, after federal officials were notified it would be intercepted by state police at the <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> border. Meanwhile, an Oct. 19 letter from Sen. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>, D-Colo., to Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> indicated the DOE began assessing the storage situation only after <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> blockaded <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>, in his letter to <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>, again pressed for a list of contingency plans to cope with the <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> ban, declaring that in his state `` the situation has changed from urgent to critical.'' <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> said Deputy Energy Secretary <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON> had notified him Wednesday afternoon, shortly after <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> imposed the ban, that `` he was pulling together an internal <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> working group to assess'' the governor's action.

 Thousands of Nicaraguans, unfamiliar with hurricanes and jaded by repeated warnings of possible <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasions, refused to flee Hurricane <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>'s deadly path Saturday. The hurricane, with 125 mph winds, destroyed about 90 percent of the buildings in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Bluefields </LOCATION> and slashed through the <LOCATION> Corn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> off the Nicaraguan coast. The two areas have a population of about 68,000. Although thousands were evacuated, thousands of others remained in their homes despite warnings, President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said in a speech broadcast on radio and television. Initial reports said 15 Nicaraguans were killed Saturday and the overall death toll from the storm that began ravaging the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and Central American coasts last Monday was at least 65 in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. The hurricane weakened to a tropical storm, but torrential rains continued and Nicaraguan officials said they would order forced evacuations if need be as the storm struck <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, 180 miles west of <LOCATION> Bluefields </LOCATION>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON>, director of civil defense, angrily called for people to go to shelters. `` Sandinista police and the EPS -LRB- the army -RRB- have orders to evacuate by force if necessary,'' <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON> said on television. Some who refused to evacuate low-lying ground said they did n't believe the government, which has on numerous occasions called on the people to mobilize against a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion `` The people were tired of these calls. They do n't believe them,'' said <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, who refused to evacuate his home in the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Torres </LOCATION> neighborhood on the edge of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. `` The government has told us so many lies that we just do n't believe them any more,'' said a <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> woman who spoke with the condition she not be identified Others said people did n't realize what damage a hurricane could inflict _ the last hurricane to strike <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> was in 1911. Government radio repeatedly issued storm warnings. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said during his address that he had visited <LOCATION> Bluefields </LOCATION> on Friday and urged people to leave. `` I told the people to leave their homes because it is easier to rebuild your home than to reconstruct your life,'' he said. Only a few thousand people left <LOCATION> Bluefields </LOCATION> in a government evacuation program Friday, although others fled coastal zones. Authorities feared <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>'s heavy rains could cause more flooding, especially in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, which is relatively flat and poorly drained. Thousands of refugees from the seven-year civil war with the U.S.-supported rebels known as Contras have moved into <LOCATION> Managuya </LOCATION>, swelling its population to 1 million. Many live in wooden shacks beside dirt fields. Civil defense committees piled sand bags in front of many buildings, cut tree limbs that might be blown down and cleared drainage ditches. Windows of the eight-story Hotel Intercontinental were taped over.

 Polls are illuminating an electorate in turmoil, with voters still groping _ some of them dispiritedly _ toward a decision in the presidential election, analysts say. While surveys indicate a healthy <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lead, striking differences in gauging the size of the lead underline a certain unhappiness with the choices, some pollsters said in recent days. And that means things still can change with just over two weeks to go, they said. `` People are having lots of second thoughts,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohut </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Gallup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Even in polls that have found stable results for weeks, he said, `` I term it stable uncertainty.'' Several pollsters _ but not all _ agreed with such an analysis: That a good number of voters, even at this late date, remain loosely committed to either <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or to Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, and could change their minds. `` I see more indecision than usual, and I ascribe that a lot to the negativism of the campaign,'' said I.A. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, chief of polling for the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think there's a kind of reluctance for people to commit themselves to one of two people, neither of whom they like.'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, in the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll, has found that four in 10 of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' supporters and nearly three in 10 of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s oppose the other candidate more than they favor their own _ hardly an inspiring reason to cast a vote Gallup has found less than half of each candidate's supporters backing him strongly, and a sizable share, roughly three in 10, saying they could change their minds. And in an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll, 57 percent of likely voters wished they had a different set of choices. `` Neither of these guys seems to attract the kind of commitment that some other presidential candidates have had,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugick </PERSON>, political pollster for Gallup. Even though Gallup has found a stable <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lead since August, he said, `` If you look at the depth of commitment, you'll see there's still potential for change.'' The view of a still-volatile electorate was not unanimous. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON>, pollster for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, saw a more stable contest. His surveys, like <PERSON> Gallup </PERSON>'s bi-weekly ones, have found a steady lead for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and he has found considerably stronger support for the candidates than Gallup has. `` My polling does n't show very much volatility at all,'' said <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON>, who has polled every night since Labor Day. `` There's a clear indication of a very stable race.'' But not all polls are in line with each other. An <ORGANIZATION> NBC-Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll, taken Friday through Sunday last weekend, found an enormous 17-point <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lead. A Harris poll Friday to Monday the same weekend put it down to nine points. And an <ORGANIZATION> ABC-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll from the previous Wednesday to Tuesday put it at seven, roughly where it's been for weeks. Most recently, a <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> poll of 1,013 registered voters conducted by telephone on Thursday and Friday showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 50 percent to 41 percent, with a margin of error of 4 percentage points. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> pollster <PERSON> Laurily </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON> said her poll could have caught a swing to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> after the presidential debate last week, then missed some shifting back to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Monday. She noted that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> received wide publicity as the debate winner. Other pollsters shared her view, noting that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> surged after the Democratic convention last summer and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> after the Republican convention, but settled back as the publicity wore off. Their hypothesis: When voters do n't have strong opinions, they are more likely to be influenced by events, albeit momentarily. `` Polling immediately after momentous events catches people in the process of making up their minds. What you see are these distortions,'' said <PERSON> Kohut </PERSON>, the Gallup president. He likened it to a runner's pulse after a race: `` It's an accurate reading. But you ca n't generalize a lot from it.'' <PERSON> Kohut </PERSON> and others said such skittishness in the electorate magnifies the methodological differences in polls _ whether or not they urge undecided voters to make a choice, for example _ and can help skew results.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> defended his record on crime Saturday in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, where his prospects have been hurt by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s allegations on the subject. Later, in a taped speech on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>, the Democratic presidential candidate accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of waging a campaign `` of fear and of smear.'' At sunup Saturday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spoke at a crowded pipefitters union hall in <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION>, accompanied by his running mate, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. He capped the day by speaking back-to-back with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> before the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Italian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Many of you know the vice president's been going to a lot of ethnic festivals lately,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told the Italian group. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON>, it would have saved you a lot of time if you'd just picked <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> to be your running mate.'' <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, a Republican senator from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, is the son of <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> immigrants. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who delivered part of his address in Italian, repeated many of the same self-deprecating jokes that he delivered at the <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> dinner in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> two days earlier. On a serious note, he told the group: `` The immigrants' dream is the American dream. It is now in our hands. We must never forget that dream belongs not just to the privileged few but to all of us.'' Earlier, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Hawkinsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, for a barbecue rally with top <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Democrats in what was to be a show of solidarity in a major Southern state where the campaign has been in trouble. Before some 4,000 people at a rally in a high school football field in rural <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was joined by former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and the state's top elected Democrats. `` People say there's not a very good chance that we'll have a governor from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. `` But I think that we and you and <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> can turn it around.'' Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> denounced <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign as one of `` distortions and in many cases outright and total lies.'' Attacking <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s use of the case of furloughed inmate <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, who attacked a family while released from a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prison, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> described in graphic detail the rape and murder of a pregnant young mother by an inmate furloughed from a federal prison under President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ and said it was <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> who signed into law the federal furlough program. `` A governor and a president can not prevent all the horrible crimes we have today, even though it's on his watch,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. `` A presidential candidate, though, can be expected to tell the truth and put it in perspective. And Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has a duty to do that.'' The case of <PERSON> Patsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pedrin </PERSON> is one <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is usuing in new television ads and which he spoke about earlier <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> _ while saying he would `` never use that kind of human tragedy'' for political purposes. In both <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, where he campaigned Saturday, and in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> where he was Friday night, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> trails <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in polls by as much as 10 points. In his <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> speech, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> recounted the crimes of a prisoner released on furlough from a federal prison while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was vice president. `` I would never use that kind of human tragedy to accuse the president of being soft on crime,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Maybe that's the difference beteen me and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. In his television speech, which was set for 10:55 p.m. EDT on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spoke of the beating and robbing of his father and the hit-and-run death of his brother as examples of how `` my family has been touched by violence.'' `` I've led the fight against crime and drugs in my own state and I intend to do so as president,'' he said. Before the rally with state party leaders in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said, `` With this kind of show of support, it sends a signal to the people of this state that we're comfortable with our nominee.''

<HEAD>Hodel Proposes Cutting 2,000 Positions from Department</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Interior Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> has proposed cutting 2,000 jobs in his 69,000-employee department, starting a year from now, according to a report in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>' Sunday editions. An internal memorandum disclosed that <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> proposed turning many of those jobs over to private contractors, according to the newspaper, which said it obtained the memo from sources outside the government. More than 500 of the proposed cuts would be made in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the Times said. The proposal calls for a study of the feasibility of turning over to the private sector such jobs as orientation services for park visitors and park maintenance. The proposal also suggests turning the map-making function of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION> over to private enterprise, the Times said. The memo was written by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ventura </PERSON>, the assistant <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> secretary for policy, budget and administration. A department spokesman, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>, said a second memorandum stressed that no employees would be forced to retire. He said normal attrition in the department was higher than the number of proposed cuts.

<HEAD>Demonstrators Angry over `Sleazy, Cheap' TV Drama</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An AIDS support organization Saturday called an <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> series sleazy for an episode depicting the fictitious murder of a bisexual man who knowingly infects sexual partners with the deadly virus. `` NBC should not exploit the human tragedy of the AIDS epidemic to increase rating points and profits,'' said <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfred </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. Fearing the episode would unleash violence against carriers of the virus, 60 demonstrators earlier this week shut down the shooting on an outdoor scene of `` Midnight Caller,'' an action drama series set in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The first episode is scheduled to air Tuesday night. The protests, set to resume Monday when <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> productions resumes shooting, began after negotiations between several AIDS groups, the show's producers, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> officials and representatives of the mayor's office failed to reach an agreement on changes in the script. `` We are not asking <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and the producers to cancel a ` Midnight Caller' episode on AIDS,'' <PERSON> Wolfred </PERSON> said in a statement Saturday. `` We would wholeheartedly support an episode that promotes understanding of HIV disease.'' A handout distributed with the statement called the disputed episode, which will be shown sometime in the future, `` sleazy ... sensational ... cheap television drama.'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said it has agreed to talk more with demonstrators next week but insisted shooting will resume on Monday. In the episode in question, a bisexual man carrying the AIDS virus purposely infects others by having sexual relations with them. One of the partners, a woman who discovers she carries the AIDS virus, shoots and kills the man at the end of the episode. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, executive producer of the program, said he decided to leave the murder in the script but that he asked for revisions to reflect demonstrators' concerns. `` The hero says that the murder is absolutely the wrong solution,'' said Singer. `` No one watching it could think we were condoning this by any stretch of the imagination.''

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> pressed his counterattack against front-runner <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Saturday, blaming a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign `` of fear and of smear'' for distorting his image to voters. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> disavowed <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> GOP ads asserting rapists and murderers vote for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The two presidential candidates later capped their campaign days by making back-to-back appearances before a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Italian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> banquet in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, sharing a dais for the second time in three days. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> repeated many of the same self-deprecating jokes he had delivered when he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> addressed the <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> dinner in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> earlier in the week, but on a more serious note, told the Italian group: `` The immigrants' dream is the American dream. It is now in our hands. We must never forget that dream belongs not just to the privileged few but to all of us.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> maintained a serious tone throughout his remarks, recalling his emotions when he has witnessed immigrants take the oath of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship. `` I saw their tears of joy and felt their appreciation of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the crowd. `` We share that joy tonight ... and we resolve together as Americans to preserve and protect and, indeed, extend it in the years ahead.'' In a taped-for-television speech, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> touched on criticism of his campaign style in a race in which all polls show him trailing. `` I may not wear my heart on my sleeve,'' he said, but he promised that in the remaining two weeks he would `` fight my heart out for the things I believe in.'' His remarks came in a five-minute speech his campaign paid to air on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> at 10:55 p.m. EDT. Earlier, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and running mate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> campaigned in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> joined state party officials in a show of solidarity in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> _ two Southern states where polls suggest <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has made headway by portraying the Democrat as soft on crime. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> took the issue on in his speech, saying simply: `` In their TV ads, the Republicans accuse me of being soft on criminals. That's a lie.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a brief appearance at his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> home, dissociated himself from one printed ad along that line. He was asked about brochures distributed by the state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> with a headline saying, `` All the Murderers and Rapists and Drug Pushers and Child Molesters in <LOCATION> Masschusetts </LOCATION> Vote For <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' Asked if he approved, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` No I do n't, and I do n't back some of the stuff they're saying about me. ... No I disapprove of that.'' He did n't say what he objected to on the Democratic side. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was questioned after he met privately with former Cuban prisoner <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Valladares </PERSON>, who was freed after 22 years in 1982. On another matter, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked to comment on the racketeering indictment of former <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. `` That speaks for itself, and let the justice system go forward; that's what I say,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who was out of the public eye Saturday, said in an interview Friday night that the two campaigns' concentration on producing 15-second `` sound bites'' for evening news shows was n't so bad because `` one-liners say a lot. `` The information is out there'' for voters to make their decisions, he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' televised speech was part of a concerted effort by the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign to reach a wider audience. He also is airing a tough new set of commercials accusing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of distortions and lies and is planning a number of other television appearances, including an interview Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> show, `` Nightline.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has repeatedly criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for a former <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prisoner-furlough program under which an inmate failed to return after a weekend pass and later attacked a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> couple. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in a speech Saturday in <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, recounted the crimes of a prisoner who raped and murdered a pregnant young mother after being released on furlough from a federal prison. `` I would never use that kind of human tragedy to accuse the president of being soft on crime,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Maybe that's the difference between me and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. National polls show <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by margins ranging from seven to 17 points. And state polls show <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> trailing in such key states as <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> that are critical to his hopes for victory on Nov. 8. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in the taped TV speech that he enters the final two weeks of the campaign an underdog and that `` some of you do n't know much more about me than a name and a set of labels.'' `` Part of the fault may rest with our own effort,'' he said. `` But I think it is also fair to say that the other side has pursued a campaign of distortion and distraction _ of fear and of smear.'' He cited <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign ads attacking him for the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prison furlough program and for pollution in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. `` Are you satisifed with what you are hearing this year?'' he asked. `` Do you think this is the way to pick the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>?'' `` It is n't easy for the truth to catch up with the lies,'' he said. `` And to clear up the fog of deception that has been spread across the campaign. `` But I am determined to fight this fight.'' `` I may not wear my heart on my sleeve, but I hope tonight you have some sense of what is in my heart. And in the remaining days of this campaign, I intend to fight my heart out for the things that I believe in.'' Responding to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ads on crime, he mentioned the beating and robbing of his father and the hit-and-run death of his brother as examples of how `` my family has been touched by violence.'' `` I've led the fight against crime and drugs in my own state and I intend to do so as president,'' he said. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in his weekly radio address, derided <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign slogan of `` good jobs at good wages,'' contending it amounts to a slur against such hard-working Americans as `` short-order chefs. In the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> response, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> said, `` We need a president who has a plan for making the trade deficit a trade surplus, who is willing to make a real commitment to ending the policy of borrow and debt that has put us into a sea of red ink.''

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Saturday he does not approve of campaign literature that Republicans in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> distributed saying Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is supported by rapists, murderers and other criminals. `` No I do n't and I do n't back some of the stuff they're saying about me. ... No I disapprove of that,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, without elaborating on what in particular he was taking exception to on the Democratic side. He made the statement in answer to a question following a meeting Saturday with former Cuban political prisoner <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Valladares </PERSON>, who was freed after 22 years in 1982. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called the Cuban, who wrote the book `` Against All Hope,'' an `` inspiration to all who are for human rights.'' At a banquet Saturday night sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Italian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> shared a dais for the second time in three days. They shook hands briefly and both applauded politely as the other was introduced. Before the dinner, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met briefly with former Italian Prime Minister <PERSON> Bettino </PERSON> <PERSON> Craxi </PERSON>. In brief remarks, the vice president recalled his emotions when he has witnessed immigrants take the oath of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship. `` I saw their tears of joy and felt their appreciation of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the crowd of 3,000 attending the dinner. `` We share that joy tonight ... and we resolve together as Americans to preserve and protect and, indeed, extend it in the years ahead.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign also announced the formation of Catholics for <ORGANIZATION> Bush-Quayle </ORGANIZATION>'88, to be headed by former <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., and conservative activist <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlafly </PERSON> In general, the vice president was spending a quiet weekend mostly out of the campaign spotlight. He planned to head to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> on Monday, then begin an extended campaign trip across the country. On another matter raised by questioners outside his residence Saturday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> responded briefly when asked for a comment on the racketeering indictment of former <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. `` That speaks for itself, and let the justice system go forward; that's what I say,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The indictment returned Friday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> alleges <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> defrauded three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lending institutions of $ 165 million in order to buy and finance real estate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and amassed $ 103 million through embezzlement, bribes and kickbacks then laundered the money through secret bank accounts. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said little about the presidential campaign except in answer to a question about the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> brochures. Distributed by the state party, they bore the headline, `` All the Murderers and Rapists and Drug Pushers and Child Molesters in <LOCATION> Masschusetts </LOCATION> Vote For <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has consistently sought to portray <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as soft on crime, citing in particular <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' former prisoner-furlough program. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held up the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> brochures in campaign appearances Wednesday and called them `` political garbage.''

 In what may have been his final remarks on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor, Democrat <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stennis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> said Friday that in `` thinking over the years that have passed so rapidly'' he's concluded the most needed quality in a lawmaker is the willingness to cooperate The end of the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> marks the end of <PERSON> Stennis </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> career, dating to 1947.

<TEXT>
 The Chamber of Deputies is investigating charges by the oilworkers union that the governor of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> state embezzled $ 49 million from the government petroleum monopoly <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> when he headed it. Seven deputies from the governing <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>, made the accusation against Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Beteta </PERSON> Thursday night. As <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> deputy <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrientos </PERSON>, head of a local union, spoke, oilworkers crowded into the chamber's public galleries shouted: `` To the gallows, to jail'' and `` He robbed the nation,'' the financial daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financiero </ORGANIZATION> said. The speaker of the chamber named a 22-member commission to investigate the charges. The investigation was approved by deputies from both the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> majority and opposition parties. <PERSON> Beteta </PERSON>, an economist and former treasury secretary, left <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> in January when he his took office as governor of the state of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. He was named head of <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> by President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON> as part of his `` moral renewal'' campaign against corruption. He replaced <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON>, whose conviction for embezzling $ 58.7 million from <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> in a 1980 oil tanker deal was a showcase of the campaign. During his five years as <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> chief, <PERSON> Beteta </PERSON> clashed repeatedly with the union. <PERSON> Barrientos </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Beteta </PERSON> of defrauding <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> of $ 49 million through a 1985 deal for two Yugoslav-built tankers, and said the union had documents to back up its allegations. He said the deal involved a company called <ORGANIZATION> Flota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petrolera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexicana </ORGANIZATION>, which bought a pair of Yugoslav-built tankers with only $ 2.5 million in capital, then leased them to <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> for a profit of $ 49 million. <PERSON> Barrientos </PERSON> also accused the former commercial director of <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Donasiano </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamez </PERSON>; a <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> senator from the state of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Alcantara </PERSON> <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON>; and the president of <ORGANIZATION> Flota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petrolera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexicana </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Isidoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, of being involved in the deal.

 The multibillion-dollar takeover deals surfacing almost every day make it clear that practically any company, no matter how large, can now be bought with borrowed money. But this craze of debt-financed buyouts and other types of restructuring, while often rewarding stockholders with windfall profits, also raise a number of troubling questions, such as where is all the money coming from, how will it affect the economy, and what happens if the money can not be repaid. Many critics believe the stupendous movement of money and rapidly rising debt loads associated with these transactions reflect nearsighted values that continue to grip corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and Wall Street _ despite the lessons of speculative excesses learned from the stock crash a year ago. Critics also blame the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> era of deregulation, lax enforcement of antitrust laws and to some extent the stock crash itself, which cut the price of many publicly held companies and made them attractive targets. All of these elements have lured staggering sums of investor cash, from pension managers to foreign banks, into the hands of dealmaking strategists who promise a quick return. `` Money, the ability to get money when you need it, in these huge amounts, is critical to all that's happening,'' said <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudie </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrigan </PERSON>, professor of strategic management at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. More conservative use of this money, she said, `` does n't look attractive when you're in a short-term world. We ca n't wait that long. We've got to have instant pudding.'' By some estimates, the amount of money available to finance leveraged buyouts or LBOs _ in which a buyer borrows to acquire a company and repays the debt with the company's earnings, cash flow or assets _ totaled less than $ 100 million in 1980. Now it totals at least $ 250 billion. Contrary to popular belief, most of this money does not come from the fortunes of the rich. Much of it comes, indirectly, from the pension funds of millions of American workers and retirees. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> statistics show that the assets in these funds alone totaled nearly $ 2 trillion last year. The money also comes from foreign lenders, notably Japanese banks, the world's richest. Even some of the most conservative <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks and Wall Street firms, which once shied away from LBOs as laden with uncertainty, are now joining in with hundreds of millions in their own capital. `` It's really staggering, the amount of money out there that can be focused in any area,'' said <PERSON> Chriss </PERSON> <PERSON> Street </PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Seidler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amdec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> investment firm. `` I think it's a sign of greed more than anything,'' he said. `` Money always tends to drive in the rear-view mirror, it follows track records. Right now the track records of people involved in LBOs are staggering.'' Dealmaking firms that specialize in LBOs, such as <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, have enjoyed spectacular success, giving their own investors and clients returns of 30 percent or more a year. Compare that with 12.5 percent so far this year in the stock market, roughly 8 percent for a 1-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill, 7.5 percent in a money market mutual fund and less in a standard savings account. <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> completed the biggest LBO on record two years ago, a $ 6.1 billion deal that took food conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> private. But the definition of how big an LBO can get was rewritten this past week, when the management of tobacco-food giant <ORGANIZATION> RJR-Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> said it was considering a $ 17 billion LBO, which would be the biggest corporate takeover ever. This gargantuan proposal came only three days after <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> launched an $ 11.4 billion takeover bid for <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and only a few weeks after British conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> offered $ 5.2 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The common message in these undertakings, many securities professionals said, was that any company can be a takeover target. `` They once said that just because <LOCATION> Everest </LOCATION> was n't climbed does n't mean it could n't be,'' Street said. `` My gut feeling is you've got probably a couple of years before the real megadeals will come to the fore.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaLoggia </PERSON>, editor of Special Situations Report, a respected market newsletter based in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said `` I'll bet by the end of the year, something happens that even dwarfs this RJR deal. By far, the biggest worry about this frenzy of dealmaking is its effect on the economy. Aside from the upheaval on millions of affected workers and managers, there is an increasing fear that LBO-restructured companies have too much debt and could default if interest rates rise even slightly. `` If our current economic picture should change _ if we should go into a recession _ the consequences for these LBOs are not good,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Horne </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> professor, wrote in a recent edition of the school's magazine. `` They are financed with 90 percent debt or more, allowing almost no margin of error or cushion.'' The concern has been heightened recently because these debt-financed takeovers are growing at the waning stages of an economic recovery cycle that is now nearly 6 years old. `` When you want to be leveraged the most is when you're bottoming out and on the way up,'' said <PERSON> LaLoggia </PERSON>, who predicts the relentless pace of LBOs could lead to another financial crisis like the crash last year `` I do n't see where bankers or businessmen, no matter how sophisticated they are, are less susceptible to the herd instinct,'' he said. `` They're going to have to pay the piper. A year or two down the line, in hindsight, it's going to be incredible how bad their judgment was.''

<HEAD>Buyout Wave Rocks Corporate Bond Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The latest outbreak of buyout fever on Wall Street has unsettled the corporate bond market, and analysts say it may prompt more corporate borrowers to offer some buyer protection when selling new bonds. In the past week, two of the biggest buyouts in history have been suggested. <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> proposed an $ 11.4 billion takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said its management is considering taking the company private in a $ 17.6 billion deal. That kind of talk is bad news for those holding a buyer's bonds because chances are the buyer will take on a lot more debt to accomplish the deal. Suddenly the company that looked so solid when it sold the bonds that individual and institutional investors now hold in their portfolios does n't look like such a great credit risk anymore. News of the latest potential buyouts sent prices reeling and yields higher on billions of dollars in debt from <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>. Dealers said the price of long bonds from <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>, for instance, tumbled about 14 points, or $ 140 for every $ 1,000 in face value, after word of the possible buyout reached the market. As prices of its bonds fell, their yields rocketed nearly two percentage points to about 11.9 percent. But the announcements had a broader impact, putting downward pressure on corporate bond prices generally as speculation flared about which other companies could be next, analysts said. That's a big difference between this and earlier buyout waves, said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Morse </PERSON>, senior vice president in charge of corporate and government bond trading at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Morse </PERSON> said recent buyouts of a number of retailing firms mainly affected only the bond prices of the companies involved `` The opinion going into 1988 was that there are some companies that are just too big to be put into play and their debt securities were safe from event risk, the event being a takeover or leveraged buyout,'' he said. But he said the latest buyout wave has `` substantially destroyed this article of faith.'' As a result, he said this past week's developments made some investors wonder about the chances that the companies whose bonds they hold may become involved in a similar situation, either as aggressor or target. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ednie </PERSON>, corporate vice president and senior industrial bond trader at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said another reason for the decline in corporate bond prices is that some big investors such as pension funds are required to invest only in securities carrying the higher credit ratings. When it appears a company may face a ratings downgrade, he said these bondholders often scramble to sell those securities and reinvest in higher-grade issues such as <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> or utility bonds. `` One of the most common realities in leveraged buyouts is that they tend to turn double-A and single-A credits into new credits of less than investment grade,'' <PERSON> Ednie </PERSON> said. The two major debt ratings agencies, <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said that they were monitoring <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> and RJR to see if a reduction in rating is warranted. Dean <PERSON> Witter </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Morse </PERSON> said one likely impact of merger mania will be that those who buy bonds will demand greater assurance from the issuer that they will be able to sell their bonds for a fair price if the issuer later decides for whatever reason to load up on more debt. <PERSON> Morse </PERSON> said some companies have attached so-called poison-put options to their bond issues, giving bondholders the right to sell the bonds back to the issuer at specified terms if the issuer becomes involved in a buyout. Corporate managements generally do n't like such provisions because it limits their ability to make moves without incurring a sizeable liability to buy back outstanding debt. But <PERSON> Morse </PERSON> said since the notion that some deals are too big to be done has been called into question, companies may find they must offer some protection to find ready buyers for their debt.

 The takeover-buyout mania now sweeping through corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has some Wall Streeters applauding and others shaking their heads. The fans of these multibillion-dollar deals say they are powerful medicine for a stock market still struggling to recover from the crash of 1987. In the absence of buying by individuals and many institutional money managers, they ask, where would the stock market be today without the leveraged-buyout specialists and the traders, known as arbitragers, who follow in their wake? What's more, they say, takeovers and buyouts are a long-term plus for the market because they reduce the supply of stock in the marketplace, giving an upward bias to the prices of the shares that remain available. But more skeptical observers, while acknowledging some of those points, argue that all this wheeling and dealing is contributing huge new amounts to an already dangerous accumulation of debt in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. And the activity it generates in the market, they say, represents unhealthy speculation rather than stable, long-term investment. The mergers and acquisitions binge is nothing new, of course. Takeovers and buyouts were a dominant force in the 1982-87 bull market. A similar phenomenon occurred in the 1960s, when conglomerate-building was the financial rage. Lately, however, the game has been played on an expanded scale. In the past week alone, <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> proposed an $ 11.4 billion offer for <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabsico </ORGANIZATION> said it was considering a $ 17.6 billion management buyout plan. If such deals can be done, analysts say, there appears to be virtually no limit to what might be attempted in the future, no company too big to be ruled out as a takeover or buyout candidate. That prospect helped propel stock prices higher in the past week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 50.32 to 2,183.50, hitting its highest levels since the crash of'87 as the first anniversary of that debacle passed. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index gained 3.96 to 159.42; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market added 4.00 to 388.59, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index was up 3.52 at 306.07. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 170.63 million shares a day, up from 147.05 million the week before. `` The short-term rewards to selling shareholders in the form of capital gains are indisputable,'' analysts at <ORGANIZATION> Wright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, observed in a recent appraisal of the mergers-and-acquisitions craze But `` the longer-term effects of takeovers are less healthy for the economy and for equity investors generally.'' Excessive debt-leveraging of corporate assets makes companies more vulnerable in the event of a recession, the report said. `` In fact, there is the potential that defaults arising from high debt service requirements for companies with reduced cash flows will even aggravate the economy's troubles, when the next recession comes. `` Although industry consolidations and restructurings may often be useful for strengthening the competitive edge in global markets, the transformation of billions of dollars of equity into debt is eroding the financial footings of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry. `` Market volatility and instability have increased as a result of the takeover wave, with the effect of driving many individual investors out of the stock market for years to come, if not for good,'' it said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> noted that the greatest takeover wave in history was a basic cause of the stock market decline last October. The collapse was as severe as it was `` precisely because the takeover wave had pushed stock prices to artificially high levels,'' the report said. `` For that reason alone,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> concluded, `` one should find little comfort in the continuing high level of takeover activity.''

<HEAD>Control Of Futures Markets Remains Unresolved Issue</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Will be followed later in cycle with an ADD containing weekly
commodity price trends</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>

 One year after Black Monday, the question of which government agency should oversee the financial futures markets remains unresolved, a fact highlighted this past week at a gathering of futures industry leaders and regulators in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. A number of other crash-related issues also overhang the nation's futures and options exchanges, but none arouses a more emotional response among futures industry leaders than the control question, especially among officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest futures exchanges. Futures and options trading is regulated by the 14-year-old Commodities and <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Trading of stocks and bonds is regulated by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, set up in 1934 as part of the New Deal. Despite the undeniable link between the stock market and stock-index futures _ which can be used for either hedging stock positions or speculating on stock-market movements _ the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> exchanges have strongly opposed post-crash proposals that one agency should regulate both markets. Instead, they have argued for the creation of an agency that would coordinate sharing of trading information among all the financial markets. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in January to enlarge his agency's jurisdiction to give it `` direct regulatory authority'' over stock-index futures and any new futures contracts related to stocks. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on Thursday, <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> took a more lenient stance, saying post-crash efforts to better coordinate the activities of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> and the markets were working satisfactorily. `` Nonetheless,'' <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, `` I continue to believe that in the long term there needs to be an ability to look beyond the parochial concerns of each of the separate stock and futures markets. In the long run, unified jurisdiction over these increasingly linked and unified markets will prove to be desirable.'' Earlier in the day, while sitting on a discussion panel with <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> Chairwoman <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> and four futures industry leaders, <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> was even more conciliatory on the issue, saying that `` contrary to many press reports, I do not regard that as a very serious matter.'' <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brodsky </PERSON>, who also sat on the panel, expressed his position bluntly: `` I do n't think you need a single regulator to create cooperation.'' Ms. <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appointee who has been in office less than eight months, did not comment on the control issue but focused instead on the likelihood of increased regulation of futures trading under a <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a Democrat and most of the bills introduced in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the past year proposing greater regulation of the futures markets were sponsored by Democrats. But Ms. <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said she expected Republican Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to win the November election. The big question, she said, was whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would be willing to veto any futures-related legislation backed by a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> likely to be dominated by Democrats. The issue of regulatory jurisdiction over financial futures could come to a head next year when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must vote on reauthorizing the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> for another four years. By law, the agency dies next year unless reauthorized by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Chevron USA Plans 400 Fewer Jobs at Port Arthur Refinery</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PORT ARTHUR, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, citing increased competition and reduced profit, announced plans Friday to cut the workforce at its largest refinery by about 400 jobs. Company officials said a portion of the jobs will be eliminated through attrition and early retirement. The 4,000-acre plant was purchased by the <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary in 1984 from <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>, and employs more than 2,200 people. `` <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> has announced plans to streamline the refinery operations and the organization here to make the refinery more competitive _ and not only to make it more competitive, but to assure its continued operation,'' said company spokesman <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>. The exact number of layoffs will not be known until company officials meet with union leaders to discuss the changes, he said, but <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> plans to operate the plant with about 400 fewer employees. `` Any announcement involving a reduction in manpower is difficult, but this has come as something of a relief to many of our Port Arthur business people because it means that <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> has decided to keep the plant open,'' <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> said. A company task force had presented four options to improve refining operation profits, including the possibility of shutting down the plant, or reducing the workforce by more than half, <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> sasid. `` This was the best of the -LRB- task force -RRB- alternatives,'' he said. `` It's a relief that we did not have to go to the big numbers.'' The changes were prompted, in part, by continuing volatility in the energy industry, he said. `` It relates to the extremely competitive market in which this refinery functions,'' <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> said. `` This Gulf Coast region is the most competitive petroleum products market in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` We have not been competitive in this market for a long time.'' Smaller Chevron refining operations in <LOCATION> Pascagoula </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> have proven more profitable, he said. The Port Arthur refinery is the largest owned by <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>, with an operating capacity off 407,000 barrels of crude per day. After streamlining, which is expected to begin immediately, ready capacity will be about 329,000 barrels per day, <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> said. `` We've never run 400,000 barrels a day here,'' he said. A renewed marketing strategy calls for the refinery to place a greater emphasis on the production of petrochemicals, premium unleaded gasoline and lubricating base oils, <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> said. The plant is one of few along the gulf coast with its own packaging facilities. The company plans to complete the cutbacks by the end of the first quarter 1989, <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> said. The Port Arthur refinery first opened in 1901 and has undergone numerous renovations, including a $ 600-million improvement project in 1980, he said.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday its third-quarter profit fell 4.4 percent from a year ago, due mainly to weak retail advertising and lower ad revenue. For the three-month period ended Sept. 30, <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION>'s after-tax profit totaled $ 31.99 million, or 57 cents a share, down from $ 33.4 million, or 57 cents a share, in the year-ago period The latest quarter's net included $ 2.19 million from discontinued operations. Earlier this month, the company announced plans to sell its eight television stations. The media company's third quarter revenue rose 5.8 percent to $ 503.1 million from $ 475.6 million. `` A lower tax rate and the benefits of the repurchase of our own stock helped our earnings per share results during the quarter,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>, senior vice president and chief financial officer. `` Revenue growth from newspaper operations was a disappointing 3.2 percent. Retail and general advertising, mirroring nationwide trends, were both below our expectations,'' <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> said. For the first nine months, <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION>'s profit totaled $ 110.79 million, up 5.4 percent from $ 105.11 million in the same period in 1987. Revenue totaled $ 1.51 billion, up 4.8 percent from $ 1.44 billion in the year-earlier period.

<HEAD>Stocks, Consumer Prices Up; Oil, Bond Prices Down</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For Saturday PMs</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The stock market's best-known indicator edged up to its highest level of the year while bond prices lost ground and oil futures prices slipped. Consumer prices, meanwhile, posted their smallest gain in three months with a 0.3 percent advance in September, the government reported Friday. On Wall Street, stock prices finished mostly higher, lifting the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials by 2.31 points to 2,183.50. It was the third 1988 high this week as the blue-chip indicator scored a net gain for the week of 50.32 points. Bond prices moved lower, however. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s 30-year bond lost nearly $ 5 for every $ 1,000 in face value, pushing its yield toward 8.9 percent. In the oil futures market, prices edged lower as traders awaited word from two committees of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries that were meeting for a second day to discuss the cartel's overproduction. The increase in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Consumer Price Index meant consumer prices were rising at a moderate annual rate of 4.1 percent last month, down from an annual rate of 5.2 percent in August. The most recent inflation report triggered an automatic 4.0 percent cost-of-living increase for the nation's 38.4 million Social Security recipients, the second highest boost in the last 6 -LCB- years. The increase, which will increase the average retired worker's pension by $ 21 a month, will show up in January Economists, who had been worried about a new inflationary spiral fueled by tight labor markets and drought-driven food increases, said the price slowdown in September was an encouraging sign. `` The September price report should allay a lot of the inflationary fears that were in financial markets the past few months,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bassett </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, an economic consulting firm in <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>. For the first nine months of the year, inflation has been rising at an annual rate of 4.5 percent, little changed from the 4.4 percent increase for all of 1987 The 0.3 percent overall rise in consumer prices in September was down slightly from increases of 0.4 percent in July and August as gasoline prices fell by 1.7 percent, the biggest decline since February. However, food prices climbed 0.8 percent and clothing costs shot up 2.2 percent. These two components accounted for 70 percent of the September price increase. In another government report, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Americans' average weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent in September, after falling a sharp 1.3 percent in August, the worst drop in four years. The September increase stemmed from a rise in the number of hours worked and in the earnings per hour, which more than offset the increase in consumer prices.
